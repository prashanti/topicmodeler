Buffalo News (New York) 	January 11, 2009 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	Lions, tigers and (polar) bears, oh my!;  A massive extinction of animals is under way. The leading culprits are loss of habitat, overkilling and global warming, marked by the failure of governments to act. 	VIEWPOINTS; Pg. G1  	2620 words  	Children today may see a time when the fascinating, whimsical and ferocious animals they've grown up with in storybooks are extinct in the wild.LiNeBrEaKThink about it: Lions. Tigers. Polar bears. Rhinoceroses. Hippopotamuses. Elephants. Mountain gorillas. Whales.LiNeBrEaKGone.LiNeBrEaKThousands more lesser-known animals, such as the Malayan tapir, Dama gazelle and Hainian gibbon are also approaching the end of the line.LiNeBrEaK"It's sad to see in my lifetime the loss of so many species. It's like watching the end of the world in slow motion," said Donna Fernandes, president of the Buffalo Zoo.LiNeBrEaKCreatures on land, sea and air are under unprecedented assault around the world from loss of habitat, climate change, pollution, human population increases and overhunting and overfishing, scientists and other experts say. Saving them will require enforceable, far-ranging plans by individual governments and the international community that over the years have been unwilling or unable to do so, according to those who are in the trenches. LiNeBrEaK"We are really at a crisis. So many species are in decline right now," said Sybille Klenzendorf, managing director of the World Wildlife Fund's species conservation program.LiNeBrEaKThe WWF, based in Washington, D.C., was critical of a rule change issued in December by the Bush administration that weakens the Endangered Species Act in the United States. The organization also cast doubt in a report the same month on the long-term prospects for survival of "iconic" animal populations.LiNeBrEaKThe worldwide population of the rhinoceros, which has lived on Earth for 60 million years, is about 21,000, more than a 90 percent drop since 1970, the WWF said. The wild population of all tigers -- including Bengal, Sumatran, Siberian and Indochinese -- is believed to be between 4,000 and 5,000.LiNeBrEaK&gt;Red List 'bleak'LiNeBrEaKNumerous wildlife studies in recent years have drawn similarly dire conclusions, notably the annual Red List of Threatened Species report released in October by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The Swiss-based organization has, since 1963, cataloged the conservation status of the planet's wildlife, utilizing 1,700 experts in 130 countries for its current findings.LiNeBrEaKThe Red List assessment "paints a bleak picture," the project's leaders wrote. Among its conclusions:LiNeBrEaK16,928 of 44,838 species are threatened with extinction. A threatened species is considered likely to become in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future.LiNeBrEaKHalf of the world's 5,487 mammals are declining in population, and nearly a quarter are clinging to survival. That number could be as high as 36 percent, but insufficient data was available to classify the threat level of hundreds more.LiNeBrEaKOne in eight birds, one in three amphibians and one in two reptiles -- including half of all freshwater turtles -- are threatened with extinction.LiNeBrEaK99 percent of the threats are man-made.LiNeBrEaKThose findings are in league with ones published in May by the Living Planet Index, composed of the World Wildlife Fund and other nature organizations. That survey found the populations of mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles have dropped by almost a third in the last 35 years alone.LiNeBrEaK"You'd have to go back to the extinction of the dinosaurs [65 million years ago] to see a decline as rapid as this," said Jonathan Loh, the report's editor.LiNeBrEaKAmong the study's findings was that nearly 80 percent of primates -- including chimpanzees, humans' closest living relative sharing 96 percent of our DNA -- face extinction in South and Southeast Asia. The threats come from population pressures, habitat destruction and hunting for bush meat as well as for traditional medicines desired in Asian countries.LiNeBrEaKThe mountain gorilla now has only a tenuous hold on survival in the wild. Its numbers are down to an estimated 700 worldwide, with 200 under siege in war-torn Republic of Congo. In the same country, once-plentiful hippopotamuses have been slaughtered in recent years for the ivory in their teeth, reducing their numbers by some 95 percent. The International Union cited the poaching when it added the hippopotamus to its endangered list in 2006.LiNeBrEaKIn one glimmer of hope, the Wildlife Conservation Society, based in New York's Bronx Zoo and Congo, reported this summer that 125,000 western lowland gorillas, which are not classified as endangered, were living in Congo's forests, far more than previously thought.LiNeBrEaKNot so lucky is the orangutan. The Red List saw the Sumatran Orangutan's status changed to critically endangered this year, and the Bornean Orangutan's status downgraded to endangered. Both are threatened by habitat loss due to legal and illegal logging, including forest clearance for palm oil plantations.LiNeBrEaKThe World Wildlife Fund warns that, at the current rate of deforestation, orangutans will be extinct in the wild in 10 years.LiNeBrEaK&gt;Forests fallingLiNeBrEaKThe majority of threatened and endangered animal species are in the tropical continents of Cental and South America, in Africa south of the Sahara, and Southern and Southeast Asia. They are also home to the majority of the world's forests, and those are vanishing at alarming and unsustainable rates.LiNeBrEaKA 2007 study by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization found enormous tracts continue to disappear, especially where the highest rates of poverty and civil conflict occur. Africa, which accounts for 16 percent of the world's forests, lost more than 9 percent of its trees alone between 1990 and 2005. Latin America saw about 7 percent of its trees cut down over the same period.LiNeBrEaKAhmed Djoghlaf, executive director of the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity, warned in May that the world was losing forest cover at the rate of 36 football fields a minute. Nearly 100 countries no longer have forests, he said.LiNeBrEaKDjoghlaf blamed unregulated slash-and-burn farming practices, uncontrolled forest fires, illegal lumber trade and large-scale mining for the dramatic decline.LiNeBrEaKA report by the United Nations in 2001 painted a gloomy picture of the rain forest's long-term prospects.LiNeBrEaK"Short of a miraculous transformation in the attitude of people and governments, the Earth's remaining closed-canopy forests and associated biodiversity are destined to disappear in the coming decades," the report's forward said.LiNeBrEaKKlenzendorf of the World Wildlife Fund said paying third-world countries to protect their forests -- and the creatures that live in them -- may hold the key to reversing the decline.LiNeBrEaKThat idea is being developed for the next revision to the Kyoto Protocol, the U.N. agreement signed by 183 countries, though not the United States, aimed at stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKForests absorb and hold immense amounts of carbon dioxide, which would otherwise contribute to global warming. When they are cut down, the trees -- and often the soil under them -- release that carbon into the atmosphere, fueling climate change even faster.LiNeBrEaK"We are telling [governments] that this is a sustainable mechanism because you get paid every year. By allowing the forest to be cut down, you get paid only once," Klenzendorf said.LiNeBrEaK"It allows forests to be preserved, global warming to be ameliorated and poor countries to gain a direct financial benefit for forest preservation," said Bill Snape, senior counsel for the Center for Biological Diversity.LiNeBrEaK&gt;Global warming dangersLiNeBrEaKMan-made global warming change presents yet another challenge to survival.LiNeBrEaK"The two biggest factors, far and away, driving species toward extinction today are habitat loss or degradation, and that's been going on for a better part of a century and has accelerated since World War II, and global warming," Snape said.LiNeBrEaK"Unfortunately, the two are acting synergistically."LiNeBrEaKIn what could become another daunting problem, atmospheric changes may in the future force animals that migrate for food and water, reproduction and warmer temperatures to move beyond the borders of reserves set up as a last resort from civilization.LiNeBrEaKMarine biologists are already recording how climate change is affecting migratory patterns, ocean levels and acidity in the seas, putting numerous species in harm's way. Warming seas are also having a devastating impact on coral reefs, with even small but prolonged rises in sea temperature forcing a condition known as bleaching, in which food-producing algae are expelled.LiNeBrEaKEven without global warming, endangered fish and sea mammals -- and the ecosystems they inhabit -- are at risk from pollution, including toxic waste, and overfishing, including the use of mile-wide fishing nets from trawlers that scoop up everything in their path as they bulldoze the ocean floor.LiNeBrEaKPolar bears, which have become a symbol of global warming's harmful effects, are drowning and dying of starvation because of shrinking ice cover in the Arctic Circle. That prompted them to be designated as a threatened species last May by the U.S. Department of the Interior under the nation's Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaKHowever, the Bush administration rushed a rules change into effect in December that weakened the act. It came after Interior officials pored through 200,000 comments -- of which reportedly just 1 percent were in support of the change -- in 32 hours to meet a deadline.LiNeBrEaKThe change eliminated an independent scientific review by either the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on federal projects that could impact protected species. It also denies allowing the Endangered Species Act to regulate global climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe rule change, though not unexpected, angered environmentalists and some scientists.LiNeBrEaK"It certainly made a sham of the whole process of careful public review and consideration in changing our nation's most significant environmental law," said Robert Davison, a senior scientist with the Defenders of Wildlife and head of its Endangered Species and Wildlife Conservation program.LiNeBrEaKDavison and other environmental and animal protection organizations are hoping the incoming Obama administration, with Congress' help, will reverse that rule, and allow the Endangered Species Act to be used to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKThey're also hoping the new government will show leadership internationally in reversing the drive toward extinction.LiNeBrEaKSome biologists say mankind's future could depend on it, too.LiNeBrEaKA poll by the American Museum of Natural History found seven in 10 biologists believe a mass extinction of living things has begun, and it poses a major threat to human existence.LiNeBrEaK&gt;Big-game huntingLiNeBrEaKMike Powers, a Buffalo attorney and trophy hunter, has killed six of what big-game hunters classify in Africa as the Dangerous Seven: elephant, hippopotamus, lion, cape buffalo, leopard and crocodile. He anesthetized, rather than killed, the seventh, a rhinoceros, with tranquilizing arrows.LiNeBrEaKPowers said the animals were thriving in the parts of Africa where he killed them, and he felt no remorse doing so.LiNeBrEaK"Hunting has been around since the beginning of man. If done responsibly, it is a proper wildlife management tool, and an effective one," said Powers, vice chairman of the Erie County Republican Party in 2008.LiNeBrEaKHe said the meat from the animals was distributed to poor villagers.LiNeBrEaKTrophy hunting, he said, brings income to poor nations that is reinvested locally and can be used to preserve habitat and police poachers.LiNeBrEaK"It's one of conservation's greatest success stories," Powers said.LiNeBrEaKThat's a hotly debated issue. Many animal advocacy groups staunchly oppose trophy hunting of threatened or endangered species. The World Wildlife Fund's position on the controversial practice is less absolute, suggesting the decision be left to local communities. But the organization still says hunting should be a last resort.LiNeBrEaK"WWF urges that for threatened or endangered species, all other conservation incentives and activities [should] be fully explored before considering hunting them for trophies," a policy statement said.LiNeBrEaKEcotourism, rather than hunting, has gained cachet in recent years. Several studies suggest that ecotourism revenues are far more profitable and sustainable in the long run than earnings from trophy hunts.LiNeBrEaK&gt;Zoo programs helpLiNeBrEaKThe Buffalo Zoo participates in 28 captive breeding and resettlement programs for threatened and endangered species, including the snow leopard, Indian rhinoceros, Siberian tiger and Puerto Rican Crested Toad. The international program is designed to create viable populations with genetic diversity.LiNeBrEaKFernandes, the zoo president, said Golden Lion Tamirinds from the Buffalo Zoo were reintroduced to a Brazilian wilderness preserve, after first going to a "boot camp" at the National Zoo to learn how to forage on their own. Some 98 percent of the primate's former range has been destroyed by logging and conversion to farmland.LiNeBrEaKLast year, a baby addax, a critically endangered desert antelope, was born at the zoo. Less than 500 remain in the wild, but some are being reintroduced to several protected locations in the Saharan desert.LiNeBrEaK"Zoos work hard to have a remnant population and genetic diversity so we can rebuild some of these populations [if necessary]. It's just whether there will be habitats there to reproduce them," Fernandes said.LiNeBrEaKThe zoo has also sent a curator and two animal keepers in recent years to work on a breeding project for endangered amphibians in Panama. A quarter from the zoo's "Cars for Conservation" parking lot fee helps pay the salary of a Panamanian keeper at the facility.LiNeBrEaKStill, Fernandes said the zoos' efforts are just a drop in the bucket when looking at the magnitude of the problem.LiNeBrEaK"It just sickens me. I just can't even explain how all of us feel when we're asked [at zoological meetings] to start breeding programs for animals that we have no success with and no one's been able to breed in captivity."LiNeBrEaK"I sometimes feel like it's building sand castles, and the next wave comes in and tears down all your work. Everything is so close to the edge. There are no reserve populations anymore," Fernandes said.LiNeBrEaKShe still retains hope that animal species can recover if human pressures can somehow be removed.LiNeBrEaK"I'm hoping people will realize there is hope if they take an active role in changing their behavior, and in supporting organizations trying to halt extinction," Fernandes said.LiNeBrEaKTime, she said, is of the essence.LiNeBrEaKFernandes went to Venezuela before the opening of the zoo's new rain forest exhibit, and noticed a marked decline of forested areas since visiting 25 years earlier. She's seen the same decline in parts of Africa.LiNeBrEaKSometimes, she confesses, the dismal state of affairs for animals and nature makes her yearn for another time.LiNeBrEaK"I sometimes wish I could time travel back 200 years ago, and see the world the way it was," Fernandes said.LiNeBrEaKe-mail: msommer@buffnews.comLiNeBrEaKGoing, going ...?LiNeBrEaKSome of the world?s largest animals are in declineLiNeBrEaKRHINOCEROS: Population has plummeted more than 90 percent since 1970.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 11, 2009 Sunday 	Inaugural balls making effort to minimize impact on environment: For fancy inaugural balls, it'll be peace, no fur and Segways  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	989 words  	Jan. 11--WASHINGTON  -- WASHINGTON -- For the inauguration of a president who promised to be a friend of the environment, what would you expect but carbon-neutral inaugural balls, hybrid Lexuses, organic menus and valet bicycle parking?LiNeBrEaKPolitical correctness will rule the day. LiNeBrEaKTwo Green Inaugural Balls are planned, including one featuring a green carpet made from--what else?--a recycled rug. Official invitations to the Jan. 20 inauguration are being printed on recycled paper. The homeless will be handed furs.LiNeBrEaKWith millions of visitors headed to Washington for President-elect Barack Obama's swearing-in, "Our goal is to create an unforgettable evening while treading lightly on the Earth," said Jenna Mack, an organizer of one Green Inaugural Ball--not to be confused with another Green Inaugural Ball featuring Al Gore.LiNeBrEaKBeyond the Earth-minded, nearly every imaginable group is planning an event to promote a cause.LiNeBrEaKPETA plans to give away fur coats to the homeless while offering hot soy milk cocoa in cups that read: "Thank You for Not Wearing Fur!"LiNeBrEaK"We expect that the only fur on the streets on Jan. 20 will be on homeless people," said Bruce Friedrich, PETA vice president.LiNeBrEaKThe furs, collected from people who don't want them anymore, will be marked with black paint before they are given away so that they cannot be sold.LiNeBrEaKAmong other celebrations with a cause: The Peace Ball, billed as "the largest gathering of peace activists without a protest."LiNeBrEaKThe greening of the inauguration is drawing a special effort, because Obama has made "green" projects a centerpiece of his economic stimulus plan and is expected to highlight the environment in his inaugural address.LiNeBrEaK"Not only are we committed to holding an inauguration that is the most open and accessible in history," said Linda Douglass, chief spokeswoman for Obama's inaugural committee, "but we are also committed to making sure that it is as environmentally friendly and sustainable as possible."LiNeBrEaKThe Environmental Protection Agency has provided a liaison to the Presidential Inaugural Committee to advise on "best practices"--a first, Douglass said.LiNeBrEaK"We're obviously not going to have paper towels in the bathroom," said Shelley Cohen, helping organize the event featuring Gore, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize for efforts in preventing climate change. "We're going to have air dryers."LiNeBrEaK"Making the inaugural balls as low-energy and low-carbon as possible won't stop global warming, but it is a very important symbol about the direction of the incoming administration," said Dan Weiss, director of climate strategy for the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.LiNeBrEaKTo reduce the inauguration's carbon footprint, attendees are being encouraged to carpool or ride public transit, even in evening gowns and tuxedos. If they must drive, they are being encouraged to drive a hybrid vehicle or buy carbon offsets.LiNeBrEaKOrganizers of a number of balls plan to use energy-efficient lighting. But no one has figured out a way to hook up to a wind turbine exhibit on display near the U.S. Capitol.LiNeBrEaK"Downtown D.C. is hardly an optimal place for a wind turbine," said Ron Stimmel of the American Wind Energy Association.LiNeBrEaKSome of the floats in the inaugural parade are being recycled from past parades, including a 60-foot-long, 24-foot-tall American flag float built for Ronald Reagan's 1985 inauguration.LiNeBrEaKJimmy Carter made an attempt to be eco-friendly during his inauguration: The White House reviewing stand was supposed to be solar-heated. It did not work out as planned, said Albert Nason, archivist at the Jimmy Carter Library. Rosalynn Carter wrote: "Though it is supposedly a solar booth, something has happened to the sun this day and the booth's heater doesn't work."LiNeBrEaK"People have forgotten what a difference presidential leadership can make," Weiss said.LiNeBrEaKNot everyone's buying it, though.LiNeBrEaK"We've had the Christmas season, and it appears we're entering the silly season with efforts by many to look as if they're saving the environment when they're really not doing anything but engaging in feel-good politics," said Brian Darling of the conservative Heritage Foundation. "In reality, this whole inaugural is going to have a massive carbon footprint."LiNeBrEaKDarling expects to see far more gas-guzzling SUVs than bikes as people head to inaugural balls.LiNeBrEaK"If they really want to be environmental, maybe they'll take measures to invite fewer people to Washington," he said, noting the huge carbon footprint that millions of people will leave.LiNeBrEaKFor some, it's just practical to leave the car at home.LiNeBrEaKAt Segs in the City, which rents Segways, one-third of the fleet is already reserved. One business needed a way to make deliveries downtown without using cars, which will be prohibited. Other people need to get to work.LiNeBrEaK"People who work in offices and knew they would not be able to get back and forth throughout the day are just using them instead of their vehicle and their feet," said Kenny Ellington, a tour guide for the company.LiNeBrEaKWhile inaugural organizers try to promote a new sense of green-being, all receptions and catered events in the House of Representatives will feature biodegradable containers, plates and utensils, many made from corn resin.LiNeBrEaKAll plastics and Styrofoam are banned. Caterers put food scraps, containers and utensils into a "composting stream" for a facility in Maryland, an effort going on for more than a year.LiNeBrEaKPerry Plumart of the Green the Capitol office for the House said: "It goes from trash to dirt in 90 days."LiNeBrEaKrichard.simon@latimes.comLiNeBrEaKjzuckman@tribune.com	ENVIRONMENTALISM (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); MATERIALS RECOVERY and RECYCLING (77%); PAPER and PACKAGING PRODUCTS (75%); HOMELESSNESS (75%); FUR and LEATHER CLOTHING (72%); AWARDS and PRIZES (72%); NOBEL PRIZES (69%); BEST PRACTICES (61%); GLOBAL WARMING (60%); OBAMA'S FIRST 100 DAYS (90%); US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009 (70%); US PRESIDENTS (78%)  	BARACK OBAMA (84%); AL GORE (70%)  	CHICAGO, IL, USA (89%) EARTH (92%); ILLINOIS, USA (89%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 11, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Chicago Tribune   	Richard Simon and Jill Zuckman, Chicago Tribune  	PEOPLE FOR THE ETHICAL TREATMENT OF ANIMALS (83%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	Arts  	20090111-TB-Inaugural-balls-making-effort-to-minimize-impact-on-environment-0111  	TB  														
Chico Enterprise-Record (California)  	January 11, 2009 Sunday 	New water association leader wants to tell California's story  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	620 words  	Jan. 11--The Northern California Water Association has a new leader in Donn Zea, who said he is eager to find points on which California leaders agree, and to tell Northern California's story.LiNeBrEaKZea, who most recently worked for the California Forest Products Commission, said in childhood he had envisioned himself working in environmental management.LiNeBrEaKWhen he came in a point of his career where he knew he would seek another turning point, he thought he would likely end up in either water or energy, Zea said. LiNeBrEaKSo when the opportunity arose at NCWA, Zea said he felt he was a good fit. "This issue combines complexity, my passion for the environment and the intricacies of public policy issues," Zea said.LiNeBrEaKHe had learned working in forestry issues that his "learning curve was steep."LiNeBrEaK"By no means did I want to pretend I was an expert," he continued. "I can be here for 10 years and will still never consider myself the expert. But I will know who is."LiNeBrEaKFor his interviews for the new NCWA post, Zea said he told the board it needed to be "telling a very important story more clearly and more loudly."LiNeBrEaKNCWA has a limited budget and California is a large state, which makes the job a challenge, Zea said. Currently, the state is grappling with large issues, including drought, water delivery cutbacks, climate change and environmental needs.LiNeBrEaKRecently, the state also completed the Delta Vision report, an ambitious plan for retooling the timing of diversions, better managing water storageLiNeBrEaKand delivery, shoring up levees and adapting for the future.LiNeBrEaKChanges from the Delta Vision process have yet to be put into place.LiNeBrEaKYet, "if the political machine kicks in, we need to show them what we are already doing with integrated management, water use efficiency, environmental planning and what we do for habitat, so we can take care of what we do in Northern California first," Zea said.LiNeBrEaKHe said at the top of his list of goals is to work with "all of the parties in this dialogue ... to get beyond rhetoric and get to action."LiNeBrEaK"I believe these problems can be solved" before they reach a crisis, he said.LiNeBrEaKOne way to get that message across is to talk to elected officials.LiNeBrEaKThe more they know, by seeing things first-hand, the more they will be able to make better policy decisions, he said.LiNeBrEaKHe said he'll start with protection of the qualities people appreciate in Northern California.LiNeBrEaK"It doesn't do any good to take what we're building up here with efficiency and environmental ethics, and tear it apart in order to provide a political solution to the water needs of other places," Zea said.LiNeBrEaK"If we do a better job of explaining, people will be less apt to just take things from us.LiNeBrEaK"What we need to do is try to stay out of court and stay in the conference room and keep talking and keep finding ways to make things work."LiNeBrEaKNorthern California Water Association is a group with membership of 54 water suppliers and individual farmers who together irrigate more than 800,000 acres of land in Northern California.LiNeBrEaKZea, 50, lives in Grass Valley.

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 11, 2009 Sunday 	Climate change may be stoking stronger winds, altered oceans  	SCIENCE; Environment; News; Business  	1010 words  	The specter of an ocean floor littered with dead shellfish, rock fish, sea stars and other marine life off the Oregon coast spurred Mark Snyder, a climate change expert, to investigate whether California's coast faced a similar calamity.LiNeBrEaKIt could, the UC Santa Cruz earth scientist said, citing climate change, which some scientists believe is responsible for stronger and more persistent winds along the coast. There's no debate that windier conditions drive more upwelling of nutrient-rich deep ocean waters. LiNeBrEaKAt normal levels, this upwelling sustains the abundance of marine life, but too much of these rich waters leads to a boom-and-bust cycle that ultimately creates ocean "dead zones" with little or no oxygen. Marine life that can't swim or scuttle away from these lethal zones suffocate.LiNeBrEaKTo assess future wind and upwelling scenarios along the California coast, Snyder and his colleagues at UC Santa Cruz ran climate simulations for two time periods. One spanned from 1968 to 2000, verifying the accuracy of the modeling. The second simulated the region's estimated climate from 2038 to 2070, using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change "high-growth" emissions projections. Snyder said he chose the high emissions scenario because today's are exceeding earlier IPCC estimates.LiNeBrEaKThe results showed increases in wind speeds of as much as 2 meters per second, a 40 percent increase from current wind speeds, which now average 5 meters per second, Snyder said.LiNeBrEaKThe change in wind speeds is already happening, Snyder said. California winds have been growing in strength in the past 30 years.LiNeBrEaKSnyder said he knows his hypothesis needs more research, so he'll know whether to continue pursuing it or to discard it. The latter is unlikely, he said, given the new cycle of dead zones on the Oregon and Washington coasts that started in 2002.LiNeBrEaK"It was just chance they found the dead zones in Oregon," Snyder said, describing how fishers reported to marine scientists an alarming number of dead or dying crabs they were pulling up in traps.LiNeBrEaK"It's quite possible these areas could be off the California coast," he said.LiNeBrEaKAfter the Oregon fishers reported their sickly catches, and divers described seeing bottom-dwelling fish in high waters or schools of fishes massing near an invisible wall   behind which was low-oxygen water   scientists from Oregon State University, along with state and federal marine experts, began investigating.LiNeBrEaKThat year, and in years since, researchers have sent down a robot equipped with a video camera to record the carnage. They've also deployed a fleet of robotic "gliders" to maintain constant vigil on oxygen levels and other conditions along the Oregon coast, as well as a sophisticated monitoring buoy.LiNeBrEaKThe worst year recorded was 2006, with the dead zone near the coast spreading from southern Oregon into Washington, where dead fish and crabs washed up on beaches along the Olympic Peninsula. Less severe dead zones returned in 2007.LiNeBrEaK"We've seen areas that are carpeted with dead marine life," said Oregon State marine ecologist Francis Chan. One video image stuck in his mind: A large dead sea star that must have been decades old, rotting in the water. Marine life such as that, which adhere to rocks most of their lives, can't scurry away from suffocating waters, he said. "It was pretty striking."LiNeBrEaKIn normal years, winds blowing from north to south drive upwelling in the spring and summer months off the Pacific Coast. These strengthened winds drive surface waters offshore, making room for deeper, nutrient-rich waters to surface, where sunlight triggers a heavy growth of phytoplankton, the bottom rung of the marine food chain.LiNeBrEaKBut when the winds don't slacken and upwelling persists, excess phytoplankton blooms. When the uneaten plankton dies and sinks to the ocean floor, bacteria consuming it deplete the oxygen in the water.LiNeBrEaKLike so many other climate change projections, the scientists know they can't definitely point to greenhouse gases as the sole culprit behind windier conditions along the coast. But no other explanation fits, given the historical patterns of winds and upwelling, according to a primer from Oregon State on hypoxia, the technical term for oxygen depletion in waters.LiNeBrEaKA phenomenon called El Ni&ntilde;o, which cycles in and out, doesn't explain it, or what's known as decadal oscillations, Chan said. "They're not at play here," Chan said. "So something else is likely at play."LiNeBrEaKOther scientists aren't convinced that wind-driven upwelling is occurring off the California coast. It is known that oxygen levels have been declining in deeper waters since 1984, when researchers started monitoring it in California coastal waters.LiNeBrEaK"That's something we're seeing along the California coast," said Frank Schwing, an oceanographer with the Southwest Fisheries Science Center in Pacific Grove.LiNeBrEaKAlthough large bodies of oxygen-poor water far offshore are normal, the rapid expansion of these waters is not. And scientists link it, in part, to climate change, Schwing said.LiNeBrEaKThese offshore low-oxygen waters in California differ from dead zones in Oregon. The latter are close to shore, where they've never been seen before, and they're killing sea life. Such die-offs haven't been seen in California.LiNeBrEaK"If you drive up Highway 101, you're not going to look far off to see dead zones," said Chan, with Oregon State. "They're less than a mile from the surf zone." But the expansion of these large volumes of hypoxic water far off the California coast does increase the odds they could reach the coastline, Schwing said. It also narrows the band of oxygen-rich surface waters far offshore that can sustain life.LiNeBrEaK"The implication is it's easier to create these hypoxic events," Schwing said.LiNeBrEaKFor Chan, the phenomenon drives home the sensitivity and dynamism of the ocean, which responds swiftly to atmospheric changes.LiNeBrEaK"We shouldn't be seeing these big changes, not in something as simple as oxygen levels on our coast," he said. "And we're seeing these big flips."LiNeBrEaKReach Suzanne Bohan at 510-262-2789 sbohan@bayareanewsgroup.com	CLIMATOLOGY (90%); COASTAL AREAS (90%); WEATHER (90%); OCEANS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); RESEARCH (89%); SCIENCE NEWS (89%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); OCEANOGRAPHY (78%); BIOLOGY (78%); ROBOTICS (60%)  		SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (92%); SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA (79%) OREGON, USA (96%); CALIFORNIA, USA (95%); WEST USA (79%) UNITED STATES (96%)  	January 12, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved  	By Suzanne Bohan Contra Costa Times  	INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (55%)  	A California Department of Forestry helicopter moves in close to wildfire flames to make a water drop over the Del Dios neighborhood of Escondido, Calif.

The Columbian (Washington)  	January 11, 2009 Sunday 	Legislative Preview: Southwest Washington loses clout  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	751 words  	Jan. 11--Southwest Washington has lost some clout in Olympia with the retirement of Democratic Rep. Bill Fromhold, a political insider with expertise in education, pensions and tax policy who was admired on both sides of the aisle.LiNeBrEaKFurthermore, Sen. Craig Pridemore, D-Vancouver, gave up his post as vice chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee after he lobbied for the budget-writing committee's top job. LiNeBrEaKThough some political bloggers speculated that he was punished for challenging Chairwoman Margarita Prentice, Pridemore told The Columbian he didn't want the No. 2 job again because it took all his time and left none for working on environmental bills that are closest to his heart.LiNeBrEaKInstead, he will serve as vice chairman of a key environmental committee. He plans to sponsor bills that would adopt a "cap and reduce" carbon emissions program, require recycling of fluorescent light bulbs, and impose fees on oil shipping companies to help pay for the cleanup of Puget Sound.LiNeBrEaKTwo Democratic newcomers, Rep. Jim Jacks in the 49th District and Rep. Tim Probst in the 17th, scored big with key committee assignments.LiNeBrEaKProbst, who heads the Washington Workforce Association, will be in a position to influence both education policy and school funding as vice chairman of the House Education Committee and a member of the Education Appropriations Committee. Building on his experience linking the classroom to the workplace, he'll also serve on the Community and Economic Development and Trade Committee.LiNeBrEaK"My assignments will really help me focus on economic recovery and on improving our school system," Probst said.LiNeBrEaKJacks, formerly Gregoire's representative to Southwest Washington, will serve as vice chairman of the Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee. He'll also be on the Capital Budget Committee, which approves bricks-and-mortar projects throughout the state, and the Technology, Energy and Communications Committee, where he hopes to influence alternative energy and climate change legislation.LiNeBrEaK"Someone from Southwest Washington should be on the Capital Budget Committee," Jacks said. Fromhold, who chaired that committee in 2007 and 2008, helped deliver several projects for Clark County.LiNeBrEaKThe committee could be pivotal in moving forward projects under the Obama administration's stimulus program, Jacks said. But how that might play out is still unknown. "The federal government hasn't told anyone what the rules of the road will be. We don't know how much money or what strings will be attached."LiNeBrEaKRep. Deb Wallace, a 17th District Democrat, will retain her chairmanship of the House Higher Education Committee.LiNeBrEaKAnd Rep. Jim Moeller, D-Vancouver, will have a full plate, adding Transportation to his assignments on the House Health Care and Wellness, Commerce and Labor and Rules committees.LiNeBrEaKOn the Republican side, Sen. Joe Zarelli, R-Ridgefield, will continue as ranking Republican on Ways and Means and also serve as lead Republican on the newly renamed Economic Development, Trade and Innovation Committee.LiNeBrEaKZarelli, the Senate's lead Republican on all budget and revenue matters, won bipartisan respect for advocating establishment of a rainy day reserve fund. He was one of the first lawmakers to propose hiring freezes and a moratorium on travel last fall when the extent of the deficit became clear.LiNeBrEaKRep. Ed Orcutt, R-Kalama, will continue as ranking Republican on the House Finance Committee, where he promises to oppose tax increase proposals. "I'd like to see some tax relief for businesses to stimulate the economy, but I'm afraid with the budget the way it is, that will be a tall order," he said.LiNeBrEaKRep. Jaime Herrera, who won election in November to the seat she filled by appointment last year, will continue on House Transportation, She vows to fight delays in the construction schedule for several highway projects in her district. She'll also serve on the Health and Human Services Appropriations Committee.LiNeBrEaKSen.

Hickory Daily Record (North Carolina)  	January 11, 2009 Sunday 	Stroke leaves artist in wheelchair, doesn't dampen drive to create  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	820 words  	Jan. 11--HICKORY -- James Preslar used to back blocks away from his work to see the full extent of what he created. He painted murals, bigger-than-life pieces that ran from floors to ceilings and across whole exterior walls -- a 40-foot rainbow, a 32-foot-long image of deer he stumbled upon in his beloved British Columbia. He put his pieces on wheels thanks to commissions to cover mammoth horse trailers with paintings of cowboys and campfires and grand, green hills.LiNeBrEaKA stroke in 2005 left Preslar, 59, in a wheelchair, able to do little more than speak and use his left arm and three fingers. It meant he traded his Vale farm and its dogs and miniature horses for a room at Hickory's Brian Center Health and Rehabilitation. It did not mean he lost his perspective. LiNeBrEaKFor a year after the stroke, Preslar said he barely moved or talked and mostly lay in bed. He went from Grace Hospital in Morganton to Frye Regional in Hickory to a facility in Charlotte and was in Salisbury's Brian Center before asking to come back to Hickory to be closer to his mother, Grace Saine Preslar Wright, a resident at Camelot Manor in Granite Falls.LiNeBrEaKWhen he came home, Preslar got his computer back. Then he started getting his life back.LiNeBrEaKHe kept up with current events and became a regular, if scathing, commenter on online forums for readers.LiNeBrEaKHe was horrified by what he read about global warming, using his three good fingers to write a nearly 9,000-word paper on the subject for the International Society for Philosophical Enquiry, a society for people with high IQs.LiNeBrEaKHe collected thousands of pictures he found online, images that spoke to the artist still in him.LiNeBrEaK"I'm in a small room but I don't feel like it because I collect the images," he said. "I have over 30,000, from microscopic stuff to cosmic stuff."LiNeBrEaKSomewhere in between, Preslar found his place in a world he knows isn't fair but one in which he is single-minded in making his own way.LiNeBrEaKHe discovered software that can, with enough practice and persistence, allow him to create three-dimensional artwork and graphics, even with limited mobility. The brain that left Preslar in the wheelchair, that forgot what it knew about commanding the hands of a muralist, did not forget why it was commanding those hands in the first place.LiNeBrEaK"Art calls to you," Preslar said. "That's what's happening now. I really have to do it. I don't know how, but I have to."LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, after he learned the state Vocational Rehabilitation office would consider funding him if he came up with a business plan, Preslar started working on his associate's degree in business through an online Axia College program. He graduated in December. Last week he began online classes to earn his bachelor's degree in visual communication.LiNeBrEaKThomas Southerland, a social worker at the Brian Center, doesn't doubt Preslar will finish that, too. He knows Preslar isn't simply letting life happen to him. He hears the man talk about politics and gets the articles Preslar sends him about going green.LiNeBrEaK"A lot of people come into a nursing home and just give up," Southerland said. "People see it as a last stop. James doesn't."LiNeBrEaKIt is obvious Preslar refuses to give up. "Sitting in a wheelchair waiting to die isn't for me," he said more than once. But neither does he want to settle for less than what he once had.LiNeBrEaKAs he worked his way through British Columbia only a couple years after finishing Hickory High School, Preslar fell in love with independence. He worked as a sign painter and ran a graphics studio before the mural work took over his schedule.LiNeBrEaKThe sunlight that dictated when he could start and stop painting was his only boss and he liked it that way. Preslar insists he will work only on a freelance basis when, not if, he masters the animation software and finishes school.LiNeBrEaKAnd he hasn't given up on the idea of drawing again. He recently ordered a sketchpad.LiNeBrEaK"I deal with the hand I am dealt and hope that one day my legs and my hands are returned to me," he said. "But I'm not going to sit here and wait."LiNeBrEaKWhile Preslar is busy learning and re-learning, he is teaching, too.LiNeBrEaKAt the same time he's working on a degree, he's working on feeding himself, said Douglas Scott, a residential care specialist at the Brian Center.LiNeBrEaK"He's very ambitious when it comes to never letting his disability or what he's going through keep him from achieving what he wants out of life," Scott said. "He's been inspirational. It makes you think, when you go out in life, 'I can do anything' because he proves you can."

The Houston Chronicle 	January 11, 2009 Sunday   3 STAR EDITION	No King Coal;  Dynegy's decision to back off new coal-fired power plants is good for its image and the environment. 	OUTLOOK; Pg. 2  	572 words  	AFTER signalling that it was aggressively pursuing new coal-fired power plant projects that would have made it one of the major builders of the controversial carbon generators, Houston-based Dynegy has made a welcome change of course. LiNeBrEaKThe company kicked off the new year with the announcement that it was dissolving a 2-year-old joint venture with New York-based LS Power Associates, ending its participation in at least five planned coal-fueled facilities around the country that would have produced an estimated 30 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually. The move brought cheers from environmental groups that had protested Dynegy's involvement in a new generation of plants they contended would exacerbate global warming caused by industrial carbon dioxide emissions and intensify health-threatening pollution in surrounding communities.LiNeBrEaKGreen America climate action committee coordinator Yochi Zakai had protested at the Dynegy stockholders meeting in Houston last year and hailed the company's decision to back away from the coal plant projects. "Dynegy - the company that was being called `the next king coal' for its extensive new power plant plans - has all but given up pursuit of that throne," commented Zakai. "2009 promises to be a landmark growth year for clean energy and with this development coal-fired power is one step closer to being mothballed once and for all in the U.S."LiNeBrEaKLS Power, which holds 40 percent of Dynegy's stock, indicated it still planned to pursue some of the new plant construction. This week, however, it cancelled a proposed coal-fired plant in Iowa, and another in Georgia is financially threatened. A Sierra Club spokesman questioned whether LS Power had the financial wherewithal or the expertise to carry on after Dynegy's departure.LiNeBrEaK"LS Power has not developed or operated coal plants," said the spokesman, "and as they stand alone now we encourage them to shift their investments into cleaner alternatives like wind, solar and efficiency that can create new jobs and economic opportunity while cutting pollution, improving public health and helping solve global warming."LiNeBrEaKDynegy Chairman Bruce A. Williamson indicated that the company's motivation for changing course was partly financial and partly a recognition of the increasing hurdles to building coal-fired power generators. According to Williamson, "the development of new generation is increasingly marked by barriers to entry including external credit and regulatory factors that make development much more uncertain."LiNeBrEaKUntil technologies to create clean-burning coal plants are perfected, bringing a new generation of plants on line is environmentally irresponsible and financially risky.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama's commitment to a comprehensive carbon reduction plan all but guarantees that some form of carbon tax or cap and trade system will be passed by Congress that will penalize industries with large greenhouse gas footprints. In recognition of that picture, after the company's announcement, Dynegy stock rose 38 cents a share, up 19 percent.LiNeBrEaKHouston must become the capital for the developing alternative energy industry that will provide long-term solutions to global warming. In that future, companies with sooty hands will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage.LiNeBrEaKDynegy officials deserve credit for moving in a new direction that will ultimately benefit the city, their stockholders and their customers.

The Houston Chronicle 	January 11, 2009 Sunday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Iconic moose may lose battle with climate change;  The beasts are dying off in the Midwest, failing to adapt to warmer temperatures 	A; Pg. 17  	658 words  	CHICAGO - It wasn't long ago that thousands of moose roamed the gentle terrain of northwestern Minnesota, affirming the iconic status of the antlered, bony-kneed beast from the North Woods. In just two decades, though, their numbers have plummeted, from 4,000 to fewer than a hundred.LiNeBrEaKThey didn't move away. They just died. LiNeBrEaKThe primary culprit in what is known as the moose mystery, scientists say, is climate change, which has systematically reduced the Midwest's already dwindling moose population and provoked alarm in Minnesota, where wildlife specialists gathered for a "moose summit" last month in Duluth.LiNeBrEaK"There's not a lot of opportunity to turn this around," said Mark Lenarz, a wildlife research specialist at the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. "Here in Minnesota, they (moose) have been weakened by climate change."LiNeBrEaKTemperatures tell much of the story. Over the past 40 years in northwest Minnesota, the average winter temperature has risen significantly - 12 degrees - while summers are 4 degrees warmer.

The Houston Chronicle 	January 11, 2009 Sunday   2 STAR EDITION	Scientists identify suspect in Midwest moose mystery;  The iconic beasts are dying off, and climate change may be to blame 	A; Pg. 10  	954 words  	CHICAGO - It wasn't long ago that thousands of moose roamed the gentle terrain of northwestern Minnesota, affirming the iconic status of the antlered, bony-kneed beast from the North Woods. In just two decades, though, their numbers have plummeted, from 4,000 to fewer than a hundred.LiNeBrEaKThey didn't move away. They just died. LiNeBrEaKThe primary culprit in what is known as the moose mystery, scientists say, is climate change, which has systematically reduced the Midwest's already dwindling moose population and provoked alarm in Minnesota, where wildlife specialists gathered for a "moose summit" last month in Duluth.LiNeBrEaK"There's not a lot of opportunity to turn this around," said Mark Lenarz, a wildlife research specialist at the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. "Here in Minnesota, they (moose) have been weakened by climate change."LiNeBrEaKTemperatures tell much of the story. Over the past 40 years in northwest Minnesota, the average winter temperature has risen significantly - 12 degrees - while summers are 4 degrees warmer. Solitary and temperamentally grumpy, moose have made it clear in their estimated 13,000 years in North America that they hate warm weather.LiNeBrEaKThe mounting concern about the fate of the moose comes as the Bush administration is revising endangered species regulations in ways that prohibit federal agencies from evaluating the effects of increased global warming on endangered species.LiNeBrEaKNearly 50 percent dropLiNeBrEaKOfficially, the moose is not endangered in the United States. But it is in danger of disappearing from the Midwest, which is the far southern fringe of its range. Roughly 7,700 moose reside in Minnesota, nearly all in the northeast section of the state.

Heat, water and parasites play important roles, but temperatures are the trigger. While deer, wolves and bears have adapted to warmer temperatures, wildlife biologists say, the moose have suffered. Moose require shade, water and cool weather, each of which is dwindling in northwest Minnesota.LiNeBrEaKLenarz said the moose population in the northwestern part of Minnesota struggles among small patches of aspen woods and farmland.LiNeBrEaKWhen temperatures rise, the moose have to work harder to obtain food and find places to stay cool. Lenarz said that affects their immune systems, prevents them from putting on more fat in the summertime (which they need to get through the winter) and makes them vulnerable to infestations from parasites.LiNeBrEaKAlthough northeastern Minnesota is comparatively more moose-friendly - greater shade, more opportunities to cool off - the population is declining, albeit more gradually, by 10 percent to 13 percent per year. Lenarz said the pregnancy rate is a little more than half the norm for moose, and mortality rates are two to three times higher than the average.LiNeBrEaKHunting is not a significant factor. It is banned in northwest Minnesota and limited to 150 - bulls only - in the northeast.LiNeBrEaKHeading north to cooler climes is not an option.LiNeBrEaK"When moose are in trouble, they don't move. They die," said Rolf Peterson, a research professor at Michigan Tech and the chairman of the Minnesota Moose Advisory Committee.LiNeBrEaKOne-directional trendLiNeBrEaKPeterson has spent decades studying the interrelationship between moose and wolves, the only big animals on Isle Royale. Moose on the isolated island are not exposed to many of the threats from Minnesota - cars, hunters and multiple parasites carried by deer. Wolves are the predators. Yet a decade-long trend of hotter-than-normal summers, according to a report issued last March, has negatively affected moose. Along with a drop of nearly 2,000 moose since 1995, temperatures are rising, leaving moose more vulnerable to disease.LiNeBrEaKThe summer of 2007 was the driest of the last 45 years, the report said.LiNeBrEaK"I don't see the temperature change we're seeing as cyclical. The trend is definitely in one direction," Peterson said.LiNeBrEaKMoose can be moved, as a herd was transferred from Ontario to the Upper Peninsula in the mid-1980s. But the options and the chances for success, in the face of climate change, are formidable, he said.LiNeBrEaK"I'm not terribly hopeful that the trend can be reversed by something we can do," Peterson said. "There aren't too many things we can do."

The Houston Chronicle 	January 11, 2009 Sunday   3 STAR EDITION	Typewriters bring back memories of former life HALE: Laptop doesn't make right noise xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx  	STAR; Pg. 1  	669 words  	WINEDALE- Here at the old country place in Washington County, you've caught me in the barn.LiNeBrEaKFor most of three days I've been on a cleanup mission, hoping to make the place look more like a barn than a sanitary landfill.LiNeBrEaKThis is not really a barn, though. It's way too small, and ought to be called a tool shed. And its contents are all wrong. They're not barn things. LiNeBrEaKThere's no hay in here. No livestock feed. No farm implements.LiNeBrEaKHidden among the junk I find three sets of old golf clubs. Wire cages where dogs slept when they were pups. A couple of fly rods and three or four old tackle boxes. Bedrolls, now home for an assortment of spiders. A rusting metal detector. A warped tennis racket or two. A set of iron cooking utensils. Three or four more paragraphs of stuff like that.LiNeBrEaKNone of that surprised me. What surprised me was finding a clutch of six typewriters sitting back in a dark corner, collecting dirt-dauber nests.LiNeBrEaKI'd forgotten about those machines. Five of the six are IBM Selectrics. The sixth is a little L.C. Smith manual portable that I carried before electric typewriters came to the newspaper business. It had a nice case, but one day when I was packing for a trip I left the portable on the ground and backed over it. The case popped open, making a spectacular noise, and the typewriter flew out. Wasn't hurt much. I wrote the column on it for years after that.LiNeBrEaKFive electric typewriters living in a barn here in Washington County does seem a little peculiar. But to me, those machines are symbolic of one of my former lives, in which typewriters played vital roles.LiNeBrEaKIn 1984 when I left The Houston Post and came to work at the Chronicle, the only doubtful feeling I had about the move was that I'd be working on a computer, and I'd never again use a typewriter. I'd spent 32 years on typewriters at The Post, even after my co-workers switched to computers. Taking my typewriter away was like taking his hammer away from a carpenter.LiNeBrEaKEven after 25 years on a computer I still miss my typewriter. I loved its clackety-clackness. It spoke to me like no computer ever has.LiNeBrEaKIf one day the boss said to us all, "OK, gang, due to global warming and the threat of terrorism and the collapse of the economy, no more computers. We're going back to typewriters," I would celebrate.LiNeBrEaKThat'll never happen, and that daydream is not why I have six old typewriters in this barn. I acquired them for the same reason you adopted the stray dog that time - because it needed a home and nobody else would take it in. They're still here because I haven't been able to throw them out.LiNeBrEaKAnd now even if anybody wanted them, they are beyond salvation on account of dust and dirt daubers and rats and wasps.LiNeBrEaKJust a couple of days ago, after I began this barn clean-out, I found a home for one of these machines. A folk artist took it. I understand she intends to take it apart and use the lettering on the keys for some artistic purpose or other.LiNeBrEaKThat's fine. That's better, at least, than pitching the typewriters in the trash heap, which is where they'll go after I'm gone.LiNeBrEaKYou see that low-slung, streamlined machine that stands out among the others, the one with the spider web stretching halfway across the keyboard? That's my baby.LiNeBrEaKThat typewriter and I traveled some rough roads. We did three or four books together and wrote hundreds of columns that made house and car payments and paid grocery and doctor bills.LiNeBrEaKThis is the machine that a friend rigged with an inverter that plugged into the cigarette lighter of my old station wagon. The direct current of the battery was then changed to AC, which would power the typewriter.LiNeBrEaKIn a roadside park I could back that wagon up to a stump to use for a seat. Put the typewriter on the tailgate and do the column by the side of the highway. I loved doing that. I know, I could do it now with this laptop computer running on battery. But it wouldn't make the right noise.LiNeBrEaKI'm taking this old typewriter to the house. Clean it up. Maybe fix a nice stand for it, where it can rest in peace.

The Houston Chronicle 	January 11, 2009 Sunday   3 STAR EDITION	ENERGY;  Nuclear power's core of support gains strength;  Public opinion, government backing and greenhouse gas concerns have combined to create a more favorable time for going atomic	BUSINESS; Pg. 1  	1680 words  	After a decadeslong winter of discontent, a confluence of favorable events during the last 10 years has provided a spark to America's nuclear industry.LiNeBrEaKWith no major U.S. accidents during that period, public opinion has slowly swung in favor of splitting atoms to meet the country's voracious power demands. The cost of natural gas - a competitor to nuclear - spiked to $13 per thousand cubic feet last year, although it has since fallen. And in a world worried about carbon dioxide, nuclear energy stands out, because it produces virtually no greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKFinally, during a Bush administration friendly to nuclear power, the federal government has begun providing generous loan guarantees for new reactor construction.LiNeBrEaKBecause of these trends, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission during the last two years has received 17 applications for 26 new nuclear reactors, most of them at existing facilities. And during this year something will likely happen that hasn't in three decades: A U.S. power provider is expected to receive a license to begin clearing land for a new reactor. LiNeBrEaK"There's clearly momentum building in favor of nuclear energy," said Sean McDeavitt, a Texas AandM University assistant professor of nuclear engineering.LiNeBrEaKAmong the first to apply for a license was NRG Texas, which seeks to expand its existing South Texas Project near Bay City. The two proposed units, which the company expects would begin operations by 2016, would produce an additional 2,660 megawatts, enough electricity to supply 2. 1 million homes.LiNeBrEaK"We think nuclear energy plays an important role in the near future," said Kevin Howell, president of NRG Texas.LiNeBrEaKTwo other power providers also submitted license applications last year. Exelon wants to build two reactors in Victoria County, and Luminant wants to add two reactors to its Comanche Peak facility near Glen Rose in North Texas. Amarillo Power is expected to apply this year to license a two-reactor plant in the Panhandle, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.LiNeBrEaKEven most advocates of nuclear energy worry, however, that the present nuclear resurgence is transitory.LiNeBrEaKAs part of a 2005 energy law, billions of dollars in subsidies were offered to the first few energy companies that built plants. It's possible that after a few reactors are constructed and exhaust these benefits, new construction will cease.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama, too, has signaled a more cautious approach than President George W. Bush, saying the technology should proceed only if proved "safe and clean."LiNeBrEaKThe waste issueLiNeBrEaKAnd the issue of nuclear waste disposal remains a quagmire, with no imminent agreement to move forward on building a waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where the project is widely opposed. Obama's choice for energy secretary, Steven Chu, has previously expressed doubts about Yucca Mountain.LiNeBrEaK"I just don't think there will be a big renaissance," said Peter Hartley, an energy expert at Rice University. "I believe the new administration will be much tougher on nuclear energy. Even if they implement carbon dioxide controls, I think the result will be primarily more natural gas plants, rather than wind."LiNeBrEaKCoal dominatesLiNeBrEaKNuclear energy and natural gas now provide about 20 percent each of the country's electricity needs. Coal, by far the dirtiest energy source in terms of carbon dioxide, generates almost half the nation's electricity. In Texas, natural gas is the leading generation fuel at about 45 percent.LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide emission from natural gas is about half that of coal.LiNeBrEaKBut as consumers discovered last summer, the price of natural gas generally is tied to the price of oil and can rise quickly. Also, there remains a wide range of uncertainty about the total amount of recoverable natural gas in the world, and whether these reserves could sustain a natural gas economy for more than a few decades.LiNeBrEaKUranium aplentyLiNeBrEaKSo here's where nuclear energy has key advantages: There's enough uranium to power much of the world for decades, and the price is more stable than for fossil fuels. Once nuclear plants are built, operating costs are considerably cheaper than for any fossil fuel, including coal.LiNeBrEaKBut nuclear plants are expensive to build, costing billions, and prone to overruns, delays and environmental lawsuits.LiNeBrEaKAdd in capital costs, Rice's Hartley said, and nuclear energy becomes more expensive than coal or natural gas.LiNeBrEaKCritics point to priceLiNeBrEaKThis is a point seized upon by environmental groups - many of which haven't rallied behind nuclear energy despite its near-zero greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK"Nuclear power is the most expensive way anybody has ever figured out how to boil water," Josh Dorner of the Sierra Club said. "Ignoring the waste problem, you just can't justify the costs."LiNeBrEaKTwo pathsLiNeBrEaKAll this leads to a question: At this moment of opportunity for nuclear energy, when the outlook is more favorable than at any time since the 1960s, is there a path by which the United States might significantly increase its reliance on nuclear energy, address its waste issues and increase energy security?LiNeBrEaKExperts see two paths: One comes through policy, the other new technologies.LiNeBrEaKThe policy path is straightforward, though not easy, energy experts say: Further simplify regulatory approval for plants; pick a design like Japan and France have done to standardize the construction of plants; develop legislation to dissuade environmental lawsuits; and, finally, solve the nuclear waste issue.LiNeBrEaK"It would certainly take a Manhattan Project-type commitment to get that done," said McDeavitt, the AandM nuclear engineer, referring to the effort during World War II to develop the atomic bomb.LiNeBrEaKTechnological solutionsLiNeBrEaKA recognition of these policy hurdles has led to numerous technological approaches that circumvent some of the existing problems with nuclear energy and that one day may lead to a wider adoption of fission power.LiNeBrEaKThe broadest is an international effort by more than a dozen nations, including the U.S., to develop a new generation of reactors, called the Generation IV International Forum.LiNeBrEaKOne goal of this new reactor design is to use nearly all of the available natural uranium in a reaction. Most of today's reactors can use only a small fraction of the uranium fuel in nuclear reactions, typically less than 1 percent. Using a larger fraction and developing reprocessing techniques would greatly extend the lifetime of the world's supply of uranium and significantly cut waste.LiNeBrEaKThose involved in the initiative hope to deliver a design for commercial construction by 2030.LiNeBrEaKA second technological approach is to develop reactors that use thorium, a radioactive element that can be transformed into a uranium-based fuel. The reason for the interest in thorium is simple: There are enough thorium reserves to power the world for centuries.LiNeBrEaKThe United States has generally not supported research of thorium, because it transforms into uranium-233, which has the potential to be used for weapons. However, some countries with abundant thorium reserves but low amounts of uranium, such as India, have pushed the technology forward.LiNeBrEaKNow, the United States' position on thorium may be softening. In October, Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Harry Reid, D-Nev., sponsored legislation that would provide $250 million over five years to spur the development of thorium reactors.LiNeBrEaK"All I can do is put forward a technically feasible way to create all of the energy this planet needs for the next thousand years," said Peter McIntyre, a Texas AandM physicist who has worked on thorium reactors. "To move forward, it's up to the government to change its policy toward thorium power."LiNeBrEaK'Backyard' reactorsLiNeBrEaKAnother new approach involves making small "backyard" reactors. The most aggressive proponent is Santa Fe, N.M.-based Hyperion Power, which seeks to build hot-tub-size reactors that can generate 25 megawatts of electricity, or enough juice to power 20,000 homes.LiNeBrEaKThe company is already negotiating with several entities for the sale of 200 reactors, each at a cost of about $30 million. The idea is to deliver power at a cost of less than 10 cents a kilowatt-hour to locations - say remote areas of Alaska, military installations or industrial locations in Canada's tar sands - where it's difficult to obtain conventional power, said John Deal, Hyperion's chief executive officer.LiNeBrEaKHyperion is still finishing its manufacturing design and hopes to obtain federal licensing from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other bodies within a few years. Deal expects to deliver the first units to customers in less than five years.LiNeBrEaKMuch of the demand has come from overseas. The United States, where much antipathy remains toward nuclear energy despite public surveys showing falling opposition, will have to wait.LiNeBrEaK"Honestly," Deal said, "right now, I'm not really interested in fighting American ignorance about nuclear power."LiNeBrEaKNatural gas Sources of electric power Texas 44. 4% U.S. 21. 3%LiNeBrEaKCoal Sources of electric power Texas 36. 4% U.S. 48. 3%LiNeBrEaKNuclear Sources of electric power Texas 12. 9% U.S. 19. 2%LiNeBrEaKWind Sources of electric power Texas 4. 5% U.S. 1. 0%LiNeBrEaKHydroelectric Sources of electric power Texas 0. 3% U.S. 6. 9%LiNeBrEaKSolar and others Sources of electric power Texas 1. 6% U.S. 3. 3%LiNeBrEaKNote: 2008 through SeptemberLiNeBrEaKSources: U.S. Department of Energy; Electric Reliability Council of TexasLiNeBrEaKSPLIT ON ATOMSLiNeBrEaKSurveys five years apart show increasing support for nuclear power among Americans, although we remain sharply divided:LiNeBrEaKUSE MORE 28%LiNeBrEaKUSE LESS 47%LiNeBrEaKDON'T CHANGE 25%LiNeBrEaKUSE MORE 36%LiNeBrEaKUSE LESS 39%LiNeBrEaKDON'T CHANGE 25%LiNeBrEaKTEXAS GOING NUCLEAR?LiNeBrEaKThree power providers have submitted license applications to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission since late 2007 to build new nuclear reactors in Texas.

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Wisconsin) 	January 11, 2009 Sunday   Final Edition	Lawmakers go to work &lt;|&gt; Repairing economy among top issues for Wisconsin delegation  	A News; Pg. 6  	914 words  	Washington - The start of a new Congress can be much like the beginning of a new school year. There are the freshman lawmakers trying to learn the ropes, the senior legislators already engrossed in their own cliques and a mixture of possibility and dread in the air.LiNeBrEaK Democrats now in charge of both chambers of Congress and the White House are especially excited about the prospects for a new legislative session, laying out an ambitious set of priorities that start with coaxing a badly ailing economy back to health. Republicans are holding out hope that they won't just get steamrolled as Democrats pursue their goals. LiNeBrEaK Members of Wisconsin's congressional delegation have their own list of priorities, largely focusing on economic recovery and job creation. Many say they are hopeful the new Congress will begin to tackle some of the toughest problems facing the country, from the economic recession to climate change to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.LiNeBrEaK "This is a wonderful opportunity to get the priorities of the American people represented here," said Sen. Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat. "They want a real resolution to the health care issue. They want real independence from foreign oil. They want some kind of change in the way we're shipping jobs overseas."LiNeBrEaK Feingold says those are just some of the priorities he brings with him to a new session of Congress. Other top concerns for him include promoting vocational education, helping small businesses and investing in clean water technology.LiNeBrEaK Rep. Tammy Baldwin, a Madison Democrat who promised to fight for health care reform during her first run for the House in 1998, hopes the new Congress will finally be able to come up with ways to help provide access to health care to the millions of Americans who are now uninsured. She also expects Congress to push for measures that would start to put a dent in climate change. If Congress handles those two issues the right way, she said, they can have "a very stimulative role in our economy."LiNeBrEaK But Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Menomonee Falls Republican who has served on the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, warns that moves by Congress to limit carbon emissions could be disastrous for American companies.LiNeBrEaK "That will have a devastating effect on Wisconsin," said Sensenbrenner, who plans to focus much of his efforts on fighting proposals to curb emissions through a cap and trade system.LiNeBrEaK Rep. Paul Ryan, the top Republican on the Budget Committee, plans to continue to focus on issues dealing with the economy, fiscal policy, federal spending and the ballooning national debt. He says he is willing to work with congressional leaders and the Obama administration to find solutions to some of these issues.LiNeBrEaK "I want Barack Obama to succeed," he said. "If he does, then America succeeds."LiNeBrEaK Democrats are expressing similar bipartisan sentiments - for now.LiNeBrEaK "We're going to need to find some common ground to advance an agenda worthy of this country," said Rep.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Wisconsin)  	January 11, 2009 Sunday 	Wisconsin's representatives in Washington eager to pursue priorities in 2009: Health care, jobs among top issues as Obama takes office  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	585 words  	Jan. 11--WASHINGTON -- The start of a new Congress can be much like the beginning of a new school year. There are the freshman lawmakers trying to learn the ropes, the senior legislators already engrossed in their own cliques and a mixture of possibility and dread in the air.LiNeBrEaKDemocrats now in charge of both chambers of Congress and the White House are especially excited about the prospects for a new legislative session, laying out an ambitious set of priorities that start with coaxing a badly ailing economy back to health. Republicans are holding out hope that they won't just get steamrolled as Democrats pursue their goals. LiNeBrEaKMembers of Wisconsin's congressional delegation have their own list of priorities, largely focusing on economic recovery and job creation. Many say they are hopeful the new Congress will begin to tackle some of the toughest problems facing the country, from the economic recession to climate change to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.LiNeBrEaK"This is a wonderful opportunity to get the priorities of the American people represented here," said Sen. Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat. "They want a real resolution to the health care issue. They want real independence from foreign oil. They want some kind of change in the way we're shipping jobs overseas."LiNeBrEaKFeingold says those are just some of the priorities he brings with him to a new session of Congress. Other top concerns for him include promoting vocational education, helping small businesses and investing in clean water technology.LiNeBrEaKRep. Tammy Baldwin, a Madison Democrat who promised to fight for health care reform during her first run for the House in 1998, hopes the new Congress will finally be able to come up with ways to help provide access to health care to the millions of Americans who are now uninsured. She also expects Congress to push for measures that would start to put a dent in climate change. If Congress handles those two issues the right way, she said, they can have "a very stimulative role in our economy."LiNeBrEaKBut Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Menomonee Falls Republican who has served on the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, warns that moves by Congress to limit carbon emissions could be disastrous for American companies.LiNeBrEaK"That will have a devastating effect on Wisconsin," said Sensenbrenner, who plans to focus much of his efforts on fighting proposals to curb emissions through a cap and trade system.LiNeBrEaKRep. Paul Ryan, the top Republican on the Budget Committee, plans to continue to focus on issues dealing with the economy, fiscal policy, federal spending and the ballooning national debt. He says he is willing to work with congressional leaders and the Obama administration to find solutions to some of these issues.LiNeBrEaK"I want Barack Obama to succeed," he said. "If he does, then America succeeds."LiNeBrEaKDemocrats are expressing similar bipartisan sentiments -- for now.LiNeBrEaK"We're going to need to find some common ground to advance an agenda worthy of this country," said Rep. Ron Kind (D-La Crosse).LiNeBrEaKFor more information on legislation, go to thomas.loc.gov.

LiNeBrEaKJESSIA PRATERLiNeBrEaKDaphneLiNeBrEaKCounty property appraisalsLiNeBrEaKnot based on fair market valueLiNeBrEaKA lot of attention has been given to the property tax situation in Baldwin County during the last year. Perhaps some improvement has been produced by the tax assessor's office but it is hard to find.LiNeBrEaKIn the Perdido Bay area, waterfront property has been appraised in 2008 at $3,800 a front foot, $4,800 a front foot, $2200 a front foot and $1,900 a front foot - quite a diversity for the same body of water. My personal waterfront appraisals have increased 82 percent from 2006-08. This has occurred in a period when we are told by government reports that property values have decreased 20 percent.LiNeBrEaKI am under the impression that property is to be taxed at fair market value. Fair market value is defined as the price that someone is willing to pay for the property.LiNeBrEaKIt appears to me that taxes in Baldwin County are being levied based on what the county and/or the state feel they need, rather than fair market value. The county needs to revisit annual appraisals as it is not realistic to think that all properties can be physically appraised during a 12-month period.LiNeBrEaKIf you want to understand how your taxes are arrived at, Google "Baldwin County Property" click the Delta search engine, click property appraisals, put in your PIN number of your property of your name and check both pages (click View tax record) for the second page. The land value appraisal will show there. Check the value of your property this year and compare it to the value you pay taxes on.LiNeBrEaKThere is limited information on the 2008 valuation notice. The appraised value, the assessed value and the estimated tax was shown for the current year and the previous year on last year's notice. The current valuation gives no information to show if your property values have changed.LiNeBrEaKCLAYTON KILGORELiNeBrEaKPerdido BeachLiNeBrEaKAl Gore's CO2 globalLiNeBrEaKwarming scam succeedingLiNeBrEaKThis is in response to the letter that appeared in the Press-Register on Jan 4, 2009, by Jim Corley concerning global warming. Mr. Corley is correct when he states "This CO2 theory has been shown to be wrong."LiNeBrEaKAl Gore's book titled, "An Inconvenient Truth," shows a graph of atmospheric CO2 levels increasing, and another graph showing atmospheric temperature increasing. What Al Gore purposely fails to point out is that atmospheric temperature increased first, then 100 years later, atmospheric CO2 increased.LiNeBrEaKThe reason for this is that warming of the atmosphere (due to increase solar activity) caused CO2 to evolve from the oceans, thereby increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. As atmospheric temperatures decreased, CO2 was reabsorbed by the oceans, thereby reducing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKIf Al Gore had pointed this out, it would have exposed his fraudulent theory that CO2 causes global warming.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, brain dead politicians and the indoctrinated masses have fallen for Al Gore's scam, and will consequently destroy the U.S. economy by imposing extremely costly, but ineffective carbon cap and trade quotas on coal powered power plants.LiNeBrEaKD.GARRETTLiNeBrEaKDaphneLiNeBrEaKValkyrie is appropriateLiNeBrEaKfor bin Laden's missionLiNeBrEaKIt seems fashionable for terrorists and militants to label America the "Great Satan" and Israel the "Little Satan," when the real origin of the terms rest with Muslims of Islamic faith like Khomeini of Iran and Osama bin Laden of Saudi Arabia.LiNeBrEaKUnless we of the West are in a state of denial, and that includes outgoing and incoming presidents of the United States, the enemy are those who believe in extremist Islam as world arbiter and resist other religious faiths.LiNeBrEaKValkyrie, a Norse myth, code word for those who sought to assassinate Hitler, seems appropriate for bin Laden, whose mission to war with America and the West is well known and "chooser of the slain."LiNeBrEaKTo those who tire of my refrain of militant Islam as enemy and that the "war on terrorism" is a misnomer, vague and nondefinable as a strategy can return to philosopher George Santayana who reminded us that "to forget the lessons of history is to repeat them at our discomfiture."LiNeBrEaKWe almost responded too late to the appetites of Hitler and Stalin. And to those who rationalize Islam or blame us for its anger with us should research and trace "why they hate us" and the essence of their crusade. There is much available. Albert Hourani's "A History of the Arab Peoples" helps.LiNeBrEaKThis is an intellectual trek of a panoramic view of 12 centuries of Arab history and culture. It tells the whole story up to the 1990s when it was published, is scholarly, and a master work, not doctrinaire or revolutionary but perhaps the seeds are there. It reveals the turmoil of Arab nationalism and fundamentalism, Middle Eastern wars, oil crises and the civilization it created: beauty of the mosques, education, Arab science, and internal conflicts to include widespread poverty; the role of women; and the Palestinian question.LiNeBrEaKThe account includes views of theoreticians as Taymiyya: Islam must prevail as only religion, defeat/persecute others; Wahhab: (Saudi ideology) argued for oneness and Islam as its voice; al-Banna: Islam a state and a religion; Sayid Qutb: saw Christianity as evil due to openness and sexual attitudes - and argued to expunge it and Judaism.LiNeBrEaKTo the true-believing Muslim there appears no compromise, a ritual so encompassing, persuasive, ideologically strong and perhaps most significant there is no room for rationalization, change or opportunity to argue its merits, or leave. To leave could lead to ostracism, prison or even death as history reminds. Unlike Judaism, Christianity is where one can disagree, sin, repent and return.LiNeBrEaKBelief here can be strong, yet our culture places it in a perspective of individual selection rather than in the guise of a near fanatical movement.LiNeBrEaKTo paraphrase Eric Hoffer (True Believer) "man is everywhere on the march, both by converting or antagonizing he shapes the world in his own image. To line up with or against him, we must know his nature and potential."LiNeBrEaKDON CARMICHAELLiNeBrEaKLoxley	TAXES and TAXATION (90%); PROPERTY TAX (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); REAL ESTATE APPRAISALS (76%); TAX ASSESSORS (76%)  	AL GORE (81%)  	ALABAMA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (79%)  	January 21, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Mobile Press Register Inc.

LiNeBrEaKWhen it was started last summer, the effort was considered a tall order by the small team of executives and engineers assigned to it. After all, the auto industry can take years to develop vehicles.LiNeBrEaKBut Ford was feeling pressure from competitors, and decided it could not afford to fall behind in the rapidly expanding race to put electric cars in dealer showrooms.LiNeBrEaK"Frankly, I think it's a gamble not to do it," William C. Ford Jr., the company's executive chairman, said in an interview. "It's clear that society is headed down this road."LiNeBrEaKCertainly, Ford and other carmakers are betting billions of dollars on this new direction, at a time when they can ill afford it and when Detroit is facing government scrutiny after the $17. 4 billion bailout of GM and Chrysler.LiNeBrEaKThroughout the cavernous Detroit auto show hall, typically the high temple of brute horsepower, auto companies will be competing this week to establish their green and electric credentials. Today, when the show opens, Ford will announce plans for its electric vehicle, including a goal to start selling them by 2011.LiNeBrEaKThese are risky bets. There are no guarantees that consumers - for all their stated concerns about global warming, dependence on foreign oil and unpredictable gas prices - will buy enough of them. They may balk, for example, at the limits on how far they can drive on a single charge.LiNeBrEaKBut the companies could get some help from President-elect Barack Obama. He has said he is committed to promoting cleaner cars, and may propose incentives to encourage consumers and businesses to buy them.LiNeBrEaKFord plans to make only 10,000 of the electric vehicles a year at first - very few by Detroit standards - to test the market cautiously.LiNeBrEaKStill, Obama's interest, and the scope of projects by Ford and others, is convincing some environmentalists that the industry is serious about electric cars.LiNeBrEaK"I think the days of the gasoline engine are numbered, even if we don't know exactly what that number is," said Daniel Becker, head of the Safe Climate Campaign, which is part of the Center for Auto Safety consumer advocacy group in Washington.

The New York Times 	January 11, 2009 Sunday   Late Edition - Final	28. Star Island, Bahamas Paradise Without Guilt  	Section TR; Column 0; Travel Desk; ECO DESTINATION OF THE YEAR; Pg. 13  	703 words  	A STIFF breeze was roughing up the ocean, and spray shot up into David Sklar's small boat with every bump across a wave. The Bahamian sun beat down through patchy clouds, baking unprotected skin. A quick turn into a protected cove and the wind was  gone, but the big Yamaha outboard still had work to do, idling against a tidal current riffling up the aquamarine sea. LiNeBrEaK  A baby loggerhead turtle swam by, its graceful flippers and foot-wide shell just below the surface in clear water. ''Did you know the turtles can move as fast as birds?'' Mr. Sklar asked. LiNeBrEaK  Trade winds, sun and current  --  Mr. Sklar, 41, a Savannah, Ga., developer, and his partners plan to harness all of them to generate electricity on Star Island (www.starislandbahamas.com), a 35-acre cay near the Bahamian island of Eleuthera. The goal is to turn the island, now home to nothing but sand, coral rock and trees, into the world's first truly carbon-neutral resort island -- uncompromisingly luxurious, but without any reliance on fossil fuels that add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. LiNeBrEaK  Even the turtle, swimming about 30 yards off Star Island, represents an opportunity  --  not for soup or biomass, but as a symbol of the stakes of environmental preservation that Mr. Sklar hopes buyers will find compelling when sales of vacation homes begin early this year. A 68-room hotel is to follow, and some condos will be available for short-term rentals. LiNeBrEaK  This project isn't alone -- Richard Branson and Leonardo DiCaprio are involved in carbon-neutral resort proposals in the Virgin Islands and Belize, and a resort in the Maldives is undergoing a kind of carbon-neutral retrofit. But Star Island is running ahead of the trend. Design (by Mr. Sklar, who has a degree in architecture) and government approvals are complete, and the first building  is expected to go up this year. LiNeBrEaK  The heart of Star Island's carbon neutrality will be a photovoltaic roof and a small wind turbine on every building, generating enough power to supply its own needs and send a surplus to banks of storage batteries. Other green features include wastewater treatment using technology developed for ships by the United States Coast Guard, a lagoon for collecting runoff, and even a rooftop herb garden. Garbage will be converted into fertilizer as well as fuel for extra electrical wattage, some of which may one day power electric boats plugging in at the island dock. LiNeBrEaK  It all sounded a bit fanciful last October, as Mr. Sklar gestured toward a phantom reception center, bungalows and hotel while standing on a ridge of barren rock (cabbage farmers cleared Star Island's native vegetation long ago; on many maps, it still appears as Cabbage Cay). But with travelers uneasy about contributing to climate change while they play, the market for a guilt-free vacation appears ready to tap. LiNeBrEaK  The dream of a carbon-neutral Bali Hai also captivated Richard Branson, who bought Mosquito Island, a speck of land off Virgin Gorda, with plans to develop ''a showcase for sustainability and eco-living,'' according to a statement from his Virgin Elite resort group. For now, the project is still ''very much in the planning and development stages,'' a spokeswoman said. The idea also captured the attention of Leonardo DiCaprio. Or rather, his purchase of Blackadore Caye in Belize a few years ago captured the public's attention, with a flurry of news reports about his plans to build a carbon-free vacation spot. But ''nothing has progressed on this for some time,'' said his publicist, Ken Sunshine. LiNeBrEaK  Across the world in the Maldives, Six Senses Resorts and Spas is adapting its plush Soneva Fushi resort to go carbon-neutral by 2010. Among other things, it is adding solar-powered steam turbines that will power everything from the air-conditioning to a desalination plant.LiNeBrEaK  Neither Soneva Fushi nor Star Island pretends to be inventing anything new, although both hope other builders will use their ideas as prototypes. LiNeBrEaK  ''I use the analogy of the Prius,'' said Scott Sklar (no relation to David Sklar), a Washington environmental consultant who is advising Star Island. ''An elegant integration of technology that was out there  --  made seamless and very user-friendly.''

LiNeBrEaK  It's a good idea to fix the potholes, but let's put the real money into the railroad.LiNeBrEaK  Bob Faber    Ann Arbor, Mich., Jan. 5, 2009LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Your editorial mentions controlling climate change and dependence on foreign oil as primary motivation for financing mass transit.LiNeBrEaK  However, 9 percent of households (more than 26 million people) in the United States do not have a vehicle, while others cannot afford to drive the cars they own. For many, public transportation is absolutely necessary to collect a paycheck, get an education or receive medical care.LiNeBrEaK  In one study, single mothers cited transportation as the most frequent obstacle to obtaining health care after cost and insurance difficulties.LiNeBrEaK  The needs of these Americans must not be forgotten by the Obama administration or Congress.LiNeBrEaK  Kevin Miller    Washington, Jan. 5, 2009LiNeBrEaK  The writer is a research associate at the Institute for Women's Policy Research.LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor: LiNeBrEaK  For the last 20 years, I lived in or within an hour's drive from Madrid. During that time, I saw an awkward, often undependable commuter bus system grow into hourly and half-hourly service that attempts to relieve expanded roadways that never keep up with the huge glut of traffic. Spaniards have their own love affair with the car and the ''joys'' of suburban living. LiNeBrEaK  Taking a cue from patient local city councils in this small agricultural town, we, too, could bring back new, improved, American-made buses and adding jitneys for short runs.LiNeBrEaK  Filling buses here will take time, too. But while we wait and breathe new life into a sagging American-operated industry, we could look for help from gas taxes.LiNeBrEaK  Antonia Hyde     Carlisle, Pa., Jan. 5, 2009LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  You rightly point President-elect Barack Obama toward an investment in clean air, green jobs and less dependency on oil. But there's more: mass transit will protect the public's health. LiNeBrEaK  Besides the obvious benefits of a cleaner environment with fewer toxins and greenhouse gases, mass transit means people will walk and bike more. We can also expect fewer injuries and deaths from car crashes. And the jobs that would be created also benefit the public's health; steady employment means steady income, and for many, health care coverage.LiNeBrEaK  Public transit is indeed the multiplier effect we've been waiting for: a good solution that solves multiple problems.LiNeBrEaK  Larry Cohen     Executive Director     Prevention Institute     Oakland, Calif., Jan. 5, 2009LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  I can think of no transit project more needed or more symbolically potent than the mass-transit line recently approved by Michigan's Legislature for the city of Detroit.LiNeBrEaK  This proposal is the first step in a long-term vision that connects the impoverished urban core of Detroit with the much wealthier suburbs, stretching all the way to Ann Arbor.LiNeBrEaK  It would provide easy, affordable transportation in and out of the city and stimulate economic growth. It would also demonstrate to our automakers that motors appear in conveyances other than cars. Perhaps most important, it would be a tangible step toward healing the literal and figurative divisions created as a result of the riots of the 1960s and subsequent ''white flight.''LiNeBrEaK  Dane A.

The New York Times 	January 11, 2009 Sunday  Correction Appended  	Detroit Goes for Gasless Cars, but Will Drivers?  	Section A; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1  	1291 words  	Late Edition - FinalLiNeBrEaKInside the Ford Motor Company, it was called Project M -- to build a prototype of a totally electric, battery-powered car in just six months.LiNeBrEaK  When it was started last summer, the effort was considered a tall order by the small team of executives and engineers assigned to it. After all, the auto industry can take years to develop vehicles.LiNeBrEaKBut Ford was feeling pressure from competitors, and decided it could not afford to fall behind in the rapidly expanding race to put electric cars in dealer showrooms. LiNeBrEaK  ''Frankly, I think it's a gamble not to do it,'' William C. Ford Jr., the company's executive chairman, said in an interview. ''It's clear that society is headed down this road.'' LiNeBrEaK  Certainly, Ford and other carmakers are betting billions of dollars on this new direction, at a time when they can ill afford it and when Detroit is facing government scrutiny after the $17. 4 billion bailout of G.M. and Chrysler. LiNeBrEaK  Throughout the cavernous Detroit auto show hall, typically the high temple of brute horsepower, auto companies will be competing this week to establish their green and electric credentials. On Sunday, when the show opens, Ford will announce plans for its electric vehicle, including a goal to start selling them by 2011.LiNeBrEaK  These are risky bets. There are no guarantees that consumers -- for all their stated concerns about global warming, dependence on foreign oil and unpredictable gas prices -- will buy enough of them. They may balk, for example, at the limits on how far they can drive on a single charge.LiNeBrEaK  But the companies could get some help from President-elect Barack Obama. He has said he is committed to promoting cleaner cars, and may propose incentives to encourage consumers and businesses to buy them.LiNeBrEaK  Ford plans to make only 10,000 of the electric vehicles a year at first -- very few by Detroit standards -- to test the market cautiously.LiNeBrEaK  Still, Mr. Obama's interest, and the scope of projects by Ford and others, is convincing some environmentalists that the industry is serious about electric cars. LiNeBrEaK  ''I think the days of the gasoline engine are numbered, even if we don't know exactly what that number is,'' said Daniel Becker, head of the Safe Climate Campaign, which is part of the Center for Auto Safety consumer advocacy group in Washington.LiNeBrEaK  The competition over electrics is picking up speed and players. Toyota, which has so far focused its efforts on hybrid models, will display a battery-powered concept car at the Detroit show. Nissan's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, has promised to sell an electric car in the United States and Japan as early as next year.LiNeBrEaK  Two Japanese automakers, Mitsubishi and Fuji Heavy Industries, the parent company of Subaru, are also testing electric cars. And Chrysler, the most troubled of Detroit's three auto companies, has vowed to produce its first electric car by 2010.LiNeBrEaK  The surge toward electric vehicles also appears to be jump-starting investments in advanced-battery production in the United States. General Motors will announce plans at the auto show to build a factory in the United States to assemble advanced batteries for its Chevrolet Volt model, which it expects to start selling next year. LiNeBrEaK  American auto executives have warned that without homegrown suppliers, the country could potentially become as dependent on Asian-made batteries as it is on oil from the Middle East and elsewhere. LiNeBrEaK  ''Automakers cannot afford the batteries until they are produced in a certain volume,'' said Brett Smith, an industry analyst at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''But they can't be produced in volume until companies make a big manufacturing investment.''LiNeBrEaK  Strong consumer demand has to be part of that equation, too. And it remains unclear whether consumers will be comfortable with the idea of buying an electric car, or whether these vehicles will priced to compete with comparable gas-powered models. LiNeBrEaK  Ford would not say what its electric car will cost. The Chevrolet Volt is expected to cost around $40,000.LiNeBrEaK  ''It's the right time to take this step, but it would be presumptive to try and predict what the market is ultimately going to look like,'' said Derrick M. Kuzak, Ford's chief of global product development.LiNeBrEaK  So far, consumers have proved to be fickle about how much they care about fuel economy. When gas prices soared above $4 a gallon last year, sales of the market-leading Prius hybrid surged so quickly that Toyota could not build them fast enough. But demand sagged when gas prices dropped below $2 a gallon.LiNeBrEaK  Industry analysts also note that electric models could be a harder sell than hybrids, which have a gasoline engine to assist and recharge battery packs, freeing them from the need to be plugged in.LiNeBrEaK  Most of the prospective electric models need to be charged for several hours to cover a day's worth of driving. Ford estimates that its car will need at least a six-hour charge to travel 100 miles. The Volt can get 40 miles on battery power alone, and it has a small gasoline engine that drives a generator to extend its range.LiNeBrEaK  Americans, on average, drive their cars less than 35 miles a day, according to the latest federal statistics, and the industry is likely to play up that fact in its advertising campaigns. With so many families owning two cars, they may see an electric vehicle as an attractive choice for short commutes and running errands.LiNeBrEaK  One way to potentially take the worry out of being stuck with a spent battery is to allow consumers to change them on the fly. The firm Better Place, of Palo Alto, Calif., is working with Nissan and other carmakers to set up stations to offer quick battery exchanges or plug-in charging outlets in Japan, Israel, Denmark and elsewhere. The company has also signed partnership deals in Hawaii and California.LiNeBrEaK  ''What will determine the market is not going to be how far your battery can go, but how far your infrastructure is spread so power is available,'' said Shai Agassi, the chief executive of Better Place.LiNeBrEaK  The American auto industry's most notable previous foray into electric vehicles came in the late 1990s, when G.M. introduced the EV-1. That car, which was available in limited numbers only through leases, was pulled from production before it could build a following (though a 2006 documentary about the EV-1 -- ''Who Killed the Electric Car?'' -- has developed a following of its own). LiNeBrEaK  Now most of the major car companies have years of experience with hybrid vehicles and their electric systems. While Ford's Project M was started last year, executives said the company had been moving in this direction since early this decade. Ford first started selling its Escape hybrid S.U.V. in 2004.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Ford recalled how he used to drive an experimental electric Ranger pickup truck to work each day. ''The reason we used a Ranger was because the whole back bed was full of lead-acid batteries,'' he said.LiNeBrEaK  The advent of smaller, more advanced lithium-ion batteries has also allowed the car companies to develop electric cars that look, feel and handle much like conventional vehicles.LiNeBrEaK  Ford and its supplier partner, the Canadian firm Magna International, built the Project M prototype in the body of a Ford Focus compact car. It is planning a more distinctive design for the finished product when it goes on the market in two years.LiNeBrEaK  The modest expectations for initial sales are reflected in Ford's plan for introducing the car at the auto show Sunday. There won't be the usual dry ice, flashing lights and pounding music.LiNeBrEaK  Instead, there will be a simple announcement at a news conference, and the car will be parked on the street in front of the convention center, available for short test drives by journalists through downtown Detroit.

Newsday (Melville, New York)  	January 11, 2009 Sunday 	LI sees new interest in waste-to-energy plants  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1134 words  	Jan. 11--Burning garbage might seem as outmoded as stirrup pants and big hair -- both in vogue when Long Island's four municipal incinerators were built.LiNeBrEaKBut rising fuel costs and other shifts have stirred new local interest in waste-to-energy plants, those towering burners that reduce tons of trash to heaps of ash, creating a bit of electricity along the way.LiNeBrEaKCovanta Energy Corp. wants to expand capacity by 43 percent at its flagship Westbury plant, the largest on Long Island, which is on land leased from the Town of Hempstead. The Town of Islip plans to more than double the amount of trash burned at its Ronkonkoma incinerator at MacArthur Airport. That would allow it to take garbage from Brookhaven and generate enough energy for 18,000 homes by 2015. LiNeBrEaKIf approved, the plans would increase local incinerator capacity by 36. 5 percent and would allow an additional 642,975 tons of trash annually to be burned on Long Island instead of buried in distant landfills.LiNeBrEaKThe relative lack of controversy surrounding the incinerators' proposed expansions contrasts sharply with the atmosphere when they were first built about 20 years ago. Some saw incinerators as the answer to Long Island's trash disposal crisis after most local landfills closed, a plight dramatized by the 1987 odyssey of a barge loaded with Islip trash that could not find a place to unload. But critics said municipalities were rushing into expensive projects whose technology was unproven; others feared pollution from smokestacks and incinerator ash, concerns that have been tempered by advances in smokestack technology.LiNeBrEaKSupporters say expanding capacity would save towns money on garbage disposal and help the environment, because fuel-guzzling garbage trucks would be making shorter trips.LiNeBrEaK"We believe the best thing is for Long Island to solve its waste problems locally," said John Waffenschmidt, Covanta's vice president of environmental science and community affairs. "It is the environmentally wrong thing to do to long-haul it off the Island. We are banking on the fact that there will be more recognition of the importance of moving away from fossil fuels."LiNeBrEaKCuts greenhouse gases, backers claimLiNeBrEaKThe renewed local interest reflects a broader push by the waste-to-energy industry and some academics to recast trash combustion as a "green" disposal strategy. Proponents say it produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions than landfilling and generates valuable energy from materials that would otherwise end up in the ground.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, Long Island's four local incinerators produced about 4 percent of the 22. 7 million megawatt hours consumed here, according to the Long Island Power Authority. That contribution would not much change even if the incinerator expansions go forward, spokesman Ed Dumas said.LiNeBrEaKSome environmental advocates say waste-to-energy plants are problematic because they burn up materials that could be recycled. And pollution is still a concern, despite improved technology that has reduced toxic emissions of mercury and dioxin. Burning garbage also produces ash that contains heavy metals and must be disposed of in special lined ash fills like those maintained by the towns of Brookhaven and Babylon. Burning reduces a load of garbage to about one-tenth its size in ash.LiNeBrEaKExpanding incinerators is the wrong approach to Long Island's garbage dilemma, said Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Instead, he said municipalities should focus on whittling the overall waste stream through aggressive recycling and composting.LiNeBrEaK"Waste-to-energy plants emit about as much greenhouse gases as oil-fueled power plants," Hershkowitz said.LiNeBrEaKWaffenschmidt said the comparison was inapt because the primary function of Covanta's incinerators is waste disposal, not energy production.LiNeBrEaKMore incinerators than other regionsLiNeBrEaKWith plenty of trash and no active municipal garbage dumps -- the result of a 1983 law intended to prevent pollution of public drinking water -- Long Island already has more incinerators than any other region in the state. But plans to build more stalled in the 1990s amid criticism over cost and pollution. At the same time, hauling garbage away turned out to be more affordable than previously believed, thanks to cheap fuel for trucks and trains and competitive tipping fees at out-of-state landfills.LiNeBrEaK"So long as costs were reasonable, people didn't mind what happened to the garbage," said David Tonjes, an assistant professor at Stony Brook University who studies waste disposal. "Although we had identified landfilling as something that could cause environmental harm, it was OK for that to happen to other people," he said.LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, about 43 percent of Long Island's garbage went to incinerators, according to a survey Tonjes did of municipal solid waste disposal in Nassau and Suffolk. Another 30 percent was shipped off-Island and 27 percent was recycled.LiNeBrEaKNationwide, less than 13 percent of municipal trash went to waste-to-energy plants in 2007, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency.LiNeBrEaKAvoiding rise and fall in petroleum pricesLiNeBrEaKThe proposals to expand the Westbury and Islip waste-to-energy plants come as many Long Island towns are negotiating long-term garbage contracts that will affect residential garbage rates and probably redraw where the region sends its trash. Among the considerations: whether the price stability an incinerator agreement offers will make more sense in the long run than disposal contracts with haulers, where prices often rise and fall with the price of petroleum.LiNeBrEaKConcerns about climate change may also be driving the interest in incinerators, said Lawrence Swanson, director of Stony Brook's Waste Reduction and Management Institute.LiNeBrEaK"If you look at total emissions, waste-to-energy comes out to be much cleaner than driving trucks on and off the island," Swanson said. "If you looked at the science, you'd be very favorably impressed."LiNeBrEaKWith additional reporting by staff writers EDEN LAIKIN, JENNIFER MALONEY and PATRICK WHITTLELiNeBrEaKWhat happens to LI's garbageLiNeBrEaKLong Island produces an estimated 3. 5 million tons of garbage each year.

Newsday (Melville, New York)  	January 11, 2009 Sunday 	Incinerator emissions cleaner than in past  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	360 words  	Jan. 11--Ever wondered what exactly comes out of incinerator smokestacks?LiNeBrEaKA light dusting of mercury, lead and dioxin -- mixed with much larger quantities of common air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, or NOx. LiNeBrEaKStill, trash combustion has come a long way since the early 1980s. Tests then showed an incinerator in Westbury that predated the current facility had emitted dangerous levels of the carcinogen dioxin.LiNeBrEaKSmokestack emissions dropped in the 1990s because of improved pollution controls and stricter federal regulations. Modern incinerators control burn temperatures to limit formation of mercury and dioxin, said Lawrence Swanson of Stony Brook University's Waste Reduction and Management Institute.LiNeBrEaKBut waste-to-energy plants still produce plenty of pollutants. In 2007 state environmental records show the Covanta Energy Corp. plant in Westbury on Town of Hempstead land emitted 2. 46 million pounds of NOx, 496,000 pounds of carbon dioxide and 357,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide. All three pollutants are regulated by the federal Environmental Protection Agency because they can cause respiratory ailments and contribute to acid rain or climate change.LiNeBrEaKCovanta Hempstead is "well within" federal and state emissions standards, state Department of Environmental Conservation spokeswoman Lori Severino said Friday.LiNeBrEaKBut some have challenged the federal standards, saying the EPA improperly calculated the "floors," or baselines for the minimum levels of emissions controls incinerators must meet.LiNeBrEaKThe agency is now reviewing the matter, but current regulations remain in place, said EPA spokeswoman Cathy Milbourn. "If we determine that the floor levels should be changed, we'll have to propose additional amendments," she said.

Newsday (Melville, New York)  	January 11, 2009 Sunday 	Experts say Long Island should brace for cold January  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	551 words  	Jan. 11--It's been more snowy than typical this winter on Long Island, although totals are likely to end up closer to annual averages than they have in the past few years, experts said yesterday. LiNeBrEaKBut bundle up, because after a December of fluctuating temperatures, forecasters predict one of the most bitterly cold Januaries in recent memory.LiNeBrEaKIslip, for example, has already seen more than 10 inches of snow this season, which is relatively uncommon because greater snowfall usually comes later, experts said. The average December snowfall on Long Island is about 3 inches, weather officials said.LiNeBrEaKBecause it's surrounded by ocean, it's not uncommon for snow levels on Long Island to vary greatly, experts said.LiNeBrEaK"We have seen a more active storm track this winter," said Andy Snyder, a staff meteorologist at Weather Central in Madison, Wis., citing systems that cut from the Midwest to the Northeast, such as the storm that brought snow to Long Island yesterday.LiNeBrEaKBut because Long Island usually averages about 20 to 30 inches of snow each winter, the season is on track to be more typical than last year, which saw only 8. 8 inches between Dec. 20 and March 20, according to Accu-Weather.LiNeBrEaK"It's a normal winter," said Victor Cassella, a meteorologist in Port Jefferson Station. "This is what you should expect."LiNeBrEaKBut that could change this week when temperatures are expected to turn even more bitter, dropping to as low as 9 degrees on Wednesday. An arctic blast of low pressure is expected to move south from Canada, Snyder said. The frigid weather might linger.LiNeBrEaK"The rest of this month looks extremely cold," Snyder said, "colder than anything we've seen in the last several winters and, in some cases [in the Northeast], in the last 10 years."LiNeBrEaKLong-term precipitation is tougher to predict, though the National Weather Service estimates that it will be normal this month, Snyder said. For next month and into the spring, he said, the service is predicting average temperatures and precipitation levels.LiNeBrEaKThe warming effects of La Nina left Long Island with relatively low levels of snow over the past few years, experts said. But this season, thanks to big temperature swings, snowfall has been more frequent.LiNeBrEaKThough December temperatures averaged about the typical 36 degrees, they included several days of extreme highs and lows, Snyder said. For example, on Dec. 8, a record low temperature was set in Islip at 18 degrees. Just four days later, on Dec. 12, Islip had another record -- 60 degrees.LiNeBrEaKSuch fluctuations are created by active winter storm systems that bring unseasonable warmth followed by colder air, Snyder said. Those extremes also lead to greater precipitation.LiNeBrEaKRecent temperatures have been ideal for snowfall, said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster at the National Weather Service in Maryland. Very cold weather often means the air is too dry to produce precipitation. When it's too warm, rain replaces snow.

The Orange Leader (Texas)  	January 11, 2009 Sunday 	Warmer weather patterns predicted  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	513 words  	Jan. 11--For weather changes, Southeast Texans only need to wait a few minutes since the temperatures are known to fluctuate without notice.LiNeBrEaKHowever, people seeking a trend of warmer weather in the next few months are in luck. The average temperature for January and February are usually highs in the 60s and lows in the 40s. However, this year there may be some occasions when the temperatures may reach into the 70s. LiNeBrEaKAs March rolls around temperatures are expected to remain in the lower 70s. The last spring frost is expected by March 16. However, this is Southeast Texas and in the past there have been reports of more than just a little frost on the ground way into April, according to Montra Lockwood, meteorologist for the National Weather Service.LiNeBrEaKMarch through June is expected to be normal with April temperatures averaging in the upper 70s, May reaching highs in the mid 80s and by June it will be in the lower 90s, Lockwood said.LiNeBrEaKAs the year continues through the summer months, the temperatures are expected to climb. This summer may be a "real scorcher."LiNeBrEaK"The fall months of September through November still show the potential for above normal temperatures," Lockwood said.LiNeBrEaKBy then Southeast Texans will be anxiously anticipating winter months, which will to be cooler, but still above average.LiNeBrEaKFor forecasters watching weather patterns can be an unpredictable science.LiNeBrEaKWith the absence of La Nina and El Nino climate patterns in the equatorial Pacific Ocean this season, predicting weather patterns on seasonal timescales becomes increasingly challenging. Instead, other climate patterns over the Arctic and North Atlantic regions may play a significant role in influencing U.S. weather, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.LiNeBrEaKEl Nino is considered the second biggest climate-related influence on human activities, after the natural flow of the seasons. Although the phenomenon is at least thousands of years old, its impacts on global climate have only recently been recognized.LiNeBrEaKEl Nino is a warming of the ocean surface off the western coast of South America that occurs every 4-12 years when upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water does not occur. It causes die-offs of plankton and fish and affects Pacific jet stream winds, altering storm tracks and creating unusual weather patterns in various parts of the world, according to NOAALiNeBrEaKLa Nina is a state of unusually cool sea surface temperatures in the western Pacific, which are associated with lowered precipitation in the southern US and western South America, but an increase in the frequency of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic, and heavier rainfall in Indonesia and Australia.

Palm Beach Post (Florida) 	January 11, 2009 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	LAWMAKER VOWS TO SHEPHERD EVERGLADES MONEY  	A SECTION; Pg. 15A  	355 words  	Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz pledged to make jump-starting Washington's floundering commitment to restore the Everglades her "personal responsibility" as she takes hold of Congressional purse strings for the second year in a row. LiNeBrEaKWasserman-Schultz, D-Weston, whom House leaders tapped to return to her post as House Appropriations subcommittee chairwoman, called for ending the "cycle of delay" that has bogged down the $11 billion Everglades restoration plan that the state and federal government committed to in 2000.LiNeBrEaK"Make no mistake, more funding is needed and quickly, because delay is not an option," Wasserman-Schultz said in a speech Saturday at the Everglades Coalition's annual conference.LiNeBrEaK"I will not rest until we win," she said.LiNeBrEaKThe speech added to the jubilant mood among Everglades advocates at the conference, who see President-elect Obama's incoming administration, Democratic gains in Congress and the promise of a federal economic stimulus package as boons to the Everglades.LiNeBrEaKConference attendees also are cheering Obama's appointment of Carol Browner, a Miami native and Environmental Protection Agency head in the Clinton administration, as assistant to the president for energy and climate change.LiNeBrEaKGov. Charlie Crist received an award from the coalition on Friday for leading the $1. 34billion state buyout of 180,000 acres of U.S. Sugar Corp. farmland to be used to restore flows from Lake Okeechobee south through the ecosystem.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists cheer the buyout, set to close in September, as a landmark step forward in returning the Everglades to something resembling its natural state, even as critics have derided it as a bailout to a sugar giant suffering from slumping profits and massive debt.LiNeBrEaKStill, the buyout seemed a signal of the Everglades' changing fortunes and shifted environmentalists' perceptions of U.S. Sugar from spoiler to partner in Everglades restoration.LiNeBrEaKWasserman-Schultz marveled at the turnaround.LiNeBrEaK"Today we have an opportunity to purchase 181,000 acres for Everglades restoration -- and they're willing to sell it to us," she said.

F02  	399 words  	It's fear and ignorance It was with personal appreciation that I read the As I See It column by Wayne Winters, "Bigotry shouldn't silence loving vows" (Jan. 4). LiNeBrEaKThirty two years ago, the announcement was made that I was to be married. This announcement was met by some in my church with disapproval. My soon-to-be-husband was of another race. Opinions were voiced similar to those cited in the Virginia state law of 1959.LiNeBrEaKToday the hot topic is homosexuality. Does one's sexual orientation define who a person is? Gender, skin color or sexual orientation do not begin to encompass the entire person.LiNeBrEaKAs a follower of Jesus, I feel a sadness beyond compare when fear, ignorance and even hate are expressed in Jesus' name. His message of love and reconciliation is extended to all.LiNeBrEaKWENDY NGUYEN Swatara Twp.LiNeBrEaKFor nondiscriminationLiNeBrEaKThank you to Wayne Winters for his lucid and loving exposition of the case for marriage equality (As I See It, Jan. 4). Marriage is the civil contract which our society has identified as the way we want couples to legally declare their commitment to each other. There is no rational basis for then denying same-sex couples the opportunity to enter into this contract. As we have with other fundamental civil rights, we need to affirm nondiscrimination.LiNeBrEaKTERRY O'H. STARK HarrisburgLiNeBrEaKHe spoke for meLiNeBrEaKThank you! Thank you! Mr. Winters for your As I See It column "Bigotry shouldn't silence loving vows" (Jan. 4). I, too, have a gay son and on many occasions wanted to write a letter to the editor but felt I could never express myself as eloquently as you did, and now you have done it for me. Again THANK YOU.LiNeBrEaKGLADYS KLEIN Hampden Twp.LiNeBrEaKLiberal flaws exposedLiNeBrEaKI've just finished reading Laura Ingraham's book Power to the People. I recommend it for all to read. I'm very impressed how Laura exposes liberals' flaws with such accuracy.LiNeBrEaKThere are three topics in the book that I find very disturbing: 1. Al Gore's apocalyptic preaching, creating fear and anxiety over a great hoax known as global warming. 2. The elite in academia brainwashing our youth with their liberal agenda. 3. Our culture's sickening obsession with Hollywood.LiNeBrEaKI'm interested to see how the far left zealots will dispute these facts.LiNeBrEaKIn conclusion, I think we need to embrace the truth, which Power to the People provides, rather than buy into the far left's delusional fantasy of change.LiNeBrEaKNATHANIEL STROUP Wiconisco Twp.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	January 11, 2009 Sunday   TWO STAR EDITION	Fish Commission survey part of next five-year plan  	OUTDOORS; OUTDOORS NOTEBOOK; Pg. D-11  	564 words  	The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission partners well with other agencies and organizations and offers diverse recreational opportunities and satisfactory fish stocking programs, but its small workforce is stretched too thin, internal communication and funding are problematic, and a lot of the agency's equipment and facilities are outdated.LiNeBrEaKThose are among the preliminary results of a Strategic Planning Individual Input Survey that has been posted on the agency's Web site since mid-December. LiNeBrEaKThe questionnaire, which completed its task and was to be pulled from the site yesterday, asked agency employees, commissioners and outdoors recreationists to document opinions on a wide range of issues.LiNeBrEaKThe survey covered the PFBC's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats, legislative issues, resource management, organizational efficiency, staffing, vision for the next five years and core values.LiNeBrEaKProject coordinator Laurel Anders said about 200 responses had been logged before Christmas. The final results will be collated, analyzed and included during the formation of the agency's next five-year strategic plan.LiNeBrEaK"A lot of things have changed since the formation of our last strategic plan," she said. "Access [for anglers and boaters] has risen to the top of the heap in the last few years. The impact of invasive species is a much larger concern than it was, climate change whatever its causes, the economy and the fact that fewer people are fishing and boating -- a whole generation of youth specifically. And we have a new director who sort of inherited our last strategic plan. This is the first time he'll be involved in the full planning process."LiNeBrEaKAnders said details of the new plan will be unveiled as they develop.LiNeBrEaKDoe tagsLiNeBrEaKDespite the serious problem of access to huntable lands in Allegheny County, local hunters have stepped up to the plate this season to help solve the related problem of urban and suburban deer overpopulation. Of the 68,000 antlerless tags allocated in Wildlife Management Unit 2B, a little over 59,000 have been sold so far, a noticeable increase over the 2007-2008 season. Nearly 9,000 tags are left, and does remain fair game through Jan. 24 in 2B, which includes all of Allegheny and parts of Westmoreland, Fayette, Washington, Beaver and Butler counties. It's too soon to tell how many of those well-intentioned purchases have paid off.LiNeBrEaKOf fish and fliesLiNeBrEaKAt tomorrow's monthly members meeting of Penn's Woods West Trout Unlimited, trout experts Bob Heil and Joe Lantz will present a fly-fishing program about streams in Southwestern Pennsylvania and demonstrate tying techniques for trout, bass and steelhead. Tomorrow's also the date of PWWTU's annual Great Fly Sale. Patterns tied and donated by TU members sell for $5 per half dozen and help finance the group's good work. The meeting is free and open to the public and starts at 7 p.m. at the Brentwood VFW Post 1810, 3801 Clairton Blvd. (Rt. 51).

Sacramento Bee (California)  	January 11, 2009 Sunday 	The Sacramento Bee, Calif., Dan Walters column: Dan Walters: California may have a dim future  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	572 words  	Jan. 11--Defense spending in the 1980s, high-tech startups in the 1990s and housing-fueled consumer spending in the 1990s -- all were California economic bubbles that burst spectacularly, leaving recession and government deficits in their wake.LiNeBrEaKWhat, if anything, will come next to pull us out of recession and return California to prosperity? Some think it will be biotechnology, services to baby boomer retirees or solving global warming. LiNeBrEaKLurking in the background, however, is a nagging worry that there won't be anything, that the state's endemically high costs, political dysfunction and long list of unresolved dilemmas, from transportation to water to education, have made us uncompetitive in a global economy. Just last week, a new federal survey found that California has the nation's highest adult illiteracy rate.LiNeBrEaKWe have tended to take the future for granted. No matter how moribund the economy may be at the moment, we think, we have the weather, the entrepreneurial spirit and the strategic location to regroup and prosper.LiNeBrEaKWe may have. But then again, maybe we aren't so special. Maybe we're not immune to the societal afflictions that have beset other states. Maybe we are a rust-belt-to-be on the left coast, a Michigan with winter sunshine.LiNeBrEaKA clue to potential decline may be found in what had been one of the state's stellar sectors in recent years, international trade. California's airports and seaports, especially the latter, became the portal for rapidly expanding trade with Asia. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach became the nation's busiest with Oakland just a few notches down the list.LiNeBrEaKAt its high point, a quarter of the nation's international cargo, imports and exports, was passing through California, including 40 percent of container traffic, despite high costs, traffic congestion and relatively inefficient cargo-handling systems.LiNeBrEaKThe global recession cut into that traffic sharply, as one might expect, but California port officials are forecasting big increases when the economy improves and are planning expensive facility upgrades.LiNeBrEaK"The forecasts are hogwash," says Jack O'Connell, an international trade expert with the University of California. He doubts whether consumer demand for Asian goods will return to former levels because of new wariness about personal debt, and he believes that competition will compel shippers to seek cheaper avenues.LiNeBrEaKLast fall, as Californians were waiting to vote for a new president and fill other offices, an election was held several thousand miles to the south, in Panama. Panamanians approved a multibillion-dollar expansion of the Panama Canal that by the middle of the next decade will allow the biggest container ships -- those that have been forced to offload in California -- to sail all the way to American ports on the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean.LiNeBrEaKWhat has been an economic strength for California, in other words, may join a growing list of weaknesses.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Dan Walters, (916) 321-1195.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	January 11, 2009 Sunday 	Bush's blue legacy;  Ocean monuments may breathe new life into our waters 	OPINION; Pg. F-2  	366 words  	San Diegans care about their ocean. It represents a source of recreation and a livelihood for many, and it is just plain awesome to live near it or to watch the beautiful sunsets over its horizon. LiNeBrEaKBut our ocean and all the others that cover 71 percent of our planet are facing tremendous challenges. There is overfishing, pollution and global warming, which is causing ocean acidification, rising sea levels, shifts in ocean circulation and harming marine wildlife. The oceans absorb almost half of the carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, emitted by human activities. That adversely affects marine life.LiNeBrEaKTo help reverse some of the harmful trends, scientists have long studied remote ocean environments such as those in the western Pacific. Last week, to the delight of scientists and the environmental community, President Bush made history by designating three areas as marine national monuments . As such, these vast areas -- about 195,274 square miles, or an area about the size of California -- will be protected from commercial fishing, oil exploration and destruction or extraction of any natural resources.LiNeBrEaKThe three areas in the designation are:LiNeBrEaK* The Marianas Trench Marine National Monument, which represents some of the westernmost territory of the United States, some 5,600 miles from California. It also contains the Marianas Trench, the deepest place on Earth.LiNeBrEaK* The Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monuments, which contain Kingman Reef, Palmyra Atoll and Wake Island.LiNeBrEaK* The Rose Atoll Marine National Monument, which contains the ecosystems around a remote part of American Samoa.LiNeBrEaKThese areas contain pristine coral reefs, atolls, underwater mountain ranges, rare species of marine life, including tropicbirds, terns, albatrosses, giant clams and reef sharks. By protecting these natural wonders, scientists can study the ocean in its least damaged state and hopefully help restore waters on other parts of the Earth.LiNeBrEaKBush designated the first marine national monument, the Northwest Hawaiian Islands, in 2006 under the Antiquities Act of 1906, which allows presidents to protect public lands by executive order. Hopefully, President Barack Obama will extend on this blue legacy.

B7  	1506 words  	Three hundred and thirty days, plus a final frantic two weeks: not very long, really, to put together the most complex and vital agreement the world has ever seen. But that's all the time there is: In 330 days from now, on Dec. 7, the United Nations Climate Conference will open in Copenhagen and the world community will try to agree a solution to the gravest threat it has ever faced: global warming.LiNeBrEaKBetween 10,000 and 15,000 officials, advisers, diplomats, campaigners and media personnel from nearly 200 countries, almost certainly joined by limousine-loads of heads of state and government from the United States' President Barack Obama down, are expected to meet in the Danish capital in one of the most significant gatherings in history. LiNeBrEaKIf that sounds like exaggeration, we need only glance at some historical comparisons. The Copenhagen meeting will have a far broader reach and potential impact on the world than the Congress of Vienna, say, the 1814-1815 assembly that attempted to reorder Europe after the Napoleonic wars, or the Paris peace conference of 1919, which tried to construct a new global order after World War I, or the 1945 meetings at Yalta and Potsdam that tried to do the same after World War II. For they were all dealing with national boundaries, politics and political structures, phenomena that, of course, are vital in human terms, but ephemeral and changeable. Copenhagen will be dealing with something fundamental to life on Earth: the stability of the biosphere.LiNeBrEaKKnown officially in U.N.-speak as COP 15 - the 15th meeting of the parties of the U.N.'s Framework Convention on Climate Change - the meeting in Denmark will try to work out a way for the world to act together to preserve the thin envelope of atmosphere, soil and sea that surrounds our planet and enables us to live, in the face of rising temperatures that threaten to destroy its habitability.LiNeBrEaKAll the world's major governments, including the once-skeptical administration of the U.S. President George W. Bush, now formally accept that temperature rises have already begun, are likely if unchecked to prove disastrous for human civilization, and are being caused by emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide from our power plants, factories and cars.LiNeBrEaKBut if all the major governments now accept it, getting them to agree on how to tackle it still seems a very long way off indeed. The essential problem, to use the jargon, is burden sharing. We know the world has to cut its CO(-2) emissions drastically, and soon. But which countries are to cut them, by how much?LiNeBrEaKThe Chinese, with their scarcely believable economy growing at 10 percent a year, have now overtaken the Americans as the biggest carbon emitters; but historically, America has emitted far more; and on a per capita basis, U.S. emissions still dwarf those of China. So the Chinese have felt (so far) that they have a moral right for their economy to grow unchecked, and their carbon emissions to grow with it; but many Americans have felt (so far) that they see no reason to act unilaterally to cut their own CO(-2) if the Chinese are not willing to do the same.LiNeBrEaKDifferences like those stubbornly percolate the whole negotiating process and make achieving a universal agreement mind-bogglingly hard. "This is the most complicated deal the world has ever tried to put together," says Tom Burke, visiting professor at Imperial College in England. "In effect, you're asking nearly 200 countries to align their energy policies - to create a common world energy policy. If you look at how hard it has been for the member states of the European Union to align their energy policies, you get an idea of the difficulty of attempting it with the whole world."LiNeBrEaKYet it has to be done, and the penalty for failure could not be higher. It is just 20 years since the world woke up to the danger of rising carbon emissions destabilizing the atmosphere. Two decades ago it seemed a fairly distant threat, prefigured principally in supercomputer climate prediction programs; something that was likely to happen a comfortably long distance away, such as at the end of the 21st century.LiNeBrEaKThree things have altered since then. First, the changing climate is now visible, not just in computer predictions, but all around us: Spring in southern Britain is arriving about three weeks earlier than it did 40 years ago. At this time last year a red admiral butterfly, an archetypal creature of the summer, was photographed perching on a snowdrop, a flower of the winter - a previously unheard-of occurrence.LiNeBrEaKSecond, it has become clear in the past five years that the Earth is responding to the increasing CO(-2) loading of the atmosphere much more rapidly than scientists initially thought. There are numerous examples; the summer sea ice of the Arctic Ocean is melting far more quickly than anyone imagined.LiNeBrEaKThird, it has become apparent, even more recently, that global emissions of CO(-2) are shooting up at a rate that far exceeds anything the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change thought possible when it sketched out future emissions scenarios in a special report in 2000. Even though we have had 20 years to think about emissions cuts, and 11 years of the Kyoto protocol, the treaty that actually prescribed the first cuts for the industrialized countries, emissions are soaring as never before.LiNeBrEaKSome leading climate scientists are now openly voicing concerns that this makes it increasingly unlikely we can meet the aim of keeping global temperature rise to about 2C above the pre-industrial level, which is generally regarded as the most that may be endured by human society without mortal danger. Certainly, if we are to have any chance at all at holding the increase to two degrees, there is wide agreement that global emissions have to peak very soon - probably by 2015 or 2016 - and then rapidly decrease, to 80 percent below present levels by 2050. The later the peak, the greater (and therefore more difficult) the subsequent decrease would have to be.LiNeBrEaKThat's the pathway the world has to follow. Copenhagen offers the chance to set out along it. But even if the deal in December is not as ambitious as scientists and environmentalists insist is necessary - and at the moment, that seems pretty likely - it is vital there is actually an accord.LiNeBrEaKDisagreement would be a catastrophe.LiNeBrEaKThree conditions, according to Britain's energy and climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, have to be fulfilled for Copenhagen to be regarded as a success. First, the wealthy industrialized countries have to agree tough new targets for cutting their C0(-2). Second, the developing countries led by China, even if they do not take on the same sort of numerical targets, have to move away from "business as usual." And third, the rich nations have to agree a way of financing the developing countries, especially the poorer ones, in the measures they take to adapt to the climate change that is coming anyway. Otherwise they won't sign up to anything.LiNeBrEaKSecuring such a deal will be a matter of political will: A global political consensus will have to be hammered out. It is becoming clear that, over the next 11 months, the world could well do with a high-level political fixer, jetting unceasingly from capital to capital, to pull such a consensus together, in the manner in which the Argentine diplomat, Raul Estrada, managed to pull the original Kyoto agreement together in the Japanese city in December 1997. It could be Britain's Miliband, according to Tom Burke. "There has to be someone who can put the time in, and go round various capitals and talk to the key people at a very high level, and not just environment ministers," he says. "Ed Miliband could play that role. He's known to be close to Gordon Brown, and Britain is reasonably respected for its record on climate change. It doesn't have to be him. But there probably needs to be someone."LiNeBrEaKIn the absence of Miliband or any other leading politician emerging as the Copenhagen fixer, the key player in the process is likely to be Obama. He has already opened a chasm, in terms of climate change policy, between himself and George Bush, who, in 2001, withdrew the U.S. from Kyoto and began years of climate policy obstructionism.LiNeBrEaKBush wanted no truck with emissions cuts of any sort; Obama has pledged he will get U.S. emissions down to 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050 (a target identical with Britain's) and "engage vigorously" with the international negotiating process over the next few months. Hints have been dropped that he may convene meetings of key world leaders to speed the negotiations along. It seems highly likely he will go to Copenhagen himself, which means every other world leader will want to be present.LiNeBrEaKWhether they can do the deal the world needs is another matter. Yet there is no doubt the world needs it. It may seem reasonable to think, in the coldest winter for years, that global warming has gone away, yet nothing could be further from the truth.LiNeBrEaKMichael McCarthy writes for The Independent of Britain.

Because of Bond's leadership, Bush said in a statement, "we are protecting the liberties of our citizens while gathering vital information we need to prevent attacks on our soil." LiNeBrEaKOn so-called Senate reforms, Bond also has departed from the pack. He has defended "pork" even as the Senate moves toward prohibiting earmarks - pet projects - on spending bills. To his critics, he remarked last year: "In the next batch, I'll bring my own barbecue sauce."LiNeBrEaKAnd while climate change and other "green" issues have become increasingly popular in Congress, Bond has done battle with environmentalists, who refer to him as "Sen. Smog." He has signaled that he will be among the Senate's chief opponents on proposed curbs on greenhouse gases to combat climate change.LiNeBrEaK"We will have to rent a very big hall for all of those who will celebrate to see him leave town," said Frank O'Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch, a Washington advocacy group.LiNeBrEaKBond's style would be hard to duplicate. A Princeton graduate, he is equally at home lecturing White House Office of Management and Budget analysts or holding forth on the proper working of his favorite bass lure on a Missouri pond.LiNeBrEaKHowever he is viewed, Bond has, in 22 years in the Senate, cut a wide path in Washington and has been a largely effective senator on behalf of many Missouri interests, especially farmers and military veterans.LiNeBrEaK"Everybody sees him as a pretty smart, energetic and driven guy, somebody who brings a lot of experience to the table," said Norm Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington. "What's also true is that as the process in Washington has become more partisan, Bond has become more partisan as well."LiNeBrEaKLosing the power of earmarks might have played a role in Bond's decision, said David Kimball, an associate professor of political science at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.LiNeBrEaK"He's been a 'porky' senator and done things for Missouri in ways that have fallen out of favor," Kimball said. "I'm guessing that perhaps in the near future, he would not have as much opportunity to direct money to Missouri as in the past."LiNeBrEaKThe prospect of being submerged for years in the minority also may have been a consideration in Bond's surprise announcement last week. Democrats are likely to control the Senate 59-41 this Congress. In 2010, with the GOP once again enduring several Senate retirements and defending some key seats, Republicans could face a decidedly uphill quest to regain Senate control.LiNeBrEaK"For politicians like Bond, who see the world in terms of us-versus-them - and you're the 'us' and you're in the minority - there isn't a whole lot that gets your juices flowing," Ornstein said.LiNeBrEaKWashington University's Steven Smith, a congressional expert and director of the Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government and Public Policy, said Bond had failed to reach his potential in the Senate for reasons beyond his control.LiNeBrEaK"He was part of a reform element, somebody looking for ways to distinguish himself from fellow conservatives, someone willing to work on urban issues, family leave and other matters even when his party and his president opposed them," Smith said.LiNeBrEaKBut Bond's path was blocked, Smith argues, by a distinctly partisan turn in the Senate that began in the late 1980s and exists to this day. "Because of the nature of our politics, almost everyone, despite their personal inclinations, ultimately had to choose sides," Smith said.LiNeBrEaKBond's coming departure has triggered jockeying in both parties. Robin Carnahan, Missouri's secretary of state, is widely mentioned as a likely Democratic aspirant, and a recent poll showed that she would have been a strong candidate against Bond.LiNeBrEaKShe is heir to the Carnahan political legacy in Missouri and could enjoy the support of Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill.

Roy Blunt, who recently stepped away from House leadership, was making telephone calls to explore a candidacy and appears poised to run. Blunt, of Strafford in southwestern Missouri, is steeped in national issues by virtue of spending a decade as a GOP leader. He also has demonstrated strong fundraising prowess, judging by the $3. 5 million his Rely on Your Beliefs political action committee has raised for the last two elections.LiNeBrEaKGregg Hartley, Blunt's former chief of staff and longtime political adviser, said that Blunt "is actively engaged.

Why buck the trend now? Okay, so the Bolts are also 0-13 at Pittsburgh in regular-season games. Big deal. They lost at Heinz Field on Nov. 16 by the slightest of margins, 11-10. On a day the Steelers got all the breaks. LiNeBrEaKTHE STEELERS WILL WIN BECAUSELiNeBrEaKThey're healthier where it counts most. QB Ben Roethlisberger seems recovered from his concussion, but Chargers RB LaDainian Tomlinson (groin) doesn't expect to play.

But his worst game of '08 was against these Steelers (15-26, 164 yards, 2 INTs, 44. 4 rating). He may not be able to do much better without L.T. picking up all those Blitzburghers. As much as we adore RB Darren Sproles as a terrific weapon, his 5-6, 181-pound frame isn't made for blitz pickups.LiNeBrEaKYOU WILL KNOW . . .LiNeBrEaKChargers P Mike Scifres. Yeah, we cheated a bit. He had his prime-time coming-out party in the OT wild-card win over the Colts last Sunday night. Scifres will play a vital role again. Can he come close to duplicating his NFL playoff record of dropping six punts inside the opponents' 20? Four of them inside the 10? Only if the punting gods are in his corner again. "You can control the distance and the height to a pretty good degree," Scifres told the San Diego Union-Tribune. "(Once) the ball hits the ground, it has a mind of its own. ...

Times-Standard (Eureka, California)  	January 11, 2009 Sunday 	Federal focus on greenhouse gas reduction means more grant money  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	324 words  	Jan. 11--Redwood Community Action Agency and similar entities throughout the state have seen an increase in federal grant funds for energy-related assistance to low-income residents. LiNeBrEaKThe increase -- four times more for California -- comes with the federal government's increased focus on reducing greenhouse gases to slow global warming.LiNeBrEaKRCAA Executive Director Val Martinez said that increase in funding translates to $2. 7 million for Humboldt County, up from the normal allotment of $500,000. Nationwide, $5. 1 billion in federal dollars has been earmarked for this effort, $245 million in California. Usually, Martinez said, the state receives $84 million.LiNeBrEaKRCAA's energy assistance programs take a couple of different approaches.LiNeBrEaKThe low-income home energy assistance program assists qualified clients with paying heating bills -- whether it's propane, firewood, heating oil, kerosene or their PGandE bill. Another program has funds for repairing or replacing heaters.LiNeBrEaKMoney is also available to help low-income homeowners weatherize their homes, which includes such services as insulation, repairing broken windows and more.LiNeBrEaKOne of the federal government's objectives, Martinez said, is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. That effort will likely even get more money under President-elect Barack Obama's administration, she said.LiNeBrEaKTo make an appointment for the weatherization program, call 444-3831 ext. 204 on Mondays from 9 to 11 a.m. Information on the home energy assistance program is available by calling 444-3831.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	January 11, 2009 Sunday   Final Home Edition	Bigger picture  	Opinion; Pg. G2  	249 words  	 In response to everyone who sees one month of cooler weather and thinks there is no such thing as global warming: That is a very egocentric way of thinking. Global warming is not happening just here in Tulsa, and it does not mean that everybody's temperature is going up drastically. LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming happens to the Earth as a whole and makes the global temperatures go up a degree or two. It happens slowly but it is still faster than has ever been recorded, going back tens of thousands of years as recorded by scientists studying ice cores.LiNeBrEaKA degree or two affects the oceans' temperatures significantly and because this planet is mostly ocean it will a.ect the weather. Our temperatures may not increase that much, if at all. What global warming will affect is the weather. More intense storms, more flooding rains, longer periods of drought, more intense heat in the summer and more intense cold in the winter.LiNeBrEaKSo please stop with the denial just because we have a cooler month or year.LiNeBrEaKSusan Sullivan, Broken ArrowLiNeBrEaKLetters to the editor are encouraged.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	January 11, 2009 Sunday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	Legislators must act on Virginia's climate risks  	LOCAL; Pg. B11  	620 words  	By GLENDA C. BOOTHLiNeBrEaKAS NEW NATIONAL leaders take charge and commit to stemming global warming, the Virginia General Assembly should be an active partner and address what President-elect Barack Obama has called our "planet in peril," the urgent threat of heat-trapping gases that could wreak havoc on the state's coastal region.LiNeBrEaKThe buildup of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels could boost temperatures as much as 11 degrees, bring more extreme hurricanes and cause the Chesapeake Bay to rise two to five feet by 2100. LiNeBrEaKWith 112 miles of coastline and 3,300 miles of tidal shoreline, Virginia is "at particular risk," reported the governor's Commission on Climate Change on Dec. 15. Because of the state's latitudinal location, Virginia could suffer more than other state. Higher water levels will bring increased salinities, more shoreline erosion, more flooding and heavier nutrient flows, the commission found.LiNeBrEaKThe Bay area could lose more than 167,000 acres of land. Ocean beaches could shrink by 58 percent and estuarine beaches by 69 percent, says the National Wildlife Federation.LiNeBrEaKHigher oceans imperil roads, ports, railways, utilities and some of the commonwealth's military installations. "The Virginia Beach-Norfolk Metropolitan Statistical Area ranks 10th in the world in value of assets exposed to increased flooding from sea level rise," commissioners stressed.LiNeBrEaKMore severe weather events could lead to higher insurance rates. The commission warns, "Because insurers fear that the past may no longer predict the future, the cost of insurance is likely to include a premium for uncertainty."LiNeBrEaKScientists say we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050. This means curbing what spews out of our vehicles, factories, buildings and homes.LiNeBrEaKAmong the commission's recommendations:LiNeBrEaK* Implement energy efficiencies that reduce electricity use by 19 percent, including tougher building codes and more energy-saving appliances. (Energy efficiencies are a win-win that cut consumer and government costs and greenhouse gases. They should be an easy vote for legislators wrestling with difficult budget cuts.)LiNeBrEaK* When considering development, align land use and transportation planning, measure impact on greenhouse gases, factor in sea level rise and more frequent storm surges, avoid building in vulnerable coastal areas and choose "living shorelines" over hard structures.LiNeBrEaK* Make development more compact and transit-oriented; expand transit and rail. Freight moved over rail is three times more fuel efficient than freight hauled on roads.LiNeBrEaK* Build more energy-conserving buildings and retrofit the old ones.LiNeBrEaK* Increase the tree canopy and ensure no net loss of natural carbon-absorbing "sinks," like forests, farms and wetlands.LiNeBrEaKSome good ideas fell by the wayside or were rejected outright. Rather than endorsing the science-based reduction goal of 80 percent by 2050 over 1990 levels, commissioners supported 80 percent reductions over current levels. On a 15-14 vote, commissioners killed a moratorium on coal-fired plants until carbon capture technology is proven. They backed down from requiring that 20 percent of electricity be generated by clean fuels and instead included a 15 percent voluntary standard, even though 28 states have mandates. And commissioners dodged tougher vehicle emissions requirements.LiNeBrEaKIn an October poll, 61 percent of Virginians cited global warming as a very serious problem and 72 percent said it requires immediate government action.LiNeBrEaKThe threat is real. The sentiment is clear. All sectors must act. It's the General Assembly's turn now .LiNeBrEaKGlenda C. Booth is Virginia outreach coordinator for the National Audubon Society.

The Washington Times 	January 11, 2009 Sunday 	Kyoto and the gas supply  	LETTERS; B02  	473 words  	Reading "Natural gas shutoff frosts Europe" (World, Thursday) caused me to consider it in light of Kyoto's impact if it were to be adopted. Here are some thoughts. LiNeBrEaKRussia's economic saber rattling brings the Kyoto energy treaty effects into focus. Europe, for the second winter in a decade, has had a major portion of its natural gas supply cut off. Vladimir Putin, who pulled the plug, is rattling his energy saber.LiNeBrEaKThe sound, in the European Union's halls of power, is very loud. The record cold, caused, of course, by global warming and now being felt by the EU's shivering people, is as unrelenting as the Russian bear. Icy gloom is the order of the day. Even imbibing multiliter volumes of Moet et Chandon fails to bring cheer.LiNeBrEaKHappily, there is a silver lining to be found on the dissipating CO2 clouds that cause so much of Europe's Earth angst. This huge amount of Russia's evil fossil fuel no longer contributes to the demise of the polar bears' delicately frozen habitat.LiNeBrEaKOcean levels will be restrained from rising. Endangered species, breathing their last due to an intemperately changing climate, will be reinvigorated and feel like their old propagating selves again. It just takes this tiny taste of what the Kyoto climate treaty will really do to keep its European supporters on the "let's cut more carbon emissions" track.LiNeBrEaKA renewed enthusiasm will thaw the cold cockles of their "we want chilly, hot must stop" ) little hearts. Mr. Putin only had to show them the way. What will a jealous Al Gore do to top this? He must be "green" with envy.LiNeBrEaKJOHN LEWISLiNeBrEaKBaltimoreLiNeBrEaKReportedly, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin had ordered the Russian natural-gas monopoly Gazprom to cut the daily natural-gas shipments to Western Europe by 15 percent as people are experiencing a particularly cold winter. According to the Ukrainian oil-and-gas company Naftogaz, Gazprom had stopped its shipments to Ukraine in addition to reductions to Western Europe through pipelines crossing Ukraine. Russia has specifically targeted former captive nations in its near orbit to intimidate them and to increase its domination of them.LiNeBrEaKWestern Europe tended to get reliable deliveries before, but now France, Germany, Austria and Hungary have also been affected by the latest round of cuts. The European Union and NATO can no longer ignore the confrontations and hope that Mr. Putin will continue to deliver gas fairly, without blackmail and intimidation, while they are trying to deal with foreign-policy issues such as active measures against Georgia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic states. In my opinion, Europe must diversify its supply routes and develop nuclear power along with other energy sources. It must coordinate policy toward Gazprom and an increasingly aggressive Russia.LiNeBrEaKLT. COL.

The Wichita Eagle (Kansas)  	January 11, 2009 Sunday 	EDITORIAL: State leaders must cut with care  	COMMENTARY  	625 words  	Jan. 11--On Monday, as Gov. Kathleen Sebelius delivers her seventh and penultimate State of the State speech, her audience will be watching to see whether she pulls a rabbit out of her hat to fix the $1 billion budget mess.LiNeBrEaK"The Capitol is just abuzz with rumors right now," said state Rep. Josh Svaty, D-Ellsworth. "Everybody wants to see how she plans on moving through this." LiNeBrEaKAnd, we might add, whether the Democratic governor's plans have any prayer of passage by the Republican-controlled Legislature.LiNeBrEaKPart of Sebelius' solution likely will be President-elect Barack Obama's economic stimulus package, which will include aid to states. Those federal dollars, which are expected to target programs for the poor and unemployed as well as infrastructure needs, could offset some of the cuts in the near term, as Kansas faces an estimated $186 million budget shortfall in the fiscal year that ends June 30.LiNeBrEaKBut state leaders will need to use foresight in bringing spending in line with expected revenue for 2010.LiNeBrEaKExpectations for new spending are low, as they must be in such an economic environment. It seems impossible to hold to Sebelius' stated goals of protecting funding for K-12 schools and social services, which make up a combined two-thirds of the state budget. Increasing user fees and backing off scheduled tax cuts likely will be necessary.LiNeBrEaKDreams of $200 million a year in gambling revenue have evaporated, along with three of the four companies chosen to open and manage new casinos. Few think 2009 will see much action on a new comprehensive transportation plan to pick up where the 1999 plan's $13 billion in projects leave off.LiNeBrEaKThough a cigarette tax hike and statewide smoking ban likely will be discussed, substantive progress on Sebelius' top goal of health care reform may be a lost cause this year. But with the U.S. House planning a vote this week on renewing the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and the new president certain to sign it, state lawmakers should do their part to fund the eligibility expansion they approved last year for Kansas' SCHIP, called HealthWave.LiNeBrEaKThis is no time for renewed fights over illegal immigration, gambling or abortion. But it would be naive to expect no further attempts to green-light the Sunflower Electric Power Corp.' s coal-fired plant expansion near Holcomb, the proposal that gummed up the works of the 2008 legislative session. Its promise of construction jobs and other economic benefits is more attractive this year than last. Kansans can hope that even lawmakers disinclined to care about man-made climate change will ask some hard questions about whether Holcomb still fits into Kansas' energy future and even makes sense, especially given the changing regulatory, credit and economic climate nationally.LiNeBrEaKAnd Wichita-area legislators must be fierce in defending the state investments in affordable airfares, technical education, aviation research, water quality and graduate medical education -- all south-central Kansas priorities, but with large statewide economic impact long term.LiNeBrEaKBarring some gubernatorial magic, the legislative session promises lots of pain and disappointment. Lawmakers would be wise to focus all the energy and collegiality they can muster on reaching the prize -- a balanced budget -- then get out of Topeka.LiNeBrEaKFor the editorial board, Rhonda Holman	EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (91%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (90%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (90%); BUDGET (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); LEGISLATORS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH and WELFARE LAW (87%); GOVERNORS (78%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (78%); GOVERNMENT HEALTH INSURANCE (78%); EDUCATION FUNDING (77%); NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE (76%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (76%); TAX INCENTIVES (74%); 2008 ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN (74%); TAX INCREASES (73%); CASINOS (72%); TRANSPORTATION PLANNING (71%); CLIMATE CHANGE (71%); CREDIT REGULATION (71%); HEALTH CARE POLICY (70%); GAMING (69%); TAX LAW (69%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (68%); ECONOMIC NEWS (68%); SMOKING (68%); HEALTH CARE LAW (67%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (64%); TOBACCO PRODUCTS (63%); HEALTH CARE REFORM (62%); HEALTH INSURANCE (62%); CHILDREN'S HEALTH (62%); PLANT CONSTRUCTION (60%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (60%); IMMIGRATION (50%); ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS (50%); US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009 (69%); US PRESIDENTS (74%)  	KATHLEEN SEBELIUS (93%); BARACK OBAMA (57%)  	KANSAS, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 11, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Wichita Eagle   	The Wichita Eagle, Kan.

The Wisconsin State Journal  	January 11, 2009 Sunday 	On Campus: Geothermal energy coming to University of Wisconsin-Madison  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	392 words  	Jan. 11--Drilling began last week for a geothermal heating and cooling system for the future Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery -- the first research facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison to use the economical energy source. LiNeBrEaKThe system, which uses the relatively constant temperature of the earth to regulate building temperature, will provide an annual 10 percent savings on energy use.LiNeBrEaKWorkers bored 75 holes approximately 300 feet below the site, at the intersection of University Avenue and Campus Drive. The cost of the underground geothermal system, expected to function for at least 50 years, is $1. 25 million.LiNeBrEaKThe building, set to open in 2010, consists of twin institutes: the publicly funded Wisconsin Institute for Discovery and the private Morgridge Institute for Research. It will house researchers doing interdisciplinary research designed to improve human health.LiNeBrEaKRECESSION BRAINSTORMING SESSION: UW-Madison students, faculty and staff will have at least one more opportunity -- on Jan. 22 -- to brainstorm ideas about how the university can successfully operate in a recession.LiNeBrEaKThree previous sessions, held last month, resulted in dozens of ideas aimed a making the university more efficient and effective. This fourth session was scheduled so that students who may have missed earlier sessions because of conflicts with final exams will be able to attend.LiNeBrEaKThe session will be held from 4: 30 to 5: 30 p.m. in Grainger Hall.

Akron Beacon Journal (Ohio)  	January 10, 2009 Saturday 	Power plant to be built in Ohio: Meigs County facility expected to serve 81 cities, including Cuyahoga Falls, Hudson, Wadsworth  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	332 words  	Jan. 10--Bechtel Power Corp. will engineer, procure and build a $3. 25 billion coal-burning power plant in southern Ohio.LiNeBrEaKThe California company was tapped Thursday by Columbus-based American Municipal Power Ohio to oversee building the plant along the Ohio River. LiNeBrEaKThe project remains contingent upon final permits and successful negotiation of state and local incentives, said AMP-Ohio, a wholesale power supplier.LiNeBrEaKConstruction can't start yet, but Bechtel Power can begin preliminary engineering and procurement of equipment related to the 1,000-megawatt plant.LiNeBrEaKThe electricity from the plant, expected to be in operation in 2014, will go to 81 municipal electric systems in Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia and Virginia. Cities served will include Cuyahoga Falls, Hudson, Wadsworth, Orrville, Seville, Lodi, Brewster and Beach City.LiNeBrEaKThe plant, near Racine in Meigs County, has come under fire from several environmental groups. Critics say the plant will contribute to global warming, and they call its anti-pollution system unproven.LiNeBrEaKAMP-Ohio officials said the project will provide affordable and reliable energy to member communities, and they defended the Powerspan technology that is being used to clean up pollution. The plant, with its ammonia-based scrubbing system, will be the cleanest in Ohio and one of the cleanest in the country, the officials said.LiNeBrEaKAMP-Ohio operates a coal-fired plant near Marietta, a hydroelectric project on the Ohio River and a commercial wind farm near Bowling Green.

Austin American-Statesman (Texas) 	January 10, 2009 Saturday   Final Edition	Greenhouse gases may be low priority for lawmakers  	MAIN; Pg. A01  	912 words  	On the presidential campaign trail, both Barack Obama and , John McCain said they would champion federal measures that cap emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas linked to global warming.LiNeBrEaKBut with "global warming" a radioactive term in the Texas Legislature, state lawmakers in the coming session are expected to constrain their response to environmental issues to a series of measures that encourage consumers to buy efficient appliances and build more efficient houses and coax utilities to invest in renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKThe energy and environment issue is at the crux of the state's industrial and demographic future. Home to manufacturing and oil refining facilities up and down the Gulf Coast, Texas is the nation's No. 1 carbon dioxide emitter. Meanwhile, with the state's population growing by as much as 50 percent by 2030, utilities are proposing more power plants, some of them cheap-to-produce coal plants. LiNeBrEaKShaping policy under the dome, key lawmakers say they remain unconvinced auto and manufacturing emissions of carbon dioxide contribute to a changing climate.LiNeBrEaKThe issue could pit some of the state's top Republican lawmakers against one another. On one side are Gov. Rick Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and a host of House committee chairmen who dismiss anxieties about global warming and who torpedoed most pieces of environmental legislation in the last session. Along with industry groups, they say any kind of federal caps on carbon dioxide emissions could derail the state's economy and cost billions of dollars in compliance.LiNeBrEaKOn the other side are Republicans like state Sen. Kip Averitt of Waco and likely House Speaker Joe Straus, who have indicated they think the state should try to shape the impending carbon dictate from Washington rather than criticizing it.LiNeBrEaKStraus, who served on an interim committee on electric generation capacity and environmental effects and authored an energy efficiency law last session, could appoint a phalanx of chairmen on key energy and environmental committees and expand incentives for renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKAt least 12 pieces of legislation related to global warming were proposed in the last session; only one, a bill calling for a study of Rio Grande water supplies, passed.LiNeBrEaKSome Texas Democrats have said they hope to change that record. In a speech in early December, state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, told a group of venture capitalists that climate change presented the state with an opportunity to reshape its economy into one leading the way on alternative energy projects.LiNeBrEaKThe state's leaders, he said, "seem more focused on waging battles against the rest of the nation, against the world, in an effort to hold back the future racing toward us."LiNeBrEaKThis session, at least two measures, both filed by state Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, aim to address global warming.LiNeBrEaKOne sets up a fund to pay for "green job" training, or jobs related to energy-efficient building, biofuels, home energy efficiency assessments, and the manufacturing of sustainable products; the other orders the state to emit no more greenhouse gases in 2023 than it did in 1990.LiNeBrEaKBut interviews with key lawmakers suggest little hope for global warming measures, especially ones that make no effort to disguise themselves as such.LiNeBrEaK"That term is contentious and off-putting to some people," state Rep. Charles "Doc" Anderson, R-Waco , who is a member of the select committee on energy capacity and the environment. He said the global warming debate remains unresolved.LiNeBrEaKActually, consensus among many scientists holds that Earth's climate is gradually warming, in part because of humanmade emissions of carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKPerry has signaled opposition to limits on carbon dioxide emissions.LiNeBrEaKInstead, Republican leaders say they will propose measures that encourage the manufacture and purchase of energy-efficient home appliances and toughen building codes to make homes more efficient.LiNeBrEaKLikely speaker Straus, who authored a measure last session that set up a sales tax holiday for energy efficient appliances, said "there's going to be more interest and engagement in the environment."LiNeBrEaKBut some Republicans said they would also call for a panoply of tax breaks and subsidies for the construction of not just wind turbines and solar panels, but also conventional forms of generation like coal-fired power plants.LiNeBrEaK"We need all of it," said state Rep. Rick Hardcastle, R-Vernon, who chaired the Energy Resources Committee last session.LiNeBrEaKBut some lawmakers said they think Texas should start preparing for federal caps on carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaK"Texas is making a big mistake in not being at the table when those issues are being discussed in Washington, D.C.," said Averitt, who chairs the Senate Natural Resources Committee.LiNeBrEaKAveritt said he would propose a bill that could stiffen building codes and appliance standards and offer incentives to retire old air conditioners and refrigerators for newer, energy-efficient ones. But he said he would not support any state proposal that limits carbon emissions in Texas because "if it provides a competitive advantage in the other 49 states, I'm not interested in that."LiNeBrEaKStraus said the state should bide its time as the federal government decides whether to regulate carbon dioxide emissions.LiNeBrEaK"The federal government will be more aggressive in this area, so the wise thing to do would be to give it a little bit of time, to see what the appropriate reaction from a Texas standpoint will be," he said.LiNeBrEaKasherprice@statesman.com; 445-3643	EMISSIONS (93%); LEGISLATORS (93%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (91%); GLOBAL WARMING (91%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); POLITICAL PARTIES (89%); POWER PLANTS (89%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (89%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (89%); LEGISLATION (89%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (89%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (78%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (78%); AUTOMOTIVE FUELS (78%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (78%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); CAMPAIGNS and ELECTIONS (78%); POPULATION SIZE (77%); GREEN BUILDING (76%); POPULATION GROWTH (75%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (73%); VENTURE CAPITAL (71%); COAL INDUSTRY (68%); ECONOMIC NEWS (64%); MARKET DEMOGRAPHICS (56%); DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS (76%)  	BARACK OBAMA (91%); JOHN MCCAIN (91%); RICK PERRY (55%)  	TEXAS, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 10, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Austin American-Statesman All Rights Reserved  	Asher Price AMERICAN-STATESMAN STAFF  																					
The Beaumont Enterprise (Texas)  	January 10, 2009 Saturday 	Ike post-mortem: Experts disassemble monster storm's causes  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	569 words  	Jan. 10--Photos of coastal Texas before and after Hurricane Ike give a sort of "now you see it; now you don't effect, as if Ike were playing David Copperfield with beach houses.LiNeBrEaKTen houses in Jamaica Beach. Ninety-one houses from Crystal Beach. All but five from Gilchrist.LiNeBrEaKAs longtime meteorologist and former director of the National Hurricane Center Neil Frank clicked through a Power Point presentation, it brought back the initial feeling of disbelief and sadness at the profound alteration of previously idyllic beach communities. LiNeBrEaKAt a conference Friday at University of St. Thomas in Houston, "Understanding Ike, does size matter," experts from various fields gathered to share information on Hurricane Ike, the baffling storm that was the third most destructive in American history, despite its Category 2 designation.LiNeBrEaKWith Texas hit by named storms Dolly, Edouard and Ike last year, residents are left wondering what's going on.LiNeBrEaKBut if it seems like hurricanes have become more frequent and more intense than they used to be, resist the temptation to jump to conclusions about global warming, some meteorologists say.LiNeBrEaKA number of factors contribute to that impression.LiNeBrEaKBecause storms are rated based on wind speed, rather than barometric pressure, some systems reach named status al-though they lack the low pressure that would allow them to develop into a tropical cyclone, Frank said.LiNeBrEaK"On the basis of (barometric) pressure, not wind, (Ike) would have been called a Category 3," he noted.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, satellites record more storms out at sea that in the past would have gone undetected.LiNeBrEaK"Historic records are not adequate to say man-made global warming is causing more storms," Frank said.LiNeBrEaKAnd some of it is just that too much time has passed.LiNeBrEaKIn an active period between the 1930s and 1960s, 12 named storms hit Texas.LiNeBrEaKFrank also cited destructive storms in 1875 and 1893, as well as the storm that killed up to 10,000 in Galveston in 1900 and another major storm in 1915.LiNeBrEaKAlso at the conference, Shell Oil spokesman Stuart Furgang described the destructive impact of various storms in re-cent years as well as how the company copes with the disruption.LiNeBrEaKFurgang described the way personnel were evacuated in stages, leaving behind a last crew to "turn off the lights" only leaving at the very last minute -- or staying to keep the operation going should the storm turn.LiNeBrEaKHe described platforms that endured hours of 175 mph winds during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and 52-foot waves lashing platforms during Ivan in 2004.LiNeBrEaKLt.

The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)  	January 10, 2009 Saturday 	AMP-Ohio taps builder for $3. 3B power plant  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	454 words  	Jan. 10--AMP-Ohio yesterday announced it has hired one of the world's largest contractors to build the $3. 3 billion coal-fired power plant in southeast Ohio it wants for 81 of its member communities, nearly a third of which are in northwest Ohio. LiNeBrEaKSan Francisco-based Bechtel Power Corp., which has 42,500 employees and is involved in more than 22,000 projects in 140 countries, has been secured to head up construction, AMP-Ohio said.LiNeBrEaKAMP-Ohio, also known as American Municipal Power-Ohio Inc., is a nonprofit wholesale power supplier founded in 1971 to negotiate electric rates for its 120 member communities across Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Virginia, and West Virginia.LiNeBrEaKEighty-one of them are to be served by the new power plant, slated to be operating in late 2013.LiNeBrEaKTwenty-five are in northwest Ohio, including Bowling Green, Napoleon, Bryan, Clyde, Deshler, Edgerton, Elmore, Genoa, Montpelier, Oak Harbor, Haskins, Holiday City, Pemberville, Pioneer, Sycamore, and Woodville.LiNeBrEaKAMP-Ohio is planning to build the power plant along the Ohio River in Meigs County's Letart Township.LiNeBrEaKThe company expects the project to generate 1,600 temporary construction jobs. The plant will employ 165 full-time operators, Marc Gerken, AMP-Ohio president-chief executive officer, said.LiNeBrEaKThe project is undergoing the permit phase, AMP-Ohio said.LiNeBrEaKMr. Gerken said it "is part of a strategic generation asset development effort in response to changes in the wholesale electric market -- a market that has become extremely volatile and increasingly dysfunctional."LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups have accused AMP-Ohio of low-balling its member communities on costs. The member communities will be responsible for price increases.LiNeBrEaKWhen the project was announced in October, 2005, the cost was pegged at $1. 2 billion.LiNeBrEaKCoal-fired power plants are the nation's largest source of carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas associated with global warming.LiNeBrEaKAMP-Ohio yesterday reiterated its faith in a pollution-control technology it plans to use. Known as Powerspan, the technology was developed by a New Hampshire company by the same name.LiNeBrEaKThe Andersons, based in Maumee, agreed in 2007 to crystallize and package the ammonia sulfate waste generated by the Powerspan process and sell it as a fertilizer.LiNeBrEaK[/apps/pbcs.dll/news_newmessage?Category=FORUMSandGroupID=1,0,0]	POWER PLANTS (92%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (91%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (90%); CONSTRUCTION (90%); POWER and COMMUNICATION SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (90%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (89%); ELECTRICITY WHOLESALERS (89%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (89%); EMISSIONS (78%); APPOINTMENTS (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY TRADE (77%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (76%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (75%); WATER POLLUTION (71%); UTILITY RATES (70%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (69%); GLOBAL WARMING (68%); FERTILIZERS (65%); ELECTRICITY MARKETS (64%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (64%); PRICE INCREASES (50%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (72%)  		OHIO, USA (99%); CALIFORNIA, USA (92%); WEST VIRGINIA, USA (79%); PENNSYLVANIA, USA (79%); MICHIGAN, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (99%)  	January 10, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Blade   	Tom Henry, The Blade, Toledo, Ohio  				Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	Agriculture/Food  	20090110-TO-AMP-Ohio-taps-builder-for-3. 3B-power-plant-0110  	TO  		BECHTEL POWER CORP (72%); MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (61%)

LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental officials from the Bay State and 10 others in the Northeast announced plans last week to present, by the end of this year, not a standard but a blueprint for developing one.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 10, 2009 Saturday 	Nation's capital rolls out green carpet for Obama inaugural celebrations  	NATIONAL POLITICAL NEWS  	972 words  	WASHINGTON _ For the inauguration of a president who promised to be a friend of the environment, what would you expect but carbon-neutral inaugural balls, hybrid Lexuses, organic menus and valet bicycle parking?LiNeBrEaKPolitical correctness will rule the day.LiNeBrEaKTwo Green Inaugural Balls are planned, including one featuring a green carpet made from _ what else? _ a recycled rug. Official invitations to the Jan. 20 inauguration are being printed on recycled paper. The homeless will be handed furs. LiNeBrEaKWith millions of visitors headed to Washington for President-elect Barack Obama's swearing-in, "Our goal is to create an unforgettable evening while treading lightly on the Earth," said Jenna Mack, an organizer of one Green Inaugural Ball _ not to be confused with another Green Inaugural Ball featuring Al Gore.LiNeBrEaKBeyond the Earth-minded, nearly every imaginable group is planning an event to promote a cause.LiNeBrEaKPETA plans to give away fur coats to the homeless while offering hot soy milk cocoa in cups that read: "Thank You for Not Wearing Fur!"LiNeBrEaK"We expect that the only fur on the streets on Jan. 20 will be on homeless people," said Bruce Friedrich, PETA vice president.LiNeBrEaKThe furs, collected from people who don't want them anymore, will be marked with black paint before they are given away so that they cannot be sold.LiNeBrEaKAmong other celebrations with a cause: The Peace Ball, billed as "the largest gathering of peace activists without a protest."LiNeBrEaKThe greening of the inauguration is drawing a special effort, because Obama has made "green" projects a centerpiece of his economic stimulus plan and is expected to highlight the environment in his inaugural address.LiNeBrEaK"Not only are we committed to holding an inauguration that is the most open and accessible in history," said Linda Douglass, chief spokeswoman for Obama's inaugural committee, "but we are also committed to making sure that it is as environmentally friendly and sustainable as possible."LiNeBrEaKThe Environmental Protection Agency has provided a liaison to the Presidential Inaugural Committee to advise on "best practices" _ a first, Douglass said.LiNeBrEaK"We're obviously not going to have paper towels in the bathroom," said Shelley Cohen, helping organize the event featuring Gore, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize for efforts in preventing climate change. "We're going to have air dryers."LiNeBrEaK"Making the inaugural balls as low-energy and low-carbon as possible won't stop global warming, but it is a very important symbol about the direction of the incoming administration," said Dan Weiss, director of climate strategy for the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.LiNeBrEaKTo reduce the inauguration's carbon footprint, attendees are being encouraged to carpool or ride public transit, even in evening gowns and tuxedos. If they must drive, they are being encouraged to drive a hybrid vehicle or buy carbon offsets.LiNeBrEaKOrganizers of a number of balls plan to use energy-efficient lighting. But no one has figured out a way to hook up to a wind turbine exhibit on display near the U.S. Capitol.LiNeBrEaK"Downtown D.C. is hardly an optimal place for a wind turbine," said Ron Stimmel of the American Wind Energy Association.LiNeBrEaKSome of the floats in the inaugural parade are being recycled from past parades, including a 60-foot-long, 24-foot-tall American flag float built for Ronald Reagan's 1985 inauguration.LiNeBrEaKJimmy Carter made an attempt to be eco-friendly during his inauguration: The White House reviewing stand was supposed to be solar-heated. It did not work out as planned, said Albert Nason, archivist at the Jimmy Carter Library. Rosalynn Carter wrote: "Though it is supposedly a solar booth, something has happened to the sun this day and the booth's heater doesn't work."LiNeBrEaK"People have forgotten what a difference presidential leadership can make," Weiss said.LiNeBrEaKNot everyone's buying it, though.LiNeBrEaK"We've had the Christmas season, and it appears we're entering the silly season with efforts by many to look as if they're saving the environment when they're really not doing anything but engaging in feel-good politics," said Brian Darling of the conservative Heritage Foundation. "In reality, this whole inaugural is going to have a massive carbon footprint."LiNeBrEaKDarling expects to see far more gas-guzzling SUVs than bikes as people head to inaugural balls.LiNeBrEaK"If they really want to be environmental, maybe they'll take measures to invite fewer people to Washington," he said, noting the huge carbon footprint that millions of people will leave.LiNeBrEaKFor some, it's just practical to leave the car at home.LiNeBrEaKAt Segs in the City, which rents Segways, one-third of the fleet is already reserved. One business needed a way to make deliveries downtown without using cars, which will be prohibited. Other people need to get to work.LiNeBrEaK"People who work in offices and knew they would not be able to get back and forth throughout the day are just using them instead of their vehicle and their feet," said Kenny Ellington, a tour guide for the company.LiNeBrEaKWhile inaugural organizers try to promote a new sense of green-being, all receptions and catered events in the House of Representatives will feature biodegradable containers, plates and utensils, many made from corn resin.LiNeBrEaKAll plastics and Styrofoam are banned. Caterers put food scraps, containers and utensils into a "composting stream" for a facility in Maryland, an effort going on for more than a year.LiNeBrEaKPerry Plumart of the Green the Capitol office for the House said: "It goes from trash to dirt in 90 days."

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 10, 2009 Saturday 	Food crisis due to warming world trumps all other worries, say scientists  	SCIENCE; Environment; News; National; Business  	604 words  	Many of today's toddlers face the grim prospect of coping with chronic food shortages in their old age if agricultural science doesn't adapt to a warming world, concluded scientists in a study published Friday in the journal Science.LiNeBrEaKThe stark report, from scientists at Stanford University and the University of Washington, makes melting polar ice caps and rising sea levels from global warming appear minor compared with the prospect of hundreds of millions of people, including those living in Europe and the United States, anxiously seeking stable food supplies. LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming's effect on food production, said David Battisti, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington and lead author of the study, is one of "the foremost reasons" for concern about climate change. The study's co-author is Rosamond Naylor, director of Stanford University's Program on Food Security and the Environment.LiNeBrEaKBy the end of the century, the worst of the heat waves in recent times will become the normal average summertime temperatures, the researchers reported. They based their conclusions on 23 climate models in a 2007 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as well as data from severe heat waves dating several decades.LiNeBrEaKThere's a 90 percent probability, Battisti said, that by 2100, typical growing season temperatures in the tropics and the subtropics would exceed the most extreme seasonal temperatures recorded from 1900 to 2006. Those regions lie between 35 degrees latitude north and south, and include the Southeast and Southwest United States, southern Europe, Central America, northern Australia, as well as Africa and large swaths of India and China. About 3 billion people, or half the world's population, live in these regions   a figure expected to double by 2100.LiNeBrEaKBattisti and Naylor also based their estimate on assumptions that greenhouse gas emissions would level off by midcentury, and then begin declining. That scenario would lead to an approximate doubling of CO2 levels by the end of the century, he said.LiNeBrEaK"If anything, we took the most conservative approach," Battisti said.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, they didn't account for anticipated lower rainfall levels from climate change, or the spread of pests and pathogens attacking vulnerable, heat-stressed plants.LiNeBrEaK"So everything we neglected (to account for) seems to make things worse," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe scientists said yields of staple crops such as rice and corn could fall by 20 percent to 40 percent by the end of the century, as temperatures rise an average of 6 degrees during the growing seasons.LiNeBrEaKIn their article, Battisti and Naylor cited the 2003 heat wave in Western Europe to illustrate the potential effects of these higher temperatures. That extreme summer heat killed more than 50,000 people and cut some crop yields by a third. Such summer temperatures in the region would become the norm under the scientists' scenario.LiNeBrEaKBattisti said these findings, in his view, call for far more serious action to reverse global warming trends.LiNeBrEaKBut given the challenges in achieving such a reversal in the near term, he said it's imperative that agricultural research priorities shift beyond only producing drought-resistant plants, to ones that can maintain productivity even in high heats.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, more sophisticated trading systems would need development, he said, to distribute foods from areas with more productive farmlands to areas affected by rising heat.LiNeBrEaK"The main thing we're talking about is really large adaptations, or moving hundreds of millions of people," he said.LiNeBrEaKReach Suzanne Bohan at 510-262-2789 or sbohan@bayareanewsgroup.com	RESEARCH REPORTS (93%); SCIENCE NEWS (92%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (92%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); 2008 GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS (90%); FOOD CHARITIES (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); AGRICULTURE (89%); AGRONOMY (89%); WEATHER (89%); CROP RESEARCH (89%); CROP PRODUCTION (78%); METEOROLOGY (78%); EMISSIONS (77%); RESEARCH (77%); POPULATION SIZE (77%); COLLEGES and UNIVERSITIES (77%); GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (76%); RICE FARMING (73%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (72%); MODELING and SIMULATION (72%); POPULATION and DEMOGRAPHICS (72%)  		SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (92%) CALIFORNIA, USA (92%); WEST USA (79%); SOUTHWEST, USA (79%); SOUTHWEST USA (77%) UNITED STATES (94%); EUROPE (93%); AUSTRALIA (79%); CHINA (79%); CENTRAL AMERICA (79%); INDIA (79%); WESTERN EUROPE (57%); SOUTHERN EUROPE (55%)  	January 11, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved  	By Suzanne Bohan Contra Costa Times  	UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON (84%); STANFORD UNIVERSITY (84%); INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (55%)

Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville) 	January 10, 2009 Saturday 	PSC unanimously backs Crist on renewable goal;  Environmentalists are happy, but the biomass industry takes a blow. 	Pg. B-4  	540 words  	TALLAHASSEE -- The Public Service Commission unanimously backed a sweeping plan Friday that would require power companies to generate 20 percent of their power from renewable resources by 2020. LiNeBrEaKThe vote marked a victory for environmentalists, some in the alternative energy industry and Gov. Charlie Crist, who had backed the "20 percent by 2020" standard. But some of the provisions also dealt a blow to the biomass industry, which will have access to only a limited slice of the funds, and AARP, which had pushed for smaller potential rate hikes.LiNeBrEaKThe vote came at the end of a nearly six-hour meeting. The proposed rule now goes to the Legislature, which will have a chance to alter the plan when it begins its regular session in March.LiNeBrEaKIn going with Crist's standard, the commission brushed aside concerns from major, privately owned utilities like Florida Power and Light, as well as the PSC's staff. Both said the 2020 goal was too aggressive. Commission staff had floated a 2041 deadline.LiNeBrEaKThe PSC also rebuffed efforts by utilities to allow the companies to count as alternative energy nuclear power and a method of burning coal supporters call "clean coal" because the resulting carbon is buried underground.LiNeBrEaKEven as she backed the shorter timeline, Commissioner Lisa Polak Edgar conceded that the goal would require significant effort on the part of power companies.LiNeBrEaK"I see it as a stretch, but I also see that as part of the purpose," she said.LiNeBrEaKThe proposal is driven by concerns that the release of greenhouse gases is contributing to global warming. The carbon released by burning coal -- a major source of power in the U.S. and other industrialized nations -- is believed by most scientists to be a key driver of the planet's warming climate.LiNeBrEaKRenewables like solar, wind and biomass power, which is generated from burning wood, produce little or no carbon.LiNeBrEaKFederal officials are expected to consider their own renewable-power mandates once President-elect Barack Obama takes office this month.LiNeBrEaKUnder the plan, privately owned utilities must generate 7 percent of their power from alternative sources by 2012; 12 percent by 2015; and 18 percent by 2018 before making the 2020 benchmark.LiNeBrEaKThe utilities are allowed to raise their rates by a maximum of 2 percent a year to pay for the attempted transition; they are required only to spend the new rate revenues on alternative power.LiNeBrEaKAlso, the rule requires the companies to spend 75 percent of their proceeds on solar and wind power, even though those sources are expected to generate only a quarter of the required power. Commissioners hope the extra money will jump-start what is still one of the costliest sources of alternative energy.LiNeBrEaK"It's twice as big as we wanted ... and they gave special treatment to solar and wind," said Mike Twomey, an outside attorney for AARP.LiNeBrEaKBut environmentalists quibbled with the idea that the rate hikes would be burdensome for customers, pointing instead to the often-wild swings in the prices of natural gas and other fuels.LiNeBrEaK"It's the status quo that's hurting customers, not renewable energy," said George Cavros, an attorney representing the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.LiNeBrEaKbrandon.larrabee@morris.com, (678) 977-3709	RENEWABLE ENERGY (91%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (90%); BIOMASS (90%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (90%); SOLAR ENERGY (89%); PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES (89%); WIND POWER PLANTS (89%); WIND ENERGY (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY SECTOR PERFORMANCE (78%); SOLAR POWER PLANTS (78%); EMISSIONS (77%); LEGISLATORS (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); TALKS and MEETINGS (75%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (74%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (73%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (71%); CLIMATOLOGY (69%); GLOBAL WARMING (69%); ASTRONOMY and SPACE (68%)  	CHARLIE CRIST (92%); BARACK OBAMA (52%)  	TALLAHASSEE, FL, USA (91%) FLORIDA, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 12, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Florida Times-Union   	BRANDON LARRABEE  	AARP (AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF RETIRED PERSONS) (57%)  								FLORIDA POWER and LIGHT CO (56%)  												
Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	January 10, 2009 Saturday   ALL S EDITION	Public Pulse  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A7  	529 words  	Weather and climateLiNeBrEaKWill someone please explain to the cartoonists and writers to the Public Pulse the difference between weather and climate? One cannot deny the fact of global warming climatological phenomenon, by citing two weeks of cold and snowy weather in December anymore than one can affirm it by citing the very rapid thaw and resultant flooding that followed. Nor, for that matter, can one claim that a two-week summer heat wave is proof positive of it. LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming has been going on for years, especially since the retreat of the North American and Eurasian ice sheets and, yes, the resultant rise in sea level that obliterated the Bering Land Bridge. The Maunder Minimum notwithstanding, the general trend has been up.LiNeBrEaKThe question that bedevils some people is not whether global warming is taking place, but how much has man's activities since the industrial revolution accelerated the process. And I'll leave that to experts to decide (not the politicians).LiNeBrEaKRICHARD JACKSON Jr. /RockfordLiNeBrEaKPolice wages favor cityLiNeBrEaKThis is in response to Gerald Foy's letter ("Public employee pay," Pulse, Dec. 31), in which he expresses his dismay over wage increases given to Grand Rapids police officers in arbitration. Mr. Foy appears to be basing his opinion on partial information.LiNeBrEaKWhile it is true police officers will garner a 7. 5 percent increase over six months, the wage increase comes on the heels of no raises for said employees in 2. 5 years. In fact, the arbitrator's decision to grant wage increases was largely due to the union's ability to show that wage increases for Grand Rapids officers have lagged behind those of comparable communities, as well as the Consumer Price Index. The arbitration decision also denied retroactive pay for wages earned while officers were without a contract. This money plus interest earned is retained by the city.LiNeBrEaKMr. Foy also appears unaware that the overall arbitration decision clearly favors the city by eliminating its obligation to provide defined benefit retiree health insurance for non-vested officers. Eighty-eight officers will not receive a benefit they were counting on. Dramatic increases in employee health insurance premiums will also mostly negate the pay increase Mr. Foy so adamantly opposes.LiNeBrEaKAs Grand Rapids reflects on a violent holiday weekend in which police personnel were taxed to their limits, Mr. Foy can rest assured GRPD will continue to provide professional and dedicated service so that Mr. Foy may safely voice his dissent to our much-deserved compensation from the confines of a well-protected city.LiNeBrEaKDAVID J.

The Island Packet (Hilton Head Island, South Carolina)  	January 10, 2009 Saturday 	Coastal Carolina chosen for national environmental study  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	467 words  	Jan. 10--The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has chosen the coastal areas of North Carolina and South Carolina to be part of a national research project that will help communities make good environmental choices. LiNeBrEaKEPA officials are coming to Bluffton on Monday to present outline of the project and get comments from the public. The meeting will be followed by a daylong workshop in North Charleston of elected officials and leaders in planning, zoning and environmental protection.LiNeBrEaK"The idea is not to stop development or even slow it," said Dorsey Worthy of the EPA's Office of Research and Development. "We want increasing populations, but we want to do it in a knowledgeable and responsible way."LiNeBrEaKWorthy is leading the coastal Carolinas study, one of four community research projects in the country focused on understanding ecosystems that provide clean air and water, productive soils and food and fiber. The other studies are being conducted in the Tampa Bay, Fla., area, the Midwest and the Willamette River Basin in Oregon.LiNeBrEaKThe Carolinas project will look at landscapes, waterways and coastal wetlands from counties near Currituck Sound in North Carolina to those near the Savannah River. The area was selected because it faces pressures from population growth and landscape and climate change, Worthy said.LiNeBrEaK"If we take too much advantage of the system without acknowledging its restorative and human health aspects, we run the danger of creating an environment that won't sustain us," Worthy said. "It's not just about wildlife; it's about protecting human health in the long run."LiNeBrEaKWorthy said the meeting also will help the EPA shape the agency's research agenda for the next 10 years. About 60 scientists are assigned to the study.LiNeBrEaK"We want to hear what (leaders and residents) value in their communities and where they want their communities to go in the next few years," Worthy said.LiNeBrEaKAs research progresses, Worthy said, he and other EPA officials can help local communities access grants to protect and restore the environment.LiNeBrEaKNancy Schilling, founder of Friends of the Rivers, which is hosting the meeting Monday, said she hopesBeaufort County can earn national recognition for its protection of waterways.LiNeBrEaK"My goal with Friends of the Rivers is that we never have to get into restoration," she said, but "that we are into preservation of what we've got ... ."

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 	January 10, 2009 Saturday 	from our readers Wild imaginations drive global warming cult  	B; Pg. 8B  	1210 words  	To the editor:LiNeBrEaKA perfect example of the climate change cult was the John C. Bersia commentary, "Climate change requires quick, decisive action," in Thursday's Review-Journal.LiNeBrEaKHe starts his piece by stating that climate change is like a monster movie, and that if left unresolved it will lead to a virtual Armageddon. Mr. Bersia then turns to environmentalist Peter Pritchard, Time magazine's "Hero of the Planet," for the quick, decisive actions needed to avoid climate change catastrophe.LiNeBrEaKThe first action to be taken, according to Mr. Pritchard, is to continue our study of climate change, as we don't really understand it because it is so colossal and complicated. But, even though we don't understand the problem, we should immediately change our way of life, reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, stop development on our seacoasts and stop going to war by forming cultural and economic unions with all nations.LiNeBrEaKClimate change is a constant process that is a fact of life on our planet, and, from what I've read, small changes have affected life and agriculture in our recent geologic past of a couple of thousand years. LiNeBrEaKBut truly drastic changes take eons to evolve, not the eye-blink represented by our latest scientific observations.LiNeBrEaKI would suggest to Mr. Bersia that, yes, the climate change hysteria, as presented to our gullible societies, is absolutely a monster movie. It is not based on science, but uses bits of science with dubious computer modeling to validate imaginations gone wild.LiNeBrEaKIn my opinion, the current climate change panic is being used to support a large number of ulterior motives, most of which involve taking other people's money or justifying the use of political power to control other people's lives.LiNeBrEaKJim BrownLiNeBrEaKNorth Las VegasLiNeBrEaKClimate change flimflamLiNeBrEaKTo the editor:LiNeBrEaKThe University of Central Florida has "a special assistant to the president for global perspectives" in the person of John C. Bersia, a former journalist. There should be no doubt in our minds as to the scientific background of Mr. Bersia, in light of his official title, enabling him to pronounce that "Climate change requires quick, decisive action" (Thursday Review-Journal).LiNeBrEaKIt is worth noting how the global cooling panic of the 1970s also required such "quick, decisive action." When that scam petered out, we got the global warming panic of the 1990s, which, after 11 years of substantial climate cooling, is turning into a hoax. It was therefore necessary to rename that hoax the present "climate change" flimflam.LiNeBrEaKThe Earth's climate has been changing without any anthropogenic influence for some 3 billion years. Alaska's oil fields, for example, have come about from dense tropical forests that once grew there. Prehistoric and now extinct giant animals ate prodigious quantities of vegetation while roaming the present deserts of the American West.LiNeBrEaKSome 31,794 scientists, with 9,021 doctorates among them, have signed the statement that human activities have not had and will not have in the future any influence on the Earth's climate (search the Internet for "Global Warming Petition Project" and "Manhattan Declaration," among other numerous documents to that effect). And none of us "deniers," the signers of those documents, are in the pay of oil companies, contrary to the calumnies thrown at us by the proponents of this latest "climate change" farce.LiNeBrEaKMarc JericLiNeBrEaKLas VegasLiNeBrEaKShare the roadLiNeBrEaKTo the editor:LiNeBrEaKIn response to Mark Dallas' statement that cars speed by bicyclists on state Route 159, "honking at you like you're in their way," even though there are "Share the Road" signs and painted bike lanes ("Agency to release proposal for Red Rock bike trail," Wednesday Review-Journal):LiNeBrEaKWe're not honking because you're in the way. We are honking to alert you to the fact that we are behind you and we want to make sure you stay in the bike lane and do not cross over into the vehicle lane.LiNeBrEaKAll too often when drivers travel that route, we see side-by-side bikers and we see bikers riding the vehicle lane. With oncoming traffic, this makes for a dangerous situation. LiNeBrEaKSo, Mr. Dallas, try seeing it the way the drivers see it. It's meant as an alert.LiNeBrEaKJeanette NicholsLiNeBrEaKLas VegasLiNeBrEaKAll for the childrenLiNeBrEaKTo the editor:LiNeBrEaKWhen Democrats took control of Congress in 2006, the first female Speaker of the House, Democrat Nancy Pelosi of California, had her grandchildren stand next to her when she said all that we do in the future is for the children.LiNeBrEaKWhy were the children absent at the swearing in of the new Congress? Was it because Speaker Pelosi didn't have the guts to look them in the face after strapping them with trillions of dollars in new debt?LiNeBrEaKDemocrats try to blame President Bush for the cost of the $700 billion bank bailout, but the Democrats control Congress, and in doing so they control the Treasury's purse strings. They could have said no. Now we have President-elect Barack Obama wanting to spend $775 billion on yet another stimulus package. I still remember the one that didn't help last year.LiNeBrEaKMy wife recently read me a quote: "What's the difference between Santa Claus and government? Children ask Santa for presents that are paid for by their parents, but parents ask government for presents to be paid for by their children."LiNeBrEaKIn an unrelated thought, I hope the people of Israel saw the recent poll that says only 31 percent of Democrats approve of Israel's use of force to protect its citizens. I hope Israelis vote for someone who will protect them when President Obama and the Democratic Congress throw them under the bus.LiNeBrEaKRobert GardnerLiNeBrEaKHendersonLiNeBrEaKTime to quitLiNeBrEaKTo the editor:LiNeBrEaKIn response to Scott Kagan's Sunday letter to the editor, "Conservatives too tone deaf to see their own media bias":LiNeBrEaKAt first read of Mr. Kagan's letter, I chuckled thinking he was trying to be humorous. On a second read, however, I realized he was serious, so he deserves a somewhat serious response. Perhaps even a bit of assistance in controlling his habit.LiNeBrEaKAt the outset of his letter, he said it is his habit to turn to the Review-Journal editorial page on a daily basis to determine who on the conservative side is whining the loudest. He also expressed doubt that humor and conservatives can exist together.LiNeBrEaKIn the interest of space and time, I will not attempt to address the other rather off-beat comments in his letter, but I would like to respond to the two indicated above.LiNeBrEaKOne: I would suggest to Mr. Kagan that, considering his attitude and obvious political persuasion, his daily habit is not a good one, especially as it appears to aggravate him. As many of us at the start of the new year make resolutions to kick bad habits, I recommend he quit - cold turkey. Quit reading the Review-Journal and read the opinion/commentary in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post. For video pleasure, watch only CNN, ABC, NBC and Keith Olbermann on MSNBC. For Internet enjoyment, MoveOn.org will do nicely. It's a shame that Al Franken is no longer on radio. This should settle his nerves, and he probably won't hear a lot of whining - only hatred and anger at our current president and slanderous and degrading remarks against the greatest, most generous nation on this earth.LiNeBrEaKTwo: As for conservative humor, see above.

Lubbock Avalanche-Journal (Texas)  	January 10, 2009 Saturday 	Sorghum use urged for ethanol  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	544 words  	Jan. 10--Sorghum producers are hoping to give ethanol distillers a new incentive to choose their grain over corn, which could mean new jobs on the South Plains. LiNeBrEaKNational Sorghum Producers met Wednesday and Thursday in Lubbock where they discussed a tax credit program that would pay ethanol plants to increase their use of sorghum.LiNeBrEaKIf attached to President-elect Barack Obama's stimulus package, the proposal would give a 25-cent-per-gallon credit to certain ethanol producers.LiNeBrEaKTim Lust, CEO of the producers group, said members want to encourage the use of biofuel stock like sorghum to help reduce the environmental consequences of ethanol production.LiNeBrEaK"That would be the goal we're looking at," Lust said, adding credits already exist for the use of certain types of engineered sorghum and biodiesel materials.LiNeBrEaKThe proposal, still under development, requires the growth and harvesting of crops used to create at least 50 percent less greenhouse gases than competing products. Use of fossil fuels in ethanol production also would need to drop 70 percent or more.LiNeBrEaKIt's uncertain whether energy issues will be addressed by the stimulus package, though several options are under consideration, according to a statement from U.S. Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Lubbock.LiNeBrEaKEthanol producers already using high quantities of sorghum, such as the Levelland Hockley County plant, could use the extra money to expand production and hire more employees, said Nick Williams, assistant manager of the plant.LiNeBrEaK"It would be a tremendous advantage," Williams said.LiNeBrEaKExploring new production methods could streamline the distillation process, he said, as well as create new products.LiNeBrEaKStill, even if the proposal makes it into the stimulus package, good planning by farmers would be a large component to having the desired environmental impact, said Jeff Dahlberg, research director for the sorghum group.LiNeBrEaK"Our inherent drought protection in sorghum is probably the biggest environmental impact," Dahlberg said, noting that water management would be in the hands of growers. "Once you get it to the plant, it's pretty much the same."LiNeBrEaKBecause sorghum requires less management than corn, the decreased use of farm equipment would help farmers reach the 50 percent in greenhouse emissions necessary to receive credits.LiNeBrEaKNo matter what the outcome of the proposal, Lust said the emphasis on environmentally friendly production will continue to benefit farmers looking to invest in biofuel crops.LiNeBrEaK"Certainly from a biofuels standpoint, whether it's starch, whether it's sugar, whether it's cellulose, it's part of the solution to lessening our dependence on foreign oil," he said.LiNeBrEaKTo comment on this story:LiNeBrEaKjoshua.hull@lubbockonline.com l 766-8795LiNeBrEaKwalt.nett@lubbockonline.com l 766-8706LiNeBrEaKAGRICULTURE/In Lubbock meeting, growers discuss tax credit program forLiNeBrEaKproducers of biofuel	ALCOHOLS (95%); ETHANOL (94%); BIOFUELS (94%); ETHYL ALCOHOL MFG (92%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (90%); BIOMASS (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); FARMERS and RANCHERS (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (89%); TAX LAW (77%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (75%); DROUGHT (75%); RECRUITMENT and HIRING (73%); AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT (68%); NEW PRODUCTS (64%); US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009 (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (89%)  	BARACK OBAMA (57%); RANDY NEUGEBAUER (55%)  	TEXAS, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (79%)  	January 10, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009    	Joshua Hull, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, Texas  				Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	General  	20090110-QZ-Sorghum-use-urged-for-ethanol-0110  	QZ  														
The Miami Herald (Florida)  	January 10, 2009 Saturday 	Renewable energy gets push in Legislature  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	679 words  	Jan. 10--Florida electric companies would have to rely on an increasingly heavy mix of wind, solar and biomass to generate their power over the next 11 years, under a proposed rule state regulators voted to send to the Legislature late Thursday.LiNeBrEaKCalling their decision "historic," the Florida Public Service Commission unanimously voted to send the Legislature the proposal that calls for 20 percent of their fuel mix to come from renewable energy sources by 2020. They also agreed that consumers could be charged up to 3 percent more in order to jumpstart the market for the clean technologies. LiNeBrEaK"We want to be a leader in this country in solar and wind," said Public Service Commission Chairman Matthew Carter. "We want to establish a dynamic and vibrant marketplace."LiNeBrEaKThe commission's draft rule would require that 75 percent of the renewable energy fee go to finance solar and wind production and 25 percent go to finance biomass production.LiNeBrEaKThe financial incentive is needed, commissioners said, because developing these projects is expensive and they want companies to be willing to build them in Florida.LiNeBrEaKThe Legislature can approve or reject the recommendation before the rule takes effect. The recommendation is only a small piece in a large and complicated debate over how to spark investment into more environmentally-friendly energy sources and reduce Florida's contribution to climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe rule also recommends the following goals:LiNeBrEaK* 7 percent of the fuel used by power companies come from renewable energy sources by 2013, 18 percent by 2019 and 20 percent by 2020;LiNeBrEaK* commissioners will review the goals every three years;LiNeBrEaK* penalties for companies that fail to meet the goals;LiNeBrEaK"We have a long term commitment to it so these industries are going to come to Florida," Carter said. "We're going to have jobs. Florida's going to be a leader and we may even be able to export solar technology to other states...I'm all for leading."LiNeBrEaKThe vote was a victory for Gov. Charlie Crist who first recommended the "20 percent by 2020" standard and won plaudits from the environmental and alternative energy industires. But PSC staff concluded last year that that wasn't achievable until 2041. Florida got 3. 6 percent of its electricity from alternative energy as of 2007, the commission said.LiNeBrEaKThe commission hired a private consulting company, Navigant, to conduct a thorough study and market analysis. Navigant concluded that Florida could reach at least 24 percent of its energy portfolio from renewable energy by 2020 with the right incentives.LiNeBrEaKAt Crist's insistence, the 2008 Florida Legislature authorized the PSC to set the rule, but the Legislature gave itself the authority to approve or reject it. At the heart of the debate is the question of how fast Florida can develop solar and wind power at a reasonable cost to consumers and how much more to allow consumers to be charged to get the new technologies up and running.LiNeBrEaKCommissioner Lisa Edgar said that while she "doesn't generally like carve-outs," it may be necessary to charge customers more money to meet the 2020 goals.LiNeBrEaKCommissioner Nathan Skop agreed: "20 percent by 2020 is an ambitious goal and it's going to take money to get there," he said.LiNeBrEaK"We agree the people of Florida don't want to pay a lot for renewable energy," said Jerry Karnas of the Environmental Defense Fund. "But we also know they want renewable energy and they want a lot of it so the key is how do we get the most renewable energy for the least cost."LiNeBrEaKThe commission also recommended that the Legislature exclude nuclear energy from the 20 percent requirement, something Florida Power and Light and other large utility companies fought hard to get.

D02  	638 words  	Chic shorts  Let's try to be charitable about these corporate tie-insLiNeBrEaKAll the news that's fit to print doesn't always fit in print. The Oregonian's fashion blog, http://blog.oregonlive.com/fashion, is an infinite space for news, tips and whisperings about fashion.LiNeBrEaKVIVIAN McINERNY LiNeBrEaKB eing nice is trendy.LiNeBrEaKIt seems as if every fashion company, whether it's a makeup, clothes or accessory maker, has a charitable tie-in. Buy a lipstick, save the planet. Dress fabulously, fight disease. Carry this bag, stop global warming.LiNeBrEaKIt's easy to dismiss word (I cannot rightfully call it "news") of yet another product designed to raise money for charity. Sure, the nonprofits benefit. But the fashion makers take a big, fat profit in part by tugging at consumers' heartstrings. The whole concept strikes me as Girl Scouts cookies without calories.LiNeBrEaKThen I come to my senses.LiNeBrEaKFashion is a lot like life on fast-forward. Nothing lasts forever --or even more than a few fashion seasons --so why not bask in the loveliness of this trend of generosity?LiNeBrEaKBesides, this bracelet from Brighton is cute and I am, in the Gwen Stefani sense, "just a girl."LiNeBrEaKThe accessory company will offer its limited-edition "Dream Peace" bracelet Jan. 16 through Feb. 14. Brighton will donate $5 of the $55 purchase to the buyer's choice of charities from a select list that includes Women for Women, Physicians for Peace, USA Cares and Action Against Hunger.LiNeBrEaK* Breasts are useful body parts. They feed babies. They launched the bra economy. They keep Hugh Hefner and his Bunny pals from the unemployment line.LiNeBrEaKBut they can also cause undue harm.LiNeBrEaKLeave it to cleavage to distract from anything else a woman might be doing --say, discussing nuclear physics, saving polar bears or picking pockets.LiNeBrEaKCleavage Covers to the rescue!LiNeBrEaKThese handy accessories take the hoochie-koochie out of low-cut tops, wrap dresses and other fashions. The cotton-blend lace thingy stays in place with medical-grade hypoallergenic body tape and extends your wardrobe.LiNeBrEaKRemember dickeys? Those bits of shirt collars or turtlenecks that fit under sweaters without adding bulk? Think of Cleavage Covers as dickeys for your breasts.LiNeBrEaKOr don't.LiNeBrEaKThe point is, they extend your wardrobe. Say you're wearing a head-turning-slashed-down-to-there dress when you get a call from the principal of your kid's school asking you to come in to discuss Junior's behavior. Whip out your Cleavage Covers conveniently stashed in your purse, tape in place and admire the transformation from red-hot mama to concerned parent.LiNeBrEaKIt's a amazing how a little bit of lace can class up a gal.LiNeBrEaKCleavage Covers sell at shops in Ohio and Minnesota, but it would be a crying shame if you had to go to those places just to buy one when they are available online at Cleavage Covers for $19. 99. (Plus shipping and handling, said in a fervent whisper.)LiNeBrEaK* My nephew used to play a lot of video games. Narrow-minded relatives --i.e., me --thought this would surely warp his young brain. Now the kid earns way more money designing tech games than his auntie-of-ye-olde-printed-word will ever see.LiNeBrEaKTwo sisters from Independence probably have a similarly fabulously creative future. Jeni and Kyndi Niquette created a 15-second video for a Clean and Clear contest. Ms. J and K's winning entry is pretty hilarious. To watch the video you'll have to get past the more traditional introduction/commercial announcing their win . . . but it's worth it.LiNeBrEaKMaybe they'll inspire teens to enter this year's video contest, sponsored in part by Clean and Clear. Upload a brief video at CWTV explaining why you deserve to win a walk-on role on the prom episode of "90210." The prize also includes glamour prep for said walk-on; a four-day, three-night trip to California; and a one-year supply of Clean and Clear products.LiNeBrEaKVivian McInerny: 503-294-4076; vmcinerny@news.oregonian.com	FASHION and APPAREL (90%); CHARITIES (90%); FUNDRAISING (78%); WOMEN'S CLOTHING (75%); WOMEN (74%); GLOBAL WARMING (70%); FOOD CHARITIES (69%); CHILDREN (68%); MAMMALS (68%); PHYSICS (50%); PHYSICIANS and SURGEONS (50%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (78%)  	GWEN STEFANI (55%)  		January 11, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  	VIVIAN McINERNY  																					
The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Pennsylvania)  	January 10, 2009 Saturday 	EDITORIAL: Climate change: Melting credibility  	COMMENTARY  	308 words  	Jan. 10--Remember how mankind's abuse of fossil fuels was going to cause the North Pole's ice cap to melt completely in 2008?LiNeBrEaKRemember how the beloved polar bear was in danger of soon becoming extinct because there was too little sea ice from which bears could hunt their favorite dinners of ringed seal pups? LiNeBrEaKIt turns out that both of these global warming scare stories were as full of it as Al Gore's Oscar-winning docu-comedy "An Inconvenient Truth."LiNeBrEaKIt's true that North Pole sea ice had been tracking lower in recent years and throughout much of 2008. But fresh data from the University of Illinois Arctic Climate Research Center show that Arctic sea ice levels -- which have a natural, cyclical habit of expanding, shrinking and thickening -- have rebounded rapidly this winter.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, polar ice is now essentially equal to levels measured in January 1979, when satellites were first used to record data.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, this scientific "surprise" will never get the attention -- or critical analytical spin -- it deserves from the green mainstream media. Nor will the good news about the long-term fortunes of the "imperiled" polar bear be heard by those who need it most -- the nation's brainwashed and unduly alarmed kindergartners.LiNeBrEaKBut with the sea ice's dramatic return, there's no denying that the climate change industry has lost another million square kilometers of its melting credibility.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 10, 2009 Saturday 	The West is hurtling toward a water crisis  	OPINION; Columnists  	608 words  	The Utah Legislature will soon begin its 2009 session, and we may expect bills promoting two favorite pieces of home-grown pork, the Lake Powell pipeline and Transition Power's nuclear nightmare on the Green River.LiNeBrEaKBut before legislators cast more of our recession-stretched cash before these two swine, they should read the latest study of Colorado River issues, James Powell's Dead Pool , from which the following is taken.LiNeBrEaKFor eight years under George W. Bush, the Bureau of Reclamation has refused to acknowledge the effects that global warming is having and will yet have on the Colorado, in spite of record temperatures and the recent 500-year drought that nearly brought Lake Powell to its knees. Instead, the bureau continues to use only data from the last century, the first half of which was one of the wettest periods in the known history of the Colorado. According to Bush's BOR, in 2050 Lake Powell, which reflects the health of the river as a whole, will stand at 3,660 feet, just 40 feet below full pool. LiNeBrEaKStudies done by climate scientists suggest an entirely different future. Recent tree-ring studies have shown that the true multicentury average flow of the river is well below that used by the BOR. They also show periods when river flow, even without the effects of global warming, was lower than that experienced in our 500-year drought.LiNeBrEaKWhen one adds to this natural variability and drought-prone history even a conservative estimate of projected global warming effects, the results are devastating. Current estimates of how much the flow of the Colorado might be reduced range between 6 and 30 percent. Using just a 10-percent figure, and accepting the bureau's own estimates of increased demand and new draws such as the Lake Powell pipeline, Powell gives a harrowing scenario in which Lake Powell drops to "dead pool" by 2022, rendering projects such as the pipeline useless almost as soon as they become operational.LiNeBrEaKBut far scarier is the possibility that in this time frame the effects of the devastation of the Colorado due to overuse and reduced flow could well render life in today's desert megacities such as Phoenix and Las Vegas impossible. What Powell's book shows is that global warming is without any stretch of imagination capable of rendering life in western America unrecognizable not in our grandchildren's lifetime but in ours.LiNeBrEaKWhile I doubt that the 2009 Legislature will take this scenario seriously, there are others in this state who might. No one has more at stake in this crisis-in-the-making than the LDS Church. Let me therefore pose a "morality" question to church leaders.LiNeBrEaKGiven the possibility that the Colorado will not be available for future development in the Mormon heartland, what stance is the church willing to take on growth and conservation in southern Utah? Given the possibility that St. George will have no additional sources of water for future use, and that all sources will be put under climate strain, what is a provident church to do today to prevent future catastrophe?LiNeBrEaKWith such possibilities to consider, the proposition that we will take Colorado River water to run nuclear power plants or to promote continued unsustainable growth in the nation's second-driest state is not only an absurdity. It is cultural genocide.LiNeBrEaKWhat the federal government failed to accomplish in its persecution of the Mormons a century ago, Mormon legislators, county councils, mayors, and developers are visiting on themselves.LiNeBrEaKIn the words of Bernard DeVoto, "The future of the West hinges on whether it can defend itself against itself."LiNeBrEaKEd Firmage Jr. is a fine-art photographer.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	January 10, 2009 Saturday   FINAL EDITION	READER FORUM  	EDITORIAL; Pg. 007  	917 words  	Global warming scare tacticsLiNeBrEaKPhyllis Cuttino's article "Warmer climate is health threat" (Jan. 5) implies warmer temperatures from global warming may cause a malaria epidemic in the United States. If you asked the average person how much has the earth warmed over the past 100 years, most people would have no idea.LiNeBrEaKIf they were told that most scientists agree the Earth has warmed 1 degree Fahrenheit in the last 100 years, what do you think their reaction would be? The projections of higher temperatures in the future are just computer models. LiNeBrEaKThe most amazing part of the article, however, is the concern over malaria. Nearly every environmental organization has opposed the use of DDT (Dichloro-Diphenyl-Trichloroethane) to eradicate malaria, yet Cuttino is worried about a U.S. epidemic.LiNeBrEaKMalaria kills millions in developing countries. Most scientists believe DDT and the benefits of controlling malaria far outweigh any dangers it may pose to humans. Yet scare tactics like Cuttino's article prevent its use, costing millions of lives.LiNeBrEaK- Peter Brennan, Spring Lake Recovery plan doomedLiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama's economic recovery plan ("Obama pushes $300B tax cut to fix 'very sick' economy," Jan. 6) is a perfect example of what is wrong in this country. The same government that caused this economic crisis now expects to fix it by spending hundreds of billions of dollars it doesn't have. Spending money that we did not have is what caused the problem in the first place.LiNeBrEaKThe proposed tax cuts, although welcome to everyone, only deepen the problem. My grandchildren are already going to have to pay for money spent years ago; now my great- grandchildren will be paying for Obama's plan. If the plan includes printing more money, the money we already have will be diminished further by an infusion of worthless paper.LiNeBrEaK- Jarvis Knapp, Hardwick Unions stand in wayLiNeBrEaKAmerica is in very bad shape with the recession upon us. Almost everyone is doing his or her part to make living conditions bearable. Many workers have taken cuts in pay and health benefits in the past year. They are doing without vacations, entertainment or many activities to which they have become accustomed.LiNeBrEaKMost workers have accepted the reality of tough economic times, except for the union workers. These people are outraged they are asked to help get America back on her feet. Their position is indefensible. Everyone else in this country is lowering their standards of living, but unions insist their entitlements not be interrupted or canceled.LiNeBrEaK- Philip Miller, Colts Neck No place for anonymityLiNeBrEaKIn fourth grade I learned one must include his or her name when writing a letter to a publication. Anonymously written letters would surely be discarded.LiNeBrEaKWell, imagine my dismay to discover 10 submissions to the Jan. 8 Reader Forum with no more than silly screen names to identify the writers. These submissions, from njvoices.com, exemplify how the internet has pervaded our lives to the extent that traditional journalism is weakened.LiNeBrEaKRead the fine print at the bottom of your own editorial page: "unsigned submissions will not be used." There is a reason for this rule. An unsigned opinion is worth little.LiNeBrEaK- Paul Starkey, Cranford Too many frills at collegeLiNeBrEaKToday's college curricula remind me of a 500-piece tool set I bought on sale for $250. It looked like a bargain, but I paid for more tools than I ever used.LiNeBrEaKA college student's tuition includes unnecessary expenses that he or she will never use or need. If the powers that be do not reform college spending and make it more affordable for the middle class, only the very wealthy, very athletic and very poor will be able to attend schools of higher learning.LiNeBrEaKA typical student loan today carries an interest of about 7. 6 percent and soon students will lose the option of deferring payments until after graduation, which means they will be forced to work while attending school. That will make it more difficult for the middle class to attend college.LiNeBrEaKBy cutting out semi-professional athletics and other non-educational expenses, tuitions would be drastically reduced. College would be affordable and our county colleges would turn out more scholars and scientists than the private ones.LiNeBrEaK- Thomas Paine Caslander, Jefferson It's still scandalousLiNeBrEaKIsn't it nice that we don't have scandals anymore now that President-elect Barack Obama is taking office? Bill Richardson has to step down as a cabinet-designee because of an investigation into a pay-to-play scandal. This is a "distraction," not a scandal.LiNeBrEaKWhy is this coming out now? Richardson ran for president. Why didn't this come out then?LiNeBrEaKThe governor of Illinois allegedly tried to sell Obama's Senate seat, and here is yet another non-scandal - the media calls it "an unfortunate distraction" to Obama. Nevermind that Obama has been a staunch supporter and close ally of Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Nevermind that Obama's chief of staff had given a list of appointees to the seat that would be acceptable to Obama. It's a good thing this isn't a "scandal" either!LiNeBrEaK- Suzanne Greydanus, Bloomfield Pension rouletteLiNeBrEaKGov. Jon Corzine wants to declare a pension holiday for the state's municipalities, allowing them to contribute only 50 percent of their legal obligation to the pension fund.LiNeBrEaKIf I did the same thing on my credit cards, the lending institutions would call me delinquent. If I declared a mortgage holiday, I'd be greeted with foreclosure notices.LiNeBrEaKIt's nice to be governor - almost as good as being king.LiNeBrEaK- Alex Zecca, Brick	MALARIA (93%); GLOBAL WARMING (92%); TROPICAL DISEASES (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); DISEASES and DISORDERS (90%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (77%); RECESSION (77%); ECONOMIC NEWS (77%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (74%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (74%); ECONOMIC RECOVERY (71%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (71%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (71%); SCIENCE NEWS (71%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (68%); TAXES and TAXATION (68%); TAX LAW (66%); TAX RELIEF (66%); LABOR UNIONS (66%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (50%)  	BARACK OBAMA (69%)  	EARTH (92%); NEW JERSEY, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 10, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Newark Morning Ledger Co.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 	January 10, 2009 Saturday   4 State / Suncoast Edition	FORGET NUCLEAR POWER, LET'S GO SOLAR  	NATIONAL; YOUR LETTERS; Pg. 13A  	2062 words  	Meeting Florida's energy needsLiNeBrEaKThere is debate about whether to postpone raising the rates of Progress Energy customers. After reading Asjylyn Loder's article Gainesville utility places premium on solar power (Jan. 2), it appears that there are alternatives to building a new nuclear plant. Nuclear is an overpriced, outmoded option to produce electricity. Yes, the carbon emissions, the primary cause of global warming, are minimized, but the costs of construction and disposal of nuclear waste are too great.LiNeBrEaKEd Regan, an official with Gainesville Regional Utilities, traveled to Germany to see why that country is today a leader in solar power. He is instrumental in putting in place in Gainesville the same kind of system Germany uses. Through the use of solar feed-in tariffs, businesses and residential customers are actually paid a premium for the excess electricity they produce and sell back to the utility. In this way, the high price of solar for these early adopters is mitigated and banks are more willing to finance the investment.LiNeBrEaKThe cost to do this is spread among all customers: $2. 50 per customer per month in Germany, and about 40 cents per customer per month in Gainesville. That sure beats the surcharge of $11. 42 per 1,000 kilowatt hours Progress Energy is going to be charging in advance for building a nuclear plant. LiNeBrEaKSolar power would provide jobs and eliminate the conundrum of what to do with the nuclear waste. Surely Tampa Electric and Progress Energy, with the oversight of the Public Service Commission, could study this issue and move toward implementing what Gainesville has started. Los Angeles followed Gainesville's lead and adopted feed-in tariffs. Public service commissioner Nathan Skop recently proposed a similar measure. It's time to take the new nuclear plant off the table and study the economic viability of solar power with feed-in tariffs.LiNeBrEaKLinda Lowe, BrandonLiNeBrEaKIgnorant critics limit energy supplyJan. 7, letterLiNeBrEaKConsider thermal pollutionLiNeBrEaKThe letter writer has a point. America did once lead the world in nuclear power due to its awesome engineering prowess. However, the writer never mentioned the huge problem of thermal pollution associated with all nuclear and fossil fuel electric power generation. Some 20 percent of all global warming is attributable to waste heat from thermal electric power generation and other waste heat sources such as the internal combustion engine.LiNeBrEaKFor every BTU that gets turned into a kilowatt hour of electricity two BTUs must be dispersed into a body of water or into the atmosphere. Why further heat up our bays and rivers with waste heat? Is it our goal to fry the planet?LiNeBrEaKAmerica needs to put what is left of our hollowed-out engineering might into photovoltaic electric power generation. There is no thermal pollution in generating electric power from photovoltaic arrays coupled with phase change storage media of molten salts or compressed air for nighttime electricity production. Photovoltaic electric power generation is feasible and can be made very economical (See Scientific American, Jan. 2008).LiNeBrEaKLastly the writer doesn't mention that the decommissioning cost of a nuclear power plant is maybe two to three times the initial installed cost. Why worry, just let our great-grandkids pay. It's the ultimate free-market answer to all our power problems: kick the problem down the road.LiNeBrEaKKen Fiallos P.E., SeffnerLiNeBrEaKCosts add upLiNeBrEaKThanks to the Florida Legislature, Progress Energy is now charging us 25 percent more to cover increased fuel costs and to build a nuclear plant, which won't be finished for years.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately the gross receipts tax, municipal franchise fee and municipal utility tax are based on percentages of the total bill, therefore we need to add an even greater percentage to our bills for taxes and fees.LiNeBrEaKBurt Kauffman, St. PetersburgLiNeBrEaKBalancing the state budgetLiNeBrEaKBuy time with a temporary increase in the sales taxLiNeBrEaKFlorida legislators are trying to find a way to balance the state budget before the end of this month's special session. Though they are trying to avoid the introduction of a general increase in taxes, they should consider a bill that imposes a temporary quarter of a cent raise in sales taxes, which would sunset at the end of a year. This will not only help balance our state budget, but also give state officials time to critically analyze our state expenditures and make thoughtful, well-planned adjustments.LiNeBrEaKBy next year the newly elected state and federal agents will have had an opportunity to negotiate certain financial aid packages for programs such as Medicaid. Decisions to cut certain services or borrow from state trust funds pre-empt a possible increase in federal funds to the state.LiNeBrEaKMy proposal will buy legislators more time, not unlimited time. The quarter of a cent raise in sales tax imposes a small burden without targeting one specific group or program. Another benefit is that a lot of the funds needed to balance the budget will come from out-of-state pockets.LiNeBrEaKUnder most circumstances I would be opposed to an increase in sales tax, even a minimal increase on a temporary basis, but these are not ordinary times, and considering the alternatives, I believe this is our best option.LiNeBrEaKMichael Steinberg, TampaLiNeBrEaKBudget plans lack vision, add pain - Jan. 9, editorialLiNeBrEaKBoost tax on alcoholLiNeBrEaKAgain I am subjected to one of your shortsighted ways to raise revenue to cover state shortfalls. This shortfall problem has been experienced many times over the past decade and one of suggested methods of raising revenue has always been to raise cigarette taxes.LiNeBrEaKNot only is this a tax on a minority of our population, but these individuals also are being taxed with little consideration for the other taxes they are paying. A broader-based tax and one that would fill state coffers immediately would be an increased tax on alcohol.LiNeBrEaKAlcohol consumption and/or abuse causes far more social problems than those caused by smokers. The time has come to spread any increase in taxes across a wider population of consumers, namely alcohol consumers, than again targeting an already declining segment of the population - smokers.LiNeBrEaKDouglas Robb, TampaLiNeBrEaKInternet sales taxLiNeBrEaKTax would be a fatal blowLiNeBrEaKMany people feel that the lack of sales tax on the Internet is unfair. However, what is being proposed is even more unfair, and would kill Internet shopping. Brick-and-mortar stores charge sales tax based on where they are located. They are responsible for at most one state sales tax, one county sales tax, one city sales tax. Any changes to these taxes are communicated well ahead of time to those who collect these taxes.LiNeBrEaKWhat is generally proposed for Internet sales, however, is collecting sales tax based, not on where the Internet store is based, but on where each customer lives. This means that the Internet store is responsible for 50-plus state and territory taxes, hundreds of county taxes, and thousands of city taxes. And this does not even account for those customers who live in other countries. Many of these taxing authorities also have different rates for different items at different times of the year.LiNeBrEaKIf we are indeed pushing for a tax on Internet sales, then let's be fair. Use the same policy for all stores, regardless of how they contact their customers. If I were to buy from a small store in Maine via the mail, I would not be expected to add sales tax to the purchase. So why should I be expected to do this for Internet purchases?LiNeBrEaKLee Creel, TampaLiNeBrEaKLook to gamblingLiNeBrEaKLast Sunday's St. Petersburg Times presented an interesting juxtaposition. There was a massive ad touting the new Florida Powerball - which would be added to the other legalized games of chance the state offers. There was also the front-page article on how we have a massive tax revenue shortfall in Florida with no idea how we're going to bridge that gap (Florida, this is going to hurt).LiNeBrEaKThe answer seems very simple: Legalize gambling (slots, cards, craps) and open state-sanctioned casinos. Gambling is gambling!LiNeBrEaKIn the past, the Times has come out against legalized gambling. The nannyist arguments your paper has served up about gambling preying on those who can least afford it or increasing crime or compulsive gambling don't hold water if you look at how things are run at the Hard Rock casino or other Indian sponsored casinos. It's funny how Nevada doesn't have a tax revenue problem every year but we do. They are a tourist/vacation destination and so is Florida. It's a good match to encourage increased tourism.LiNeBrEaKIts time for the Times and our Legislature to support legalizing the other forms of gambling (slots, cards, craps) in a controlled state-run environment and use the proceeds to fund the state tax coffers.LiNeBrEaKDavid Gliewe, ClearwaterLiNeBrEaKRethink role in MideastLiNeBrEaKThe recent resumption of hostilities between Israel and the Arabs (this time in the form of Hamas) should be an invitation to Americans to reconsider our long-range commitments to the Middle East. Since Israel's birth in 1947 the country has constantly been in conflict with one or more of the surrounding Arab countries and territories.LiNeBrEaKAt least since the 1960s, various American administrations have tried to negotiate peace between Israel and the Arabs. Over the past several decades, we have given subsidies of some $3-billion per year to both Israel and Egypt, and undisclosed millions to the Fatah party of the Palestinian Authority. These efforts have been fruitless because the belligerents refuse to embrace the compromises necessary to bring about a lasting peace.LiNeBrEaKThe outline of such a peace is clear to anyone familiar with the conflict. Arabs must recognize that their ancestral lands seized by Israel after its war of independence are lost forever. And Arab states must be willing to guarantee Israel's right to exist, and suppress violent factions within their countries that seek to overthrow the Jewish state. On Israel's side, it must withdraw from all the territories taken in the 1967 war, including the entire West Bank and the Golan Heights, and agree to the redivision of Jerusalem, with Palestinians controlling the East, Israel controlling the West, and the holy places under international control. Until both sides agree to these significant compromises, there will be no peace.LiNeBrEaKWhat should be America's role? It is in our national interest to withdraw completely, taking our subsidies, our weapons systems, and our diplomats with us. If Israel and the Arabs, now facing one another without American mediation, signal a willingness to negotiate these painful compromises, we could offer our good offices, but not until we can see the distinct possibility of a lasting settlement.LiNeBrEaKTerry Parssinen, Ph.D, professor of history, University of TampaLiNeBrEaKPalestinian silenceLiNeBrEaKWhat I haven't seen in the opinion pages and letters to the editor regarding Israel and Gaza over the last few years since Israel pulled out of Gaza is any Palestinian outrage over the rockets fired indiscriminately into Israel directly at civilian areas. I haven't seen Palestinian supporters who are outraged that U.N. buildings are being used as weapons storage and factories, deliberately endangering women and children.LiNeBrEaKNo one is outraged that Palestinian leaders and Hamas are openly calling for "human shields" to surround and protect those who are the leaders, the rocket launchers, or to surround the schools and hospitals where they run to hide after firing rockets.LiNeBrEaKThese appeals are shown in Arabic on al-Aqsa TV, on ANB TV-Lebanon and on various Palestinian Web sites. That's how the civilians know where to run to. These are war crimes. Those who stand silently by are just as guilty of war crimes as those who actually commit them. Israel, on the other hand, warns civilians of impending attack.LiNeBrEaKSusan Segal, Palm HarborLiNeBrEaKRussia stars at nights - Jan. 1LiNeBrEaKAn exploited animalLiNeBrEaKI cannot express how dismayed I am by the review of Russian Accents restaurant and the exploitation of a bear for profit.

Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, Virginia)  	January 10, 2009 Saturday 	Company seeks to build energy plant fueled by landfill's fumes  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	738 words  	Jan. 10--SUFFOLK -- A chemical company wants to build a $26 million "green energy" plant on its property off Wilroy Road that would utilize methane gas mined from beneath the regional landfill in Suffolk.LiNeBrEaKIf approved by the Suffolk City Council later this month, the project would be the first cogeneration energy plant in Virginia fueled by landfill gas, generating both electricity and steam from rotting garbage. LiNeBrEaKThe city's Planning Commission last month unanimously approved the project, which would power nearly all operations at Ciba Special ty Chemicals in North Suffolk and also provide energy for about 3,000 homes, according to company plans.LiNeBrEaK"This is a fabulous opportunity for the city of Suffolk and a wonderful investment for Ciba," Beth Earnst, a company spokeswoman, said Friday.LiNeBrEaKIt also could be a boon for the Southeastern Public Service Authority, which owns the regional landfill and is struggling to keep its financial head above water.LiNeBrEaKCiba has received methane gas from the landfill for about eight years through a 3-mile pipeline and pays SPSA an annual royalty of about $230,000.LiNeBrEaKThe developer of the new project, GPC Green Energy LLC, which would build and operate the power plant for Ciba, estimates that SPSA would get about $3. 5 million a year under the deal.LiNeBrEaKSPSA, however, has not signed a gas contract yet. Negotiations are continuing, said Tom Kreidel, an SPSA spokesman, and "hopefully should be completed soon."LiNeBrEaKWhile the various parties have been discussing the terms since last fall, Kreidel said, the process has taken so long because, in part, SPSA is required to follow government contracting protocols.LiNeBrEaKThe timing is making some people with the project antsy.LiNeBrEaK"As soon as SPSA can agree to supply or commit the landfill gas to our project, we are 30 to 36 weeks away from turning the switch," said Skip Smith, GPC Green Energy's project manager. "We are ready to go, except for the SPSA commitment."LiNeBrEaKMethane for years was strictly a nuisance. It has an uncanny ability to seep through cracks and into buildings and, at times, can explode. It also is considered a greenhouse gas that, when released into the atmosphere, is thought to contribute to climate change.LiNeBrEaKIn recent years, though, landfill operators and energy entrepreneurs have teamed up to mine and sell methane gas, which forms naturally amid buried garbage.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, there are 20 landfill-gas-to-energy projects in Virginia today, and another 12 in line as candidates. The city of Virginia Beach operates such a project at its Mount Trashmore II landfill, and SPSA has done the same since the mid-1990s.LiNeBrEaKBut Virginia has no cogeneration plants fueled by landfill gas, according to EPA statistics, which makes the Ciba project especially exciting to its backers.LiNeBrEaKAmong the benefits, organizers say: The cogeneration plant would reduce Ciba's use of fossil fuels; would cut air pollutants at the regional landfill and at Ciba's chemical facility; would provide Suffolk with more clean power for its residents; and would allow Ciba to market its products as manufactured by green energy.LiNeBrEaK"It's a win-win-win solution," said Smith, whose company is based in Silver Spring, Md., and has experience with other landfill-gas plants, including one in Armenia.LiNeBrEaKThe plant would be built within a soundproof wall on the Ciba campus in Suffolk, at 2301 Wilroy Road. It would route the gas through compressors, freeze it, cleanse it, mix it with natural gas, and burn it for energy.LiNeBrEaKThe resulting heat would be captured and converted to steam, which also would be used at Ciba, according to plans and officials.LiNeBrEaKTwelve high-tech jobs would be created by the plant, which also would require about $2 million a year in upkeep and maintenance expenses and cost about $26 million to construct, officials said.LiNeBrEaKThe Suffolk City Council is scheduled to vote on a conditional-use permit for the project at its next meeting on Jan. 21.LiNeBrEaKScott Harper, (757) 446-2340, scott.harper@pilotonline.com	LANDFILLS (93%); CHEMICALS (91%); POWER PLANTS (90%); METHANE (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (90%); CHEMICALS MFG (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); CITIES (89%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (89%); POWER COGENERATION (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (89%); LAND USE PLANNING (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (78%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (78%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (78%); APPROVALS (77%); CITY GOVERNMENT (77%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (77%); PUBLIC CONTRACTING (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); CONTRACTS and BIDS (74%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (73%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (72%); PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION (72%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (72%); CITY LIFE (72%); PROCESS STEAM UTILITIES (71%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (69%)  		VIRGINIA BEACH, VA, USA (72%) VIRGINIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 12, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Virginian-Pilot   	Scott Harper, The Virginian-Pilot, Norfolk, Va.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	January 10, 2009 Saturday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	'Environmentalist' protects oceans 'Environmentalist' Bush protects oceans  	LOCAL; Pg. B7  	514 words  	TO THOSE of us who have found little to cheer about in the George W. Bush presidency, the chance to holler unhedged hosannas over the protection he has granted nearly 200,000 square miles of the Pacific Ocean is alluring. Even the considerable pleasures of surliness are dimmed when practiced without cease. LiNeBrEaKAlas, the president's larger and appalling environmental record does not allow for such unhesitating approbation . Bush, however, did a very large good when he reached back to a 1906 statute for authority to set three huge expanses of the Pacific aside from commercial exploitation.LiNeBrEaKCombined with the nearly 140,000 square miles of ocean in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands that he similarly protected in 2006, the program makes this president, oddly, a champion conservationist and a world pioneer in recognizing the need to protect our sustaining oceans.LiNeBrEaK"Oddly" because otherwise Bush has been pretty much a one-man environmental disaster.LiNeBrEaKCrucially, he took office dismissing global warming as only a leftist scam against capitalism. Bush removed the United States from the then-forming international efforts to reduce emissions of the implicated greenhouse gases. Even when he finally acknowledged the phenomenon after giving it a new name of political convenience -- climate change -- Bush resisted the policy imperatives that would come of admitting a human cause.LiNeBrEaKBush appointees in the Environmental Protection Agency and Interior Department suppressed or even rewrote scientific findings to suit the administration's ideological dispositions and its favored industries. To scant public notice, the administration has put oil and gas leases on auction in vast, ecologically sensitive and -- at places -- exquisitely beautiful federal tracts of the West.LiNeBrEaKBush and crew opened previously shielded offshore areas to oil exploration; loosened restraints on mountain top strip mining; harried endangered species; undermined environmental impact reviews; and were only recently stopped by public outcry from allowing paved roads into national forests for housing developments.LiNeBrEaKYet this self-same president has now taken an extraordinary step on behalf of the planet. OK, so the ocean presents no great countervailing lobbies -- timber, fossil fuel, development. The president only had to buck sport fishermen, who will now have to be licensed, and of course Dick Cheney, who is against ... well, just about any niceness.LiNeBrEaKEven if politically easy for him, Bush's action will protect an astonishing array of aquatic life and such remarkable features as the Mariana Trench, the world's deepest canyon. And it is a heritage that potentially could grow.LiNeBrEaKBush spread the protections 50 miles from the coastlines of the numerous Pacific islands that are U.S. possessions. Washington has the authority to cast a 200-mile mantle, and the Obama administration, which will be far more environmentally inclined from the get-go, would do well to study the yeas and nays of that option.LiNeBrEaKTom Teepen is a columnist for Cox Newspapers.

In "Mr. Kaine's Budget" [editorial, Dec. 29], you made the remarkable assertion that Virginia's $77 billion biennial budget was "lean." Lean? The budget for the current fiscal year calls for spending $35. 6 billion, or about $4,600 for every man, woman and child in the commonwealth. This, of course, does not include local spending. I guess one person's "lean" is another person's bloated. No wonder many of us believe that we are already overtaxed.LiNeBrEaKI wasn't able to find an analysis of how a 30-cent boost in cigarette taxes would increase revenue by $150 million, but I'd be willing to take the under on that bet.

Yakima Herald-Republic (Washington)  	January 10, 2009 Saturday 	EDITORIAL: Throwing around money won't fix the current financial crisis  	COMMENTARY  	745 words  	Jan. 10--This editorial appears in the Yakima Herald-Republic on Jan. 9, 2009LiNeBrEaKUnlike global warming, folks from every spot on the political spectrum agree on this: The American economy is facing one of the most severe -- if not the most severe -- economic downturns since the Great Depression of the 1920s and '30s.LiNeBrEaKWhat's much less clear is whether the U.S. government should go out and spend hundreds of billions of dollars (or more) to get us out of this financial mess -- or at least keep the situation from getting worse. LiNeBrEaKOddly, outgoing President George W. Bush and President-elect Barack Obama seem to be singing from the same hymnal on this issue. Bush and his political advisers in recent months have sought and received congressional support for a more than $700 billion financial bailout package for troubled banks, investment firms and insurance companies and they've sought billions more to help U.S. automakers avoid collapse. Now comes Obama and his economic team, who are shopping around a broader economic stimulus package that could cost taxpayers $800 billion more (and that's before Congress adds on its pet programs).LiNeBrEaKWe suppose we should be comforted by the fact that Bush's Republican economic gurus and Obama's Democratic mavens agree that massive infusions of federal dollars are just the tonic needed to put the ailing U.S. financial system on the road to recovery.LiNeBrEaKWe are not.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps another colossal stimulus package does represent economic penicillin, but we are having real trouble getting past the feeling that the physicians prescribing and approving these "cures" should be spending a lot more time diagnosing the diseases and figuring the best course of treatment -- not the most expedient or politically popular ones.LiNeBrEaKWe need look no further back than Bush and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's $700 billion financial bailout package for an example of how not to handle the next government Rx. Paulson's hastily drafted plan zipped through a too-eager-to-help Congress with barely a raised eyebrow and it was only after those funds started to be handed out like ballgame giveaways that everyone realized they meant a lot to the health of executives' bank accounts but did little to perk up the credit or mortgage markets.LiNeBrEaKSo, what lesson did Obama learn from this? None that we can see.LiNeBrEaKAs he has started to unveil elements of his plan this month, the president-elect has been light on details but heavy on urgency, saying he hopes Congress will act right away on his plan and give him something he can sign into law within days of his inauguration later this month.LiNeBrEaKSay it ain't so.LiNeBrEaKWhile we can buy into the notion that massive investments in things like alternative fuel development, transportation and other infrastructure projects will eventually put thousands and maybe even millions back to work and, therefore, jumpstart the economy, the impact of such efforts won't be felt for months or even years.LiNeBrEaKAnd if that's the case, what's needed most urgently now isn't congressional action, it's congressional (and media and policy analyst and public) scrutiny and debate. The most important thing Obama can do is put every element of his administration-in-waiting's economic plan on the Internet and invite everyone to have a look. Let it be examined and commented upon by whoever wants to speak up.LiNeBrEaKCongress should do what it does best: Hold hearings. And Obama's team should stand ready to tweak or even overhaul the plan when the inevitable clunker elements get unearthed.LiNeBrEaKThen, and only then, should Congress act and Obama be prepared to sign on the dotted line.LiNeBrEaKFor once, let's not take the "ready, fire, aim" approach to solving an American crisis. Better no package at all than one borne of too much emphasis on action and not enough on thoughtful preparation.LiNeBrEaKTo use Obama's words from an earlier speech on the topic, we need "deliberate action" ... with an emphasis on deliberate.LiNeBrEaK--Members of the Yakima Herald-Republic editorial board are Michael Shepard, Barbara Serrano, Spencer Hatton and Karen Troianello.

Albuquerque Journal (New Mexico)  	January 9, 2009 Friday 	La Nina Makes an Entrance: Heavy Snowpack Will Blunt Effects  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	337 words  	Jan. 9--La Nina, the climate pattern that brings dry weather to the Southwest, is back, federal forecasters say, but, in the months leading up to its arrival, we have built an enormous snowpack to help us through the coming months. LiNeBrEaKAccording to Ed Polasko with the National Weather Service, winter can be a "crapshoot" in terms of wet-dry patterns, while late winter and spring is when La Nina's effects usually kick in.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile:LiNeBrEaKn The federal government's Climate Prediction Center announced Thursday that La Nina, a cooling of the equatorial Pacific, has officially arrived. La Nina has a tendency to steer the jet stream, which brings winter storms, to the north.LiNeBrEaKn The winter snowpack that built up in November and December is impressively large, according to Polasko. Places like Chama, Tierra Amarilla and El Vado in northern New Mexico are at or near record snow levels for this time of year. At Chamita, a snow measuring station in the mountains above Chama, the snow is 3 feet deep. Snow pack in the Rio Chama basin is 84 percent above normal.LiNeBrEaKn In southwest New Mexico, snow levels are not as high, but are still averaging 25 percent above normal, according to Polasko.LiNeBrEaKn Final 2008 precipitation numbers, published this week by the National Climatic Data Center, show the year just completed was, for New Mexico, about as average as a year can be. While total precipitation numbers varied in different parts of the state, the statewide average number of 13. 5 inches of precipitation almost exactly matches the long term average for New Mexico, according to the federal climate recordkeeping agency.

C1  	266 words  	La Ni&ntilde;a, the climate pattern that brings dry weather to the Southwest, is back, federal forecasters say, but, in the months leading up to its arrival, we have built an enormous snowpack to help us through the coming months. LiNeBrEaKAccording to Ed Polasko with the National Weather Service, winter can be a "crapshoot" in terms of wet-dry patterns, while late winter and spring is when La Ni&ntilde;a's effects usually kick in.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile:LiNeBrEaKn The federal government's Climate Prediction Center announced Thursday that La Ni&ntilde;a, a cooling of the equatorial Pacific, has officially arrived. La Ni&ntilde;a has a tendency to steer the jet stream, which brings winter storms, to the north.LiNeBrEaKn The winter snowpack that built up in November and December is impressively large, according to Polasko. Places like Chama, Tierra Amarilla and El Vado in northern New Mexico are at or near record snow levels for this time of year. At Chamita, a snow measuring station in the mountains above Chama, the snow is 3 feet deep. Snow pack in the Rio Chama basin is 84 percent above normal.LiNeBrEaKn In southwest New Mexico, snow levels are not as high, but are still averaging 25 percent above normal, according to Polasko.LiNeBrEaKn Final 2008 precipitation numbers, published this week by the National Climatic Data Center, show the year just completed was, for New Mexico, about as average as a year can be. While total precipitation numbers varied in different parts of the state, the statewide average number of 13. 5 inches of precipitation almost exactly matches the long term average for New Mexico, according to the federal climate recordkeeping agency.

Beaver County Times (Pennsylvania)  	January 9, 2009 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Running on empty: Dropping oil prices could create problems for Venezuela and others  	COMMENTARY  	450 words  	Jan. 9--Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's decision to restore a program that provides free home heating oil to poor Americans shows the importance of energy conservation and the development of renewable sources of energy. LiNeBrEaKOn Monday, Citgo, the Venezuelan government's Texas-based subsidiary, announced it was suspending the program because of falling oil prices and the worldwide economic crisis.LiNeBrEaKOn Wednesday, Chavez, a socialist who frequently attacks capitalism and the United States. reversed that decision.LiNeBrEaK"Chavez is trying to save face," Dennis Jett, a former American ambassador who's now a professor of international affairs at Penn State University, told McClatchy Newspapers. "He decided he needs to hide the fact that he's having a cash crisis."LiNeBrEaKIndeed, he is.LiNeBrEaKThe news service reported Venezuelan oil, which is a lower grade than conventional crude and trades at a lower price, peaked at $126 a barrel in July and now sells for about $40 a barrel. About 93 percent of Venezuela's export revenue comes from oil sales, mostly to the United States.LiNeBrEaKThe impact of falling oil prices isn't limited to Chavez's pet project or the United States. It also has domestic implications for oil-producing countries like Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Libya, etc.LiNeBrEaKThe lower the price of oil, the less money these often unpopular regimes have to buy off domestic discontent by heavily subsidizing food, energy, housing and other basics.LiNeBrEaKIn effect, they are using our money to buy themselves peace on the home front. (Lower oil prices also give Iran less money to subsidize terrorist organizations like Hamas.)LiNeBrEaKThat's why energy conservation and the development of green, renewable sources of energy are about more than curbing global warming and Americans feeling good about ourselves.LiNeBrEaKNational security also is at stake.LiNeBrEaKBy denying American dollars to Iran, Venezuela, Libya and other nations with anti-American agendas, we would be making the world safer for the United States and its allies, while at the same time making it a more perilous place domestically for those nations that do not have our best interests at heart.LiNeBrEaKWhy can't those who sneer at the idea of energy conservation and development of renewable energy to reduce our dependence on imported oil grasp that essential point?

Buffalo News (New York) 	January 9, 2009 Friday   CENTRAL EDITION	Bush improves legacy;  Creation of huge ocean reserves is a great gift to the future 	EDITORIAL PAGE; Pg. A6  	518 words  	Given his stated fatalism over his place in history and his long-demonstrated unconcern for most environmental matters, there seems but one reason why President George W. Bush would approach the end of his administration by designating 195,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments. LiNeBrEaKHe must really think it is the right thing to do.LiNeBrEaKIt was.LiNeBrEaKThere could easily be quibbles about how he could and should have done more, and should have shown equal concern for protecting the dry land of the continental United States. But the fact is that by invoking his sole power under the federal Antiquities Act, creating three separate ocean reserves in the remote Pacific Ocean this week and another two years ago, Bush has arguably protected a larger share of the earth than any other person in history.LiNeBrEaKHe deserves great credit for that.LiNeBrEaKThe Antiquities Act of 1906 is a legacy of Theodore Roosevelt, another Republican president who was not shy about exercising unchecked executive power to save large swaths of territory from development and destruction. While the overwhelming majority of the environmental community might gag at the thought of positively comparing W. with T.R., conservationist groups were generous with their praise of Bush's latest actions.LiNeBrEaKExtending Antiquities Act protection to the three areas -- labeled the Mariana Trench and Islands, the Central Pacific Islands and the tiny Rose Atoll of American Samoa -- Bush has put off-limits to mining, drilling and most forms of fishing a total area larger than that of the state of California. And that is on top of the 139,000-square-mile Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands designated two years ago.LiNeBrEaKThe various atolls, reefs, islands and underwater canyons and mountain ranges now covered -- 334,000 square miles in all -- will provide necessary shelter for hundreds of rare and endangered species. Protecting biodiversity in this and other ways not only provides a treasure trove of scientific data, but also stands to mute the impact of global climate change as the great ocean biospheres are protected.LiNeBrEaKIn notable contrast to the many other environmental policy decisions made over the past eight years, Bush's maritime reserves were selected, refined, created and approved based on hard scientific data, both from within the government and from independent organizations such as the Pew Environment Group and Environmental Defense.LiNeBrEaKIt also appears that Bush had little industrial push-back on the ocean reserves, given that their remote locations already had them far outside any drillers' or despoiler's cross-hairs. Still, that same out-of-sightness would have allowed the president to just walk away from the issue with very little outcry from any but the most committed activists.LiNeBrEaKThe historians of the next 50 or 100 years may yet judge Bush harshly on issues from war and peace to taxes and deficits. But, thanks to his apparently unforced concern for these portions of the Pacific Ocean, the historians of the next 150 to 500 years may view him much more positively. This will be a lasting legacy.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 9, 2009 Friday 	Minnesota's iconic moose are dying off, and scientists eye climate change  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	1021 words  	CHICAGO _ It wasn't long ago that thousands of moose roamed the gentle terrain of northwestern Minnesota, affirming the iconic status of the antlered, bony-kneed beast from the North Woods. In just two decades, though, their numbers have plummeted, from 4,000 to fewer than a hundred.LiNeBrEaKThey didn't move away. They just died. LiNeBrEaKThe primary culprit in what is known as the moose mystery, scientists say, is climate change, which has systematically reduced the Midwest's already dwindling moose population and provoked alarm in Minnesota, where wildlife specialists gathered for a "moose summit" last month in Duluth.LiNeBrEaK"There's not a lot of opportunity to turn this around," said Mark Lenarz, a wildlife research specialist at the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. "Here in Minnesota, they (moose) have been weakened by climate change."LiNeBrEaKTemperatures tell much of the story. Over the past 40 years in northwest Minnesota, the average winter temperature has risen significantly _ 12 degrees _ while summers are 4 degrees warmer. Solitary and temperamentally grumpy, moose have made it clear in their estimated 13,000 years in North America that they hate warm weather.LiNeBrEaKThe mounting concern about the fate of the moose comes as the Bush administration is revising endangered species regulations in ways that prohibit federal agencies from evaluating the effects of increased global warming on endangered species.LiNeBrEaKOfficially, the moose is not endangered in the United States. But it is in danger of disappearing from the Midwest, which is the far southern fringe of its range. Roughly 7,700 moose reside in Minnesota, nearly all in the northeast section of the state. That's a drop of almost 50 percent in the last 20 years.LiNeBrEaKIsle Royale National Park, a 45-mile-long island in western Lake Superior, has about 650 moose, down from 2,500 in 1995. Michigan's sparsely populated Upper Peninsula has about 450, and that population has remained steady, according to a wildlife biologist at the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.LiNeBrEaK"The trends for the past 20 years are pretty clear, and if they keep up there won't be any moose in 50 years," said John Vucetich, a population biologist at Michigan Technological University in Houghton.LiNeBrEaKOne of the many questions raised by the demise of the moose is, "What does it mean if the moose go away?"LiNeBrEaKIt's not as if the moose leaving Minnesota and Michigan would upset a delicate ecological balance that would occur with, say, a dramatic falloff of the bird population that would allow insects to proliferate.LiNeBrEaK"That's the $64,000 question," Vucetich said. "As the climate warms, some creatures will do better, some worse. For moose it's fairly straightforward that we'll lose them ... and there are a lot of people who identify with moose."LiNeBrEaKThat identity, from wooden carvings to giant polystyrene moose next to roadside restaurants, helps define the region's image.LiNeBrEaK"They're a symbol of the great north, of wilderness, and a lot of people would not want to see that go away," Vucetich said.LiNeBrEaKAll romantic symbolism aside, the beasts are in big trouble.LiNeBrEaKMinnesota and Michigan offer separate living laboratories that help explain why the moose are dying. Heat, water and parasites play important roles, but temperatures are the trigger. While deer, wolves and bears have adapted to warmer temperatures, wildlife biologists say, the moose have suffered. Moose require shade, water and cool weather, each of which is dwindling in northwest Minnesota.LiNeBrEaKLenarz said the moose population in the northwestern part of Minnesota struggles among small patches of aspen woods and farmland.LiNeBrEaKWhen temperatures rise, the moose have to work harder to obtain food and find places to stay cool. Lenarz said that affects their immune systems, prevents them from putting on more fat in the summertime (which they need to get through the winter) and makes them vulnerable to infestations from parasites.LiNeBrEaKAlthough northeastern Minnesota is comparatively more moose-friendly _ greater shade, more opportunities to cool off _ the population is declining, albeit more gradually, by 10 percent to 13 percent per year. Lenarz said the pregnancy rate is a little more than half the norm for moose, and mortality rates are two to three times higher than the average.LiNeBrEaKHunting is not a significant factor. It is banned in northwest Minnesota and limited to 150 _ bulls only _ in the northeast.LiNeBrEaKHeading north to cooler climes is not an option.LiNeBrEaK"When moose are in trouble, they don't move. They die," said Rolf Peterson, a research professor at Michigan Tech and the chairman of the Minnesota Moose Advisory Committee.LiNeBrEaKPeterson has spent decades studying the interrelationship between moose and wolves, the only big animals on Isle Royale. Moose on the isolated island are not exposed to many of the threats from Minnesota _ cars, hunters and multiple parasites usually carried by deer. Wolves are the predators. Yet a decade-long trend of hotter-than-normal summers, according to a report issued last March, has negatively affected moose. Along with a drop of nearly 2,000 moose since 1995, temperatures are rising, leaving moose more vulnerable to disease.LiNeBrEaKThe summer of 2007 was the driest of the last 45 years, the report said.LiNeBrEaK"I don't see the temperature change we're seeing as cyclical. The trend is definitely in one direction," Peterson said.LiNeBrEaKMoose can be moved, as a herd was transferred from Ontario to the Upper Peninsula in the mid-1980s. But the options and the chances for success, in the face of climate change, are formidable, he said.LiNeBrEaK"I'm not terribly hopeful that the trend can be reversed by something we can do," Peterson said. "There aren't too many things we can do."

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 9, 2009 Friday 	Green Scene: Happy Green Year  	ENVIRONMENT; News; Business; Lifestyle; Home and Garden  	707 words  	MY FRIEND JOHN finds all the eco-information just too much. He understands the need and the importance, he says, but it's just everywhere, every day.LiNeBrEaKDespite being a real eco-nerd, I know what John means. It can be overwhelming. Maybe you can't buy the hybrid or the solar panels or replace all flooring with renewable bamboo, but you can do hundreds of little things   it all helps and it all adds up.LiNeBrEaKAs it's a new year, maybe you can resolve to try some of these green tips. LiNeBrEaKLight brightLiNeBrEaKEvery single list I've read on eco-changes has this on it: Change your light bulbs. Switch your traditional bulbs for the swirly little fellas called compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFL).LiNeBrEaKWhile they cost more, they only use one-quarter the electricity of the oldies and last several years longer.LiNeBrEaKSome folks worry about CFLs because each bulb contains 5 mg of mercury. Simply use caution when handling them, and when they've burned out, don't toss them in with your regular garbage. Just put them in the bin with those used batteries and e-waste that need to go to a recycler.LiNeBrEaKWashoutLiNeBrEaKYour clothes spend an awful lot of time in the washer and dryer but you can save energy   and wear and tear   by washing them in warm or cold instead of hot water.LiNeBrEaKDo full loads in the most efficient machine you can. Once washed, clothesline them instead of tossing in the dryer.LiNeBrEaKPaper waitLiNeBrEaKDitching your paper trail by banking and paying bills online not only saves trees, it also helps reduce fuel consumption by the transportation that moves the checks.LiNeBrEaKIf we all viewed and paid bills online, the switch would cut solid waste by 1. 6 billion tons and curb greenhouse-gas emissions by 2. 1 million tons a year. Decrease the paper pile even more by applying for direct deposit.LiNeBrEaKEasy startupsLiNeBrEaKMost of the 25 tons of CO2 emissions each American is responsible for yearly come from the home. Try these quick hits to whittle down that number:LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKAdjust your thermostat a couple of degrees lower in the winter and a couple of degrees higher in the summer. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKCaulk and weatherstrip all windows and doors. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKInsulate walls and ceilings LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKInstall low-flow shower heads LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKTurn down the thermostat on the water heater and only run the dishwasher when full. LiNeBrEaKBe fantastic, not plasticLiNeBrEaKEvery year, more than 500 billion plastic bags are distributed and less than 3 percent are recycled. They're usually made of polyethylene and can take up to 1,000 years to biodegrade, emitting harmful greenhouse gases along the way.LiNeBrEaKIt's so easy (and potentially stylish) to switch from plastic to a cloth (or other plant-based material) bag. Next time you go shopping, BYOB.LiNeBrEaKShut it downLiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Department of Energy notes that 75 percent of all electricity used in the home is standby power used to keep televisions, DVRs, computers and the like even when they're "off."LiNeBrEaKSo, unplug that toaster and blender after breakfast, turn off the computer at day's end and shut off power strips before bed. You'll save energy and decrease CO2 emissions.LiNeBrEaKTree-mendous ideasLiNeBrEaKIn 2006, Americans only recycled 50 percent of the paper they used. Save even more trees by recycling it all, and go the extra step for a tree and buy recycled paper. It uses 60 percent less energy to produce than virgin paper.LiNeBrEaKWhile you're at it, buy tissues, toilet paper and paper towels made from recycled paper.LiNeBrEaKLive simplyLiNeBrEaKDespite my passion for all things eco, I am a recovering consumer. I love to shop, get stuff, have stuff, enjoy stuff.LiNeBrEaKYep, I'm a pretty good American. But, I rather love the Earth and desperately want to keep it lovely for my 7-year-old daughter, Sofia, so I'm finding that stuff is indeed just that   stuff.LiNeBrEaKThese days, I try to buy less, purchase smarter and get eco-friendly products. This holiday season, we dialed it back a bit and felt as happy and grateful as ever. It's all a bit corny, I'm sure, but simplifying can be simply grand.LiNeBrEaKLast but so not leastLiNeBrEaKHere's something important to note: I culled much of my information from the Time magazine/CNN online report "The Global Warming Survivor Kit."LiNeBrEaKWhile I've given you just a few eco-kick starts, their story listed 51 things to do.

Commonwealth Journal (Somerset, Kentucky)  	January 9, 2009 Friday 	Pulaski County gearing up for wintry weather  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	876 words  	Jan. 9--Please say it ain't so! Based on an independent weather forecasting website, some of the coldest weather in more than a decade is poised to move into the Lake Cumberland area early next week.LiNeBrEaKWeatherforyou.com, headquartered in Grants Pass, Oregon, is predicting bitterly cold temperatures that will push thermometers below zero on several nights during the middle of the month. Daytime highs, for the most part, will struggle from single digits through the teens to the 20s. LiNeBrEaKAn extended forecast issued by weatherforyou.com predicts a January similar to the terrible winters old-timers recall when they walked 5 miles to school in a foot of snow. We're not supposed to get that much snow, but for a two-week period, the outlook indicates temperatures will dip below zero on two or three nights and rise above freezing on only one day, Friday, January 16. Then it dives again.LiNeBrEaKFringes of the Arctic blast, according to weatherforyou.com, arrives Tuesday, January 13. The maximum reading that day will be 29 and it's downhill from there on.LiNeBrEaKThere is little likelihood of being snowbound during the cold spell. Light snow is predicted on January 15 and again on January 23.LiNeBrEaKJanuary 17 through January 19 will be dangerously cold. The high on Saturday the 17th will be a frigid 10 degrees and the low on Sunday the 18th will be 4 below. If the ground is covered by snow, it will be even colder.LiNeBrEaKThe weather is still in a bad mood. Maximum reading on Sunday, January 18 will be 9 degrees and the thermometer will drop to 3 below on the morning of the 19th.LiNeBrEaKThe high temperature on the 19th, a Monday, is forecast to be a "balmy" 16 degrees. If that's any comfort, the temperature will stay above zero at 4 degrees on the morning of the 20th.LiNeBrEaKThe slight hint of global warming on the 20th will bring some light snow and then it gets really cold again. Nightime temperatures will range into single digits and highs will be in the 20s through the forecast period, ending January 23. That's only 10 days from Groundhog Day, so the remainder of the winter is up to the furry folklore forecaster.LiNeBrEaKThis weather story had to be revised. Initially, at the onset of this article, weatherforyou.com had predicted temperatures as low as 14 below zero during the middle of the month. And, to make that believable, there was and is plenty of cold air to spare in the Far North to justify a fearful forecast. Fairbanks, Alaska, is a polar bear's dream with temperatures ranging between 45 and 55 degrees below zero.LiNeBrEaKJoe Torsitano of weatherforyou.com, in an e-mail to the Commonwealth Journal, said " ... the long range forecast (for the Lake Cumberland area) is based on computer model data issued by the National Weather Service. Currently each forecast averages information over a medium-sized area (about 1-degree of latitude and longitude) so mountainous (regions) could have discrepancies. We are continuing to narrow that ... in all areas as we build a more detailed database ...," Torsitano said.LiNeBrEaKAlso clinging to a really frigid prediction is Frymire Weather Services, issued by L.H. "Dick" Frymire of Irvington (Ky.). Frymire says January 16 will be the coldest day of the year with a reading of 12 below zero. Frymire cautions that his long-range forecast may vary a day or so either way, so he is in the ballpark.LiNeBrEaKBill Modzelewski, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Jackson, won't go that far out on the limb with a long-range weather prediction. He did say extended computer models indicate a colder trend in mid-January.LiNeBrEaKThis newspaper is of no help. The closest thing we have to a weather forecasting computer is a couple of woolly worms and a notching stick. Therefore, if this frigid outlook misses the mark, hopefully we are excused.LiNeBrEaKThat being said, it has been a while since the thermometer has dipped below zero in the Somerset area. The last time was January 27, 2003, Modzelewski noted.LiNeBrEaKA local business used to offer a prize to the person who guessed closest to day the temperature reached zero. There was always a winner in those days, but in recent years it hasn't got cold enough to win a prize and none is offered.LiNeBrEaKBelow-zero cold was a wintertime happening in Pulaski County during days gone by. Worst of the worse was January 19, 1994, when the temperature plummeted to 32 degrees below zero with about a foot of snow on the ground. Thirty-one years earlier, on January 24, 1963, it was 28 below with 6 to 8 inches of snow.LiNeBrEaKJanuary 1977 was the coldest month on record with temperatures at zero or below on 13 of the 31 days. January 1978 wasn't quite as cold, but snow piled 18 inches deep in places.LiNeBrEaKDuring both winters &acirc;[#x20ac]"&acirc;[#x20ac]" 1976-77 and 1977-78 &acirc;[#x20ac]"- ice up to a foot thick, a depth sufficiently strong to bear the weight of trucks, covered Lake Cumberland.LiNeBrEaKThat was when the lake was full of water.

The Dallas Morning News (Texas)  	January 9, 2009 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Hits and Misses  	COMMENTARY  	743 words  	Jan. 9--Speaking the right words on a bipartisan pledgeLiNeBrEaKOne promise this week by Rep. Joe Straus, the Texas House's speaker-in-waiting, will go a long way toward instilling a sense of bipartisanship to the fractious body. The San Antonio Republican, in an interview with this newspaper's Austin Bureau, said he would not campaign against any colleague of either party at election time. That sends a strong message to members who complain that outgoing Speaker Tom Craddick held grudges and worked to undermine colleagues who didn't vote his way. Texas lawmakers should be able to represent their districts' interests without fear of being punished by the speaker.LiNeBrEaKBush conservation effort at high tide LiNeBrEaKPresident George W. Bush was slow to acknowledge the dangers of climate change, earning him a deserved rap on the knuckles for lack of environmental leadership. This week, however, he deserves praise for one the boldest conservation moves by any president, designating three massive areas of the western Pacific around the Northern Mariana and Line islands as national monuments. The edict protects fish, birds, reefs and other marine life against commercial fishing, drilling and mining interests in one of the most remote and pristine parts of the globe.LiNeBrEaKTeaching on the tubeLiNeBrEaKGreat teachers often are stars of the show. Like mini-Jay Lenos, they know how to work an audience and keep them engaged, even if their audiences can be disproportionately small compared to the creativity and effort. But TeacherTube.com is changing that. A sort of YouTube for teachers, the Web site was created by Melissa ISD Superintendent Jason Smith and his brother, Adam. Now, some great teaching moments are going viral. Other teachers can use them in the classroom or just for inspiration. The site has more than 220,000 regular users, a number sure to grow as educators discover the site as a way to share and find engaging ways to reach and teach more students.LiNeBrEaKJoe knows ... journalism?LiNeBrEaKThe best part about the end of election season is that the silly story lines and the bit players who have exhausted their 15 minutes finally fade from view. Sadly, Samuel J. Wurzelbacher didn't get that memo. Joe the Plumber, who flirted with the idea of becoming Joe the Candidate, now has his heart set on being Joe the Journalist. In Israel, of all places. Never mind that Wurzelbacher once told a reporter he knows just enough about foreign policy to be dangerous. The Web site, Pajamas TV, decided that the American public had not had enough of this campaign cliche. Here's hoping that pjtv.com is proven wrong.LiNeBrEaKNeither Jones scores in predictive skillsLiNeBrEaKCutting ties with Adam "Pacman" Jones -- far less than expected as a football player but exactly as advertised as off-the-field trouble -- might seem like the most obvious move in the world. But Jerry Jones isn't the most obvious NFL general manager, and it certainly wasn't obvious to him when he (1) traded for the felon-in-waiting cornerback and (2) let him return to the active roster after an in-season suspension. Pacman, for his part, says he's quite surprised by the Dallas Cowboys announcing they would release him at their first opportunity, Feb. 9. Hard to believe, but if true, it really should close the circle on things everyone saw coming, except the two guys who should have.LiNeBrEaKNo bailout for pornLiNeBrEaKDid you see where pornographers Larry Flynt and Joe Francis are claiming that the so-called adult entertainment business is struggling in these recessionary times and deserves a government bailout? "People are too depressed to be sexually active," Hustler's Flynt said. "This is very unhealthy as a nation. Americans can do without cars and such, but they cannot do without sex." Har-har. Yes, we're sure the two dirtballs' request was tongue-in-cheek and that they merely wanted media attention (and congratulations, fellas, you got it). Still, if it's true that the $12 billion pornography industry is in trouble, we cheer for evidence that no matter how dark the economic cloud, there is a silver lining.

The Denver Post 	January 9, 2009 Friday   FINAL EDITION	DeGette gets leading role with climate, health care  	DENVER and THE WEST; Pg. B-03  	227 words  	U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette has been reappointed vice chair of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, a position that will give her significant sway over two of the biggest issues facing the next Congress - climate change policy and health care reform. LiNeBrEaKDeGette's fate as a senior member of the committee was uncertain under the new chairman, Rep. Henry Waxman. The Denver congresswoman was seen as a strong ally of outgoing chair John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat aligned with the auto industry, and she voted against Waxman in the leadership fight.LiNeBrEaKWaxman "came to me on Tuesday and asked if I would stay on as vice chair," DeGette said. "He said even though you supported Mr. Dingell in the race, I respect your ability to negotiate, and I respect your intelligence. It was a huge honor for me."LiNeBrEaK"I am delighted that she has agreed," Waxman said in a news release. "And I look forward to working with her on the important issues facing the Congress and the new administration."LiNeBrEaKThe committee will be key in President-elect Barack Obama's multibillion-dollar effort to reshape the country's health care system. But the fact that the first full hearing of the committee next week will focus on climate change signals just how aggressively Waxman plans to pursue sweeping policy changes by Congress in that area. ``We're on the fast track for that,'' DeGette said.

The Eagle (Bryan, Texas)  	January 9, 2009 Friday 	Repository catalogs history of the ocean  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	435 words  	Jan. 9--In giant refrigerated rooms on the Texas AandM University campus, 180,000 plastic containers tell the history of the ocean, the result of the school's largest research project. LiNeBrEaKSections of cylinder-shaped rock drilled from the floor of the world's oceans -- from as far away as Antarctica -- rest at the Gulf Coast Repository in stacks and rows that would total nearly 66 miles if spread out.LiNeBrEaKA U.S. National Science Foundation grant and individual countries are spending about $500 million over 10 years to fund the project. The bulk of the money goes to the AandM campus, with the rest to a research facility run by Columbia University and a nonprofit consortium of oceanographic institutes based in Washington.LiNeBrEaKA newly renovated drilling ship is expected to head for Honolulu from Singapore this month to retrieve more cores.LiNeBrEaK"Our collections are probably the largest source of our knowledge of Earth's climate over the last 150-plus million years," said curator John Firth, who runs the facility with a three-person staff. "When everybody talks about climate change today, it's all talked about in the time frame of a few decades or a century. If you really want to know what the Earth can do by itself over any time frame, this is the data."LiNeBrEaKScientists and researchers visit from around the world.LiNeBrEaKPaleontologists want to study microscopic fossils. Microbiologists examine living microbes. Igneous petrologists glean tidbits about how magma rises through the Earth's mantle.LiNeBrEaKThe repository at Research Park in College Station is one of three permanent archives that house all cores taken by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, an international marine research program.LiNeBrEaKThe other two facilities are the Bremen Core Repository in Germany and the Kochi Core Center in Japan.LiNeBrEaKThe samples are placed in plastic and shrink-wrapped to keep the water in and the oxygen out. Oxygen can cause chemical reactions, Firth said.LiNeBrEaK"We decided that food preservation techniques were the way to go," he said. "My dream is to get to a point where our preservation technology would make refrigeration unnecessary."LiNeBrEaKFirth said the best part about his 12-year career at the repository was meeting scientists from around the world.

Fort Worth Star-Telegram (Texas)  	January 9, 2009 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Trans-Texas Corridor or no, transit needs remain  	COMMENTARY  	948 words  	Jan. 9--It was nearly seven years ago that Gov. Rick Perry boldly announced what was to be the most-massive transportation project in Texas' history -- the Trans-Texas Corridor, a $184 billion behemoth, the likes of which the state had never seen.LiNeBrEaKThe plan was visionary but intimidatingly monstrous in scope, with a potential impact on everyone from would-be displaced farmers to bypassed businesses. Almost since Perry's announcement of the plan, on Jan. 28, 2002, it would be surrounded by confusion and controversy. LiNeBrEaKOn Tuesday, the Texas Department of Transportation formally declared the Trans-Texas Corridor dead, at least in name.LiNeBrEaKSo what's in a name?LiNeBrEaKThe name had become inextricably wedded with a negative imagery of 1,200-foot-wide toll roads, big foreign companies such as Spain's Cintra seeking to operate them, condemnation of private property and heavy-handed, top-down state government. Thus, the name had to be deep-sixed, state officials decided.LiNeBrEaKIt was somewhat akin to Ford Motor Co.'s desire to dissociate itself from the discredited Edsel, its late 1950s car that was a colossal commercial bust.LiNeBrEaKBut while the Edsel name evoked jokes, the mere words Trans-Texas Corridor often fostered anger, particularly in many rural communities that couldn't foresee any benefit from it.LiNeBrEaKBut Texans can still expect some of the primary concepts envisioned under the Trans-Texas Corridor to live on.LiNeBrEaKYou can, for example, expect more large toll roads to be built, and they will be needed.LiNeBrEaKBut, please, let's don't go overboard on toll roads: Many Texans have made clear that they will tolerate only so many and that they generally prefer them to be built or operated by familiar homegrown entities such as the North Texas Tollway Authority, which is constructing the new Southwest Parkway toll road in Fort Worth and Johnson County.LiNeBrEaKHigher gas taxes are neededLiNeBrEaKThe Star-Telegram Editorial Board has long supported increases in state and federal gasoline taxes, which together total 38. 4 cents per gallon. The taxes have not been raised since the early 1990s and have been eroded greatly by inflation.LiNeBrEaKHigher gas taxes wouldn't eliminate the need for more toll roads but could reduce the need somewhat. Raising fuel taxes (which might also include diesel fuel) and indexing them for inflation could provide a significant and rather stable source of transportation funding, while also offering a financial incentive for motorists to buy more fuel-efficient and less-polluting vehicles.LiNeBrEaKThat in turn would help improve air quality and could reduce emissions of greenhouse gases believed to contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKFuel tax increases could be post-dated to take effect months from now, when the current economic recession might be on the wane or perhaps ended.LiNeBrEaKFor example, any fuel tax increase that might be approved by the Legislature in its biennial session beginning Tuesday could kick in at the start of the state's next fiscal year on Sept. 1, or perhaps even later.LiNeBrEaKThinking smallerLiNeBrEaKWhen introduced, the Trans-Texas Corridor concept was revolutionary in that it was multi-modal in the extreme. Portions of it were expected to be up to 1,200 feet wide (far larger than the right of way for most highway corridors) and potentially include separate segments for passenger vehicles, freight trucks, high-speed passenger rail and water, oil and natural gas pipelines, as well as electricity and telecommunications cables.LiNeBrEaKState transportation officials are still embracing the idea of developing toll roads that could at least include vehicular traffic and rail lines. But they're now talking about limiting rights of way to a less-intrusive 600 feet.LiNeBrEaKUnder the more-restrained, post-Trans-Texas Corridor approach -- which has been given the somewhat clunky new name of Innovative Connectivity in Texas -- new roads would be built on the state's existing highway grid whenever possible.LiNeBrEaKThe Trans-Texas Corridor elicited considerable criticism because it was conceived largely from the top down, at TxDOT headquarters in Austin -- or at least that was the widely held public perception.LiNeBrEaKUnder the new approach, local decision makers would be more actively involved in initial planning in areas where projects are proposed.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, existing highway names and numbers would be retained when feasible.LiNeBrEaKThe earlier Trans-Texas Corridor plan had called for roads to be renamed -- TTC-35, for example, for the proposed new toll road that would roughly parallel the clogged Interstate 35W.LiNeBrEaKVital needs remainLiNeBrEaKIt's still critically important for the state to expand its transportation capacity dramatically to accommodate what is projected to be heavy population growth in coming decades. That's especially true in and between fast-growing major metropolitan areas.LiNeBrEaKFor example, a major expansion of Interstate 35, either by adding lanes to the existing road or creating a new road in some stretches -- will be necessary in the bustling Dallas-Fort Worth-Austin-San Antonio corridor. High-speed rail could further link major Texas cities. Diversion of freight rail and truck traffic around big cities could also prove greatly beneficial.LiNeBrEaKExorcising the Trans-Texas Corridor name in no way reduces the need to tackle the transportation problems that the corridor was conceived to solve.

The Free Press (Mankato, Minnesota)  	January 9, 2009 Friday 	Ahead of target: A voluntary but legally binding commitment  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	547 words  	Jan. 9--WINNEBAGO -- An ethanol plant at the edge of Winnebago is increasing its profits and cutting its greenhouse gas emissions through the relatively new cap and trade process. LiNeBrEaKCorn Plus joined the Chicago Climate Exchange, North America's only cap and trade system for all six greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK"I think in the United States there will be more cap and trade, and these carbon credits are going to become more valuable," said plant manager Keith Kor.LiNeBrEaKThe exchange effectively puts a price on carbon dioxide and other emissions.LiNeBrEaKUnder the program, Corn Plus pledges to meet substantial but feasible reductions in its emissions over a certain number of years. If they reduce emissions enough, they get credits they can bank or sell to other member companies that fail to meet their reduction targets.LiNeBrEaKIt started for Corn Plus when, a few years ago, they looked for a way to reduce the amount of natural gas they use. They installed a fluidized bed boiler that burns a concentrated syrup byproduct from the plant.LiNeBrEaK"We cut our natural gas use by 52 percent," Kor said.LiNeBrEaKThat reduction equals about 40,000 tons of credits, which can equal hundreds of thousands of dollars depending on the credits' value when sold.LiNeBrEaKThe plant also is saving money and reducing the burning of coal at power plants by installing two 2. 1-megawatt wind turbines in 2007. Kor said they cover 40 to 50 percent of the plant's electricity demand.LiNeBrEaKCorn Plus is ahead of its target for reducing its carbon footprint, which gains them additional credits.LiNeBrEaKCorn Plus was the first ethanol plant to join the exchange, which has a host of members including Ford, Dow chemical company and Cargill.LiNeBrEaKThe Chicago Climate Exchange was founded and is led by economist Richard L. Sandor, who was named a Hero of the Planet by Time Magazine in 2002 for founding the exchange and in 2007 as the "father of carbon trading."LiNeBrEaKReductions achieved through the exchange are the only reductions made in North America through a legally binding compliance regime, providing independent third-party verification.LiNeBrEaKMembers of the exchange make a voluntary but legally binding commitment to meet annual greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.LiNeBrEaKJim Murphy, president of the Chicago-based Carbon Green LLC, works with biofuels companies -- including Corn Plus -- to get through the extensive process of setting and verifyingcarbon reductions andjoining the exchange.LiNeBrEaKMurphy said the exchange continues to grow. " The volumes have tripled each year."LiNeBrEaKBut the values of carbon credits traded on the exchange have, like the stock market, suffered during the recession. The exchange, which had a value of $1. 5 billion, now is at $800,000.LiNeBrEaKThe price of a ton of carbon credits had been $6 but now is around $2. The value fluctuates based on supply and demand -- whether more member companies are holding credits or seeking to buy credits.

The Houston Chronicle 	January 9, 2009 Friday   3 STAR EDITION	COMICS;  Rockit creator mines material on the job;  Tim Rickard says his newspaper work translates easily to sci-fi strip	STAR; Pg. 2  	702 words  	It is hard not to be charmed by Brewster Rockit creator Tim Rickard, who is chatting by phone from North Carolina.LiNeBrEaKHe is laid-back and witty, delivering anecdotes with a warm Southern drawl. He is unassuming, never stooping to trumpet his Mensa-tested mind. And he wields the self-deprecating, occasionally dark humor of someone whose day job - as a graphic artist - depends on the health of the groaning newspaper industry.LiNeBrEaKAll this week, his sci-fi strip Brewster Rockit has played the old media's woes for satirical laughs, as Rickard mined his close-to-home take on the industry. LiNeBrEaKSo what is Rickard's own unfiltered take on old media?LiNeBrEaK"It only gets worse," says the Kentucky native, adding that his proximity to the situation is probably why he's waited to satirize it.LiNeBrEaKRickard's strip - about the lunkheaded title character and the entire crew aboard the spacecraft R.U. Sirius - has increasingly delved into topical matters since it launched in 2004, so this week's series rings as natural and none-too-forced.LiNeBrEaKQ: More than four years in, Brewster Rockit not only is very fresh but it also seems to be getting increasingly sharper, keener and still funnier. Is this how you're experiencing the strip's development as its creator, or do we overstate the case?LiNeBrEaKA: I started Brewster as just a goofy-humor-type comic strip that parodied sci-fi films.LiNeBrEaKBut after a while, I felt it was starting to get into a rut. To broaden the strip a bit, I started using current news or cultural events as material.LiNeBrEaKFrom global warming, to the economy, to illegal aliens to newspapers, etc.LiNeBrEaKNot only did this provide me with fresh material, I also felt it made the strip seem less lightweight.LiNeBrEaKQ: Your references to so many sci-fi films (including, recently, The Day the Earth Stood Still) reveals an apparent true-blue fandom of so many of these classic movies. Were you weaned on sci-fi cinema as a lad, or has your interest grown as a result of the strip?LiNeBrEaKA: I've always been a fan of sci-fi.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, that's why I chose a sci-fi theme for a comic strip despite hearing that sci-fi strips were impossible to sell to syndicates or newspapers.LiNeBrEaKI thought if I was going to fail, I might as well fail doing something I liked.LiNeBrEaKQ: Brewster is infamously as dumb as a brick, yet you yourself are a member of Mensa. Is a mental existence such as Brewster's your worst fear, or do you simply realize that we all take some secret joy in those less intelligent than ourselves? And who would win a Dumb-Off "Battle of the IQs": Brewster or Cliff Clewless?LiNeBrEaKA: One thing I've learned as a member of Mensa is that we are all stupid in some areas and geniuses in others.LiNeBrEaKBrewster taps into that "inner-idiot" we all have. We've all been in over our heads before.LiNeBrEaKPlus, we like to see underdogs prevail. Being stupid makes Brewster an automatic underdog.LiNeBrEaKAnd finally, stupid people have always made us laugh, from the Three Stooges to Homer Simpson.LiNeBrEaKAnd Cliff would win a battle of the IQs. Cliff's thing is, he's not really stupid, he's just grossly unqualified for his job as engineer.LiNeBrEaKAnd he's incredibly lazy.LiNeBrEaKQ: I think this week's series in Brewster - centering on new and old modes of delivery, as debated by iBot and Oldbot - are some type of comic "genius." Is this an area of newspapering you'd wanted to comment on for some time?LiNeBrEaKA: Besides doing Brewster, I also work full-time as a graphic artist for the News and Record newspaper in Greensboro, N.C.LiNeBrEaKWith rounds of layoffs, cutbacks and buyouts, I'm keenly aware of the plight of newspapers. I was thinking of what storyline I wanted to do next, and the current state of newspapers came to mind.LiNeBrEaKAt first, I thought there was no way of translating that theme into a sci-fi environment, but then Oldbot came to mind.LiNeBrEaKOldbot is an old-technology robot based on robots from '50s-'60s era sci-fi like the robot from the Lost in Space TV show, or Robby the robot from the 1950s movie Forbidden Planet. He was always one of my favorite characters but underused. He seemed like the perfect representative for "old media" like newspapers.LiNeBrEaKAll that was left was creating a robot to represent "new media," so I came up with Internet-bot, or "iBot," which had an iPod look about him.LiNeBrEaKAfter that, the series wrote itself.

In their fourth solo at Postmasters, they try something new: a twist on the ''life swap'' reality television genre, in which the couple's daily obligations are performed by a rotating cast of actors. LiNeBrEaK  In the mostly dull 16-minute video ''I'll Replace You,'' strangers dress the McCoys' children, have coffee with their associates and offer critiques of their students. All of this transpires without much fanfare; the children seem remarkably unfazed; the friends and colleagues don't miss a beat; and the fake McCoys gaze at each other across the dinner table with passable intimacy. LiNeBrEaK  Only in the studio-visit scenes do the actors strain and stumble. ''It's about chaos, but organized chaos; I love it,'' says one stand-in, when forced to speak about mediocre student work.LiNeBrEaK  This semantic tension animates a related project called ''Artist Talks,'' presented as a series of digital videos. Here actors give improvised slide lectures in which they claim the work of famous contemporary artists as their own. One actor describes a de Kooning ''Woman'' as a portrait of his mother; another interprets a Terry Winters abstraction as a protest against global warming.LiNeBrEaK  In ''Artist Talks'' and in parts of ''I'll Replace You,'' the McCoys hit on something: Art-speak is just ad-libbing, except when it isn't.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	January 9, 2009 Friday 	Confused governor;  View of green rules, economy is incoherent 	OPINION; Pg. B-6  	293 words  	When Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and his staff huddled in recent weeks to try to figure out how to stimulate California's reeling economy, they quickly settled on a proposal to ease environmental review rules and speed up the permit process for more than $1 billion of transportation projects. LiNeBrEaKThis makes obvious sense. Such regulations are a huge economic drag. Weakening them helps Schwarzenegger achieve what spokesman Aaron McLear called "the governor's No. 1 priority": getting people back to work.LiNeBrEaKBut try as he might, Schwarzenegger simply can't reconcile his claim to worry about jobs with his championing of two extremely costly and destructive measures adopted last month by the state Air Resources Board.LiNeBrEaKBoth edicts -- one forcing a broad switch to costlier but cleaner forms of energy; the other imposing stricter limits on diesel-fuel emissions -- will saddle the state with unique cost, sharply eroding California's ability to compete with other states and nations. Incredibly, both were adopted without a serious evaluation of their effects on the economy.LiNeBrEaKInstead, the air board's long-term economic claims for the clean-energy measure -- adopted to combat climate change -- were so addled that a Harvard expert hired to review them said they were likely to set back the fight against global warming.LiNeBrEaKIf the governor really believes this measure is his signature achievement in office, it's absurd for him to insist creating and preserving jobs are his top priority.LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger says California's example will inspire the world to finally act to stop global warming. While we wait for the rest of the world to become inspired, though, our economy will be dying -- a martyr to the governor's obsession with being seen as an environmental visionary.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 9, 2009 Friday 	Guide offers green travel tips  	TRAVEL; Features  	195 words  	Travelers who want to reduce their contribution to global warming now have a new tool to help them choose their greenest option. The Union of Concerned Scientists has released a free online consumer guide that compares the carbon footprints of a range of domestic travel options, including intercity buses, trains, planes, cars and SUVs. LiNeBrEaK"Vacation travel can generate a surprising amount of global warming pollution," said Jim Kliesch, a UCS senior engineer and primary author of the guide. He noted, for example, that a family of four flying first class from Chicago to Orlando via Houston could emit substantially more carbon dioxide than the sum of the parents' weekday commutes over an entire year.LiNeBrEaKThe guide said buses are generally the greenest travel option followed by trains, especially those that run on electricity. Big SUVs and first-class flights generally pollute the most.LiNeBrEaKThe best options for green travel can shift significantly depending on the number of people traveling and the distance traveled.LiNeBrEaKFor more information and other mode-specific tips, see the "Getting There Greener" brochure and full report, available at www.ucsusa.org/gettingtheregreener .

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 9, 2009 Friday 	Travel Insider: Travel could be cheaper in 2009  	TRAVEL  	887 words  	In view of the downturn in the world economy, it might seem strange to predict that 2009 could be a good year for travelers, especially through winter and spring. But that is exactly what Mike Fridgen, director of product management for Farecast.com, is predicting.LiNeBrEaKHe said there are three main things affecting airfare pricing in 2009: LiNeBrEaKConsumer Demand &raquo; The financial meltdown is bad for our retirement accounts but good for affordable airfare. Demand fell off significantly in late 2008 and looks to continue down through at least the first half of 2009. As we saw this year, with weak consumer demand, airlines will in turn lower their prices to fill those seats.LiNeBrEaKOil Prices &raquo; Oil prices declined in late 2008 which played a small part in the airfare discounts in November and December. If oil prices stay low (which we expect) airlines will pull back on surcharges and fares will drop. Formerly unprofitable routes will turn profitable, meaning there will be more selection for travelers. Some of those regional jets may get back in the air and bring more options and competition back to regional airports. This will also lead to some lowered airfare and screaming deals for would-be travelers.LiNeBrEaKCapacity Cuts &raquo; Capacity took a hit in the fall of 2008 and with oil prices dropping and consumer demand softening, we see capacity remaining flat in 2009. However, if demand returns in a meaningful way, look for airlines to boost capacity.LiNeBrEaKFinally, Fridgen said that "in this economy, airlines and hotels are going to have to convince people to spend money on travel, which could mean a lot of deals and sales. I think there will be a lot of tinkering with fares as airlines try to find the right mix and that will lead to a lot of price movements."LiNeBrEaKGear: A handy all-purpose packLiNeBrEaKLooking for a good all-purpose pack for a travel trek to Europe, or in just about any city in the world? The REI Grand Tour Travel Pack, available for $185 in women's and men's sizes, is a good bet.LiNeBrEaKIt features a hydration-ready removable daypack and adjustable suspension system.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 9, 2009 Friday 	More nasty gunk  	PUBLIC FORUM; Opinion  	144 words  	I was outraged to read that the new "petcoke" fuel plant that Consolidated Energy Systems wants to build in West Bountiful "fully complies with state pollution standards" ("Residents battling fuel plant," Tribune , Dec. 6). Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment contests the plant, saying that the fine particle pollutants released into the air alone would result in 20 premature deaths per year. LiNeBrEaKAir-quality standards are not absolute numbers that best protect the environment or living creatures. Think of the many years of emissions that met then-current air quality standards but were the cause of the global warming crisis and have been documented to have caused many deaths. The dreaded winter inversions, with tons of nasty gunk in the air, are apparently allowed under our current air quality emission standards.LiNeBrEaKWake up, people!LiNeBrEaKDeborah EppsteinLiNeBrEaKSalt Lake City	AIR QUALITY REGULATION (91%); EMISSIONS (90%); AIR QUALITY (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); STANDARDS and MEASUREMENTS (90%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (88%); PARTICULATE MATTER (88%); DEATHS and DEATH RATES (86%); GLOBAL WARMING (68%)  		SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA (79%) UTAH, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 10, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved  	Public Forum Letter  																					
Seattle Times (Washington)  	January 9, 2009 Friday 	Global warming will be a killer for agriculture, UW scientists say  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	883 words  	Jan. 9--When searing heat waves blasted Western Europe in 2003, more than 50,000 people perished and harvests of corn, wheat and fruit fell by up to a third.LiNeBrEaKImagine those temperatures being the norm over much of the world, and you'll have an idea of what the future is likely to hold for agriculture -- and humanity, says a new report from scientists at the University of Washington and Stanford University.LiNeBrEaK"I'm not worried about Greenland sliding into the sea. I'm not worried about sea levels going up," said UW atmospheric-sciences professor David Battisti. Those changes will take several hundred years to unfold, he said, but the effects on agriculture will begin showing up within the next several decades. LiNeBrEaK"This is probably the most compelling reason why we need to deal with global warming."LiNeBrEaKIf the buildup of greenhouse-gas emissions isn't halted or slowed, the odds are higher than 90 percent that average growing-season temperatures will be higher than in recorded history across a big swath of the planet by the end of the century, says the analysis published today in the journal Science. The hardest-hit areas will be the tropics and subtropics, which encompass about half the world's population and include Africa, the southern United States, and much of India, China and South America.LiNeBrEaK"We are headed for a completely out-of-bounds situation for growing food crops in the future," said report co-author Rosamond Naylor, director of Stanford's Program on Food Security and the Environment.LiNeBrEaKThere is time to adapt to the rising temperatures through development of heat-resistant crops, the scientists say.LiNeBrEaKHigh temperatures cause plants like rice, corn and wheat to grow faster but reduce plant fertility and grain production. With average growing-season temperatures expected to rise more than 6 degrees F in many places, crop yields will fall 20 to 40 percent, the report estimates. The effects will be aggravated by increased evaporation and loss of soil moisture.LiNeBrEaKEven in the United States, where warming caused by greenhouse-gas emissions is projected to increase some crop yields through the middle of this century, harvests will most likely fall by 2100 as the heat intensifies.LiNeBrEaKBut worldwide, the impacts will be felt most keenly by subsistence farmers and the poor, Battisti pointed out.LiNeBrEaK"You're talking about hundreds of millions of additional people looking for food because they won't be able to find it where they find it now."LiNeBrEaKFrance and Italy were able to turn to other nations to fill their food gaps in 2003, but a 1972 drought in the former Soviet Union showed how easily worldwide grain supplies can be disrupted, the report says. After the Soviets secretly began buying vast amounts of wheat, global prices more than tripled.LiNeBrEaKIn a warmer future, there will be fewer places to turn for help when the cupboards are bare, Battisti said. "In a sense, there will be no place to hide from this."LiNeBrEaKThe scientists reached their conclusions by combining climate data with projections from 23 global climate models used by the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change, winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.LiNeBrEaKMichael Glantz, a political scientist who studies the social impacts of climate and climate change, said the study raises some good points, but that the developing world faces so many immediate problems it's difficult to worry about what will happen in five decades or more.LiNeBrEaK"When I think about 2100 and climate-change impact on food security, I just glaze over," said Glantz, who directs the Consortium for Capacity Building at the University of Colorado, Boulder.LiNeBrEaKBut Cary Fowler, director of the Rome-based Global Crop Diversity Trust, says the report is a wake-up call for the need to develop new heat-resistant crop strains.LiNeBrEaK"This research shows we're about to enter a whole new game," said Fowler, whose group receives funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and operates the "doomsday" seed vault on the remote Norwegian island of Spitsbergen.LiNeBrEaKIt can take two decades or more to breed a new crop strain, but investments in agricultural research have been stagnant for the past several decades, Naylor pointed out.LiNeBrEaKThe Gates Foundation is helping fund an effort in Africa to develop hardier crop strains. That work hasn't focused specifically on heat tolerance, said Gary Toenniessen, of the Rockefeller Foundation, a partner in the project. But it is helping developing agricultural-research capacity where it will be needed most in the future.LiNeBrEaKSpurred partly by Battisti's work, the Global Crop Diversity Trust has launched a program to screen existing seed collections for traits like heat and drought resistance, Fowler said. It's also developing a computerized database to share the information.LiNeBrEaK"Plants can be adapted to a range of temperatures," Fowler said. "This really is a problem that we can solve."LiNeBrEaKSandi Doughton: 206-464-2491 or sdoughton@seattletimes.com	SCIENCE NEWS (91%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (91%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); RESEARCH REPORTS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); CROP PRODUCTION (89%); WHEAT FARMING (89%); WEATHER (89%); EMISSIONS (88%); POPULATION SIZE (78%); GRAIN FARMING (78%); COLLEGES and UNIVERSITIES (76%); HISTORY (74%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (71%)  		SEATTLE, WA, USA (92%) WASHINGTON, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (94%); EUROPE (92%); SOUTH AMERICA (79%); CHINA (79%); FRANCE (78%); INDIA (74%); WESTERN EUROPE (73%)  	January 9, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Seattle Times   	Sandi Doughton, Seattle Times  	UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON (57%); STANFORD UNIVERSITY (57%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	General  	20090109-SE-Global-warming-will-be-a-killer-for-agriculture-UW-scientists-say-0109  	SE  														
THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	January 09, 2009 Friday 	BLAME RECURRING FLOODS ON A TRIPLE WHAMMY\ LOGGING, CLIMATE CHANGE, DEVELOPERS  	NEWS; Pg. A1  	1078 words  	2006: Flooding throughout Western Washington shuts highways, causes power outages and forces scores of residents to flee their homes. A state of emergency blankets 18 counties.LiNeBrEaK2007: Flooding closes Interstate 5 in Lewis County and sends rescuers in rafts to evacuate Seattle apartment houses and homes.LiNeBrEaK2008-09: A massive snowstorm blankets the region, soaking the ground and feeding landslides when the snow is followed by torrential rains. Interstate 5 closes and tens of thousands of residents head for emergency shelters. LiNeBrEaKIs this becoming an annual exercise?LiNeBrEaKAnd if so, what's to blame? Development? Logging? Climate change?LiNeBrEaKThe answer is all three, to some degree, in different places around the region, and at different times.LiNeBrEaKLogging and development are prime suspects because dense forests intercept and slow down rainfall before it becomes a flood, while development plasters concrete and asphalt across marshy areas that once soaked up floodwaters. Meanwhile, climate change appears to be increasing the incidence of extraordinarily heavy rainstorms, scientists say.LiNeBrEaKA federal study adds credence to the development and logging hypotheses. In fact, the Puget Sound region so far has come out No. 1 nationally in an examination of how land cover changed - primarily from development and clearcutting - from 1973 to 2000.LiNeBrEaKThe study is nearly finished, and so far no faster rate of land conversion has been found anywhere in the nation, said Dan Sorenson, a U.S. Geological Survey geographer.LiNeBrEaKThe main reason is clearcutting, which decreased forest cover by 10 percent. The No. 2 reason is the footprint of development, which increased nearly 7 percent.LiNeBrEaKSome of that development is going into floodplains - the areas surrounding riverbanks where rivers traditionally spilled over after winter storms. Virtually all the land between West Seattle and Beacon Hill, for example, once was covered by the then-multichanneled Duwamish River and associated marshes.LiNeBrEaKNone of this week's damage should surprise anyone. In fact, one year ago this week, University of Washington geologist David Montgomery warned state legislators in testimony: "It appears to me that the flooding and landslide problems (from) this December storm stem from the combination of an unusually large storm and decades of risky behavior both in upland forestry practices and downstream floodplain development.LiNeBrEaK"The combination put people at risk and will do so again under the present system."LiNeBrEaKLate last year, the National Marine Fisheries Service said development should be halted in floodplains in Western Washington to help protect salmon under the Endangered Species Act. A Seattle lawyer who won a court case that spurred the agency's declaration said this week's flooding shows it might not be a bad idea for people, either.LiNeBrEaK"From a salmon's perspective, the science tells us that we need to stop building in floodplain habitats and allow rivers to do what they always want to do, which is periodically expand their banks and spread out," said lawyer Jan Hasselman of Earthjustice, a nonprofit law firm. "It also makes sense from the perspective of safety and emergency management to keep out of the same places."LiNeBrEaKIn Centralia, a number of residents Thursday blamed construction of a big auto dealership near I-5 for the flooding. Can't be, said Rich Horner, a UW environmental engineer who studies how civilization affects natural waterways.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think one development can account for it - but a pattern of development can," Horner said.LiNeBrEaKCentralia and nearby Chehalis have continued a decades-long pattern of floodplain development.LiNeBrEaKBut there's more to this storm, Horner said. For example, the Cedar River flooded, and virtually its entire length is protected from development. A massive amount of relatively warm rain hitting all that snow laid down in recent weeks is likely to blame, scientists say.LiNeBrEaKSo can we blame climate change? Yes and no.LiNeBrEaKA groundbreaking 2007 article in the journal Stormwater that focused on Seattle's disastrous Dec. 14, 2006, floods, which drowned a woman in a Madison Valley basement, concluded that climate change is likely changing the very measures by which engineers must prepare communities for flooding.LiNeBrEaKResearchers at the UW's Climate Impacts Group are preparing to release results of a study still undergoing final reviews. But what can be said, said Philip Mote, a researcher in the group who serves as Washington state climatologist, is that climate change will have different effects in different places.LiNeBrEaKWhile it's easy to concentrate this week on widespread predictions that climate change will increase the number of extreme storms that dump huge amounts of rain, just look over the Cascades to Eastern Washington. There, Mote said, climate change already is lessening the amount of snow, and therefore the intensity of spring snowmelt floods.LiNeBrEaK"You can't just make a blanket statement that flooding will increase," Mote said. "You see this real patchwork. In some places it clearly goes up, and in some places it clearly goes down, and in some places it doesn't change."LiNeBrEaKA 2008 study suggested that climate models used to predict effects of global warming appear to be underestimating how often climate change will produce very strong storms.LiNeBrEaKBut a co-author of the study, marine and atmospheric scientist Brian Soden at the University of Miami, said it's impossible to attribute any given storm to climate change.LiNeBrEaK"It's tempting to attribute changes like you've been having up there to global warming because it's consistent" with climate models, Soden said. "Statistically, we expect them to become more common but ... 50 years from now, you still couldn't point at any individual (weather) event and say, 'That was caused by global warming.' "LiNeBrEaKAs for logging, the 2007 flooding sparked widespread fear that clearcutting was to blame, as Lewis County residents saw big chunks of clearcut hillside become landslides.LiNeBrEaKThe state Department of Natural Resources began to investigate, and the question remains open, said Gary Graves, assistant manager of the agency's division that oversees logging.LiNeBrEaK"Are the (logging) rules protective enough?" Graves said. "That's exactly why the studies were designed, so we could go out and say are we doing the right thing or not?"LiNeBrEaKP-I reporter Casey McNerthney contributed to this report.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	January 9, 2009 Friday   THIRD EDITION	BOND revived GOP, delivered for Missouri  	NEWS; Pg. A9  	758 words  	Sen. Christopher "Kit" Bond, a feisty, folksy deal-maker, revived a moribund Republican Party when he became Missouri's youngest governor and has remained an indomitable political force through four terms in the U.S. Senate.LiNeBrEaKBond began his career as a reform-minded moderate who recaptured the governor's mansion for Republicans in 1972 after more than two decades in exile. In Washington, Bond was a relentless champion of Missouri's interests, securing millions of dollars for home-state projects and legislative favors for businesses, even as his maverick streak gave way to a harder Republican line. LiNeBrEaKBond's influence is evident today in Missouri's urban hubs, where he channeled money for public housing, lead paint abatement, university research, and Boeing's military facilities. And it's evident in rural outposts, where he snagged funds for roads, bridges, agriculture, and a bevy of other projects.LiNeBrEaKIndeed, Bond relished fights with his more fiscally conservative colleagues over spending matters, leading the charge during congressional showdowns with the Bush administration over multibillion-dollar transportation and water project bills.LiNeBrEaKIn response to his penchant for what critics called "pork" projects, Bond once said: "If they think it's pork, it's an awfully healthy diet for the people of Missouri, and I'm proud to participate in it. Just tell 'em, 'In the next batch, I'll bring my own barbecue sauce.'"LiNeBrEaKEven as he focused heavily on state matters, the fast-talking, sharp-elbowed, sometimes gruff Missourian was also a force in myriad national battles, from election reform to global warming to intelligence gathering. Although Bond lost three bids for a Senate leadership post, he wielded enormous clout as the top Republican on several key panels: a spending subcommittee, a public works panel, and the intelligence committee.LiNeBrEaKIn his years in the Senate, Bond was the chief Republican sponsor of the Family and Medical Leave Act signed by President Bill Clinton. He championed the cause of Iraq war veterans discharged from the military for personality disorders. And he secured federal funding for Parents as Teachers, a program he began as governor in Missouri.LiNeBrEaKHe worked tirelessly to protect Boeing's F-15 line in St. Louis from closing and to bolster the company's C-17 cargo planes. And he authored a five-year, multibillion-dollar federal transportation bill that steered hundreds of millions of dollars to highways and bridges in Missouri.LiNeBrEaKBond was unabashedly pro-business. He frequently locked horns with environmental groups, earning their ire for legislative riders he slipped into unrelated bills to protect businesses against what he saw as overly burdensome regulations. For example, he once tried to block California clean air standards because he said the rules would cost jobs at a Missouri lawn mower manufacturer. And he waged all-out war on behalf of the barge industry against efforts to save endangered species in the Missouri River.LiNeBrEaKOver his Senate career, Bond tilted rightward, shedding some of his moderate positions and becoming one of the Bush administration's most vocal defenders on its controversial anti-terrorism policies and other matters.LiNeBrEaKBut even as his voting record was reliably Republican, off the Senate floor Bond maintained his image as a soft-edged conservative and veteran deal-maker who was often more practical than ideological.LiNeBrEaKHe developed a strong friendship with Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, when the two lawmakers served as ranking member and chairman of the spending committee for housing, veterans affairs and the national space program, among other agencies. She once called him a "compassionate conservative" who could be "tight-fisted" on some economic issues but who was also "very concerned about people who need extra help."LiNeBrEaKIndeed, Bond's ability and willingness to get federal money for Missouri made him well-liked in St. Louis and Kansas City, where he forged strong relationships with Democratic mayors and African-American leaders.LiNeBrEaKAnd while Bond was never a big fan of the Post-Dispatch editorial page, which usually endorsed his opponents, he maintained cordial relations with reporters.LiNeBrEaKLast month, after the newspaper published a story about Missouri chestnuts, Bond sent a letter to the reporter - along with a bag of chestnuts from his farm in Mexico, Mo.LiNeBrEaK"I decided to get into the orchard business about a dozen years ago," he wrote. "While I am unlikely to make enough from the chestnuts to quit my day job, it has been a wonderful experience ...."

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	January 9, 2009 Friday   THIRD EDITION	Mike's the Right guy to talk about our automobile use  	BUSINESS; Pg. D5  	954 words  	Mike Right's face and voice are familiar to many area motorists. Journalists frequently turn to him for a quick comment on gasoline prices or driving trends. Right's 42 years with the American Association of Automobiles - with its 1. 2 million members in seven states (Missouri, Southern Illinois, southwestern Indiana, eastern Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi) - gives him a broad perspective on a variety of issues about our beloved motor vehicles. We spoke in Right's comfortable book-filled office at the AAA office at 12901 North Forty Drive.LiNeBrEaKYou've said AAA's membership is growing. That doesn't make sense, with high-priced fuel and concern over global warming. LiNeBrEaKYou've got to use the automobile. People have to go to work. They have to haul their children.LiNeBrEaKSo we're going to have the private automobile for a long time. Is that the core of your membership?LiNeBrEaKAbsolutely. I would say it's 100 percent automobile owners.LiNeBrEaKHas AAA's mission changed?LiNeBrEaKIts mission hasn't changed, but it has been modified. AAA started doing things when it was conceived, such as putting up road signs and oiling roads.LiNeBrEaKTo keep down the dust?LiNeBrEaKThat was a big deal. We started teaching youngsters how to drive. In the '50s and '60s, AAA was doing things the government now does. One reason I came to AAA 42 years ago was to do a study of Lindbergh Boulevard. It was the Outer Belt of its day. There were an awful lot of traffic crashes on Lindbergh. AAA investigated the crashes and made recommendations.LiNeBrEaKWhat's on your agenda for the Missouri Legislature?LiNeBrEaKTransportation funding. Fixing roads and bridges and not having enough money to take care of the transportation system. It could be roads; it could be mass transit. In 2007, we started to see a decrease in the funds generated by the motor fuels tax. People are driving less and buying less fuel. We're also going to see less revenue generated by motor vehicle licenses.LiNeBrEaKHow much are we talking about?LiNeBrEaKWith the gas tax, that's 5 to 6 percent. In Missouri, that could be about $20 million. That's based on 3. 7 billion gallons for the first 11 months of 2008. It's going to get worse. We've seen a phenomenon we've not seen before. Since 1983, the vehicle miles traveled over the United States grew steadily. In 2007, it was 3 trillion miles. Now it's 2. 995 trillion miles.LiNeBrEaKSome people would say that's not a bad thing.We're probably not going to see a return to the steady growth of gasoline consumption and vehicle miles. Those days are gone. The real question is how much of an impact this will have on the economy, or how much the economy is affecting this.LiNeBrEaKWhat else do you want to see the Legislature do?LiNeBrEaKWe've got to look at alternatives to the funding mechanism for transportation.LiNeBrEaKDon't we have a user tax now?LiNeBrEaKSurveys suggest people are more open to taking the smallest possible bite out of their wallet. They don't want to get a bill for $300 at the end of each year in the form of an increase in the registration fee. They don't want anyone to put a 15-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline. The tax that people found least objectionable was a general sales tax, maybe one-half or a whole percent.LiNeBrEaKDoes AAA support rebuilding the highway infrastructure - highways and bridges - to help rebuild the economy?LiNeBrEaKThere's a direct relationship between spending on infrastructure and creating jobs. We support that. What we may not support are the specifics on where they spend the money and where they will get the money.LiNeBrEaKIt will take a federal fuel tax increase of 12 to 15 cents to sustain the current system.LiNeBrEaKIt's amazing how much of our economy is built around the internal combustion engine.LiNeBrEaKSomething like one out of eight or one out of 10 workers.LiNeBrEaKIs a so-called green economy the future for motorists?LiNeBrEaKIt's coming. Not soon enough. Solar cars will not do it. The concept is valid, but they've got a lot of refining to do. There's hydrogen. You can propel a vehicle with just about anything - coal, steam, electricity, propane, animal fat, vegetable fat.LiNeBrEaKWill we still see private vehicles in the future?LiNeBrEaKAbsolutely. I don't think you'll ever see individual mobility go away.LiNeBrEaKOne of the things that's been mentioned is a vehicle-mile tax. That would require a little black box in everybody's vehicle. That's probably the fairest way to do it. You would pay based on your use.LiNeBrEaKWhat do you think of the Highway 40 improvement?LiNeBrEaKWhat I've seen of it so far, I like. It's not visually exciting, (but) it's eminently safer.LiNeBrEaKWhat's safer about it?LiNeBrEaKYou have a median barrier of consequence. You have a much fuller inside shoulder you can actually drive on if you have to. Intersection configurations are much improved.LiNeBrEaKIs MoDOT director Pete Rahn doing a good job?LiNeBrEaKMost people were absolutely shocked at the lack of impact (on the closing of Highway 40). There were an awful lot of people who thought the world was going to end when they shut 40. People adjusted amazingly well.LiNeBrEaKWhat about the second phase, which just started?LiNeBrEaKThat will have more problems. But I think it will be done ahead of time.LiNeBrEaKWhat will cars look like in 20 years?LiNeBrEaKLike they do now. You will see a lot of vehicles operated by different power plants or on different fuels.LiNeBrEaKCan this country survive without the Big Three automakers?LiNeBrEaKWe are losing our industrial base. There are an awful lot of improvements in the automobile that got there as a result of the enthusiasm of individuals who loved cars.LiNeBrEaKMike Right Position: Vice president of communications, AAA of Missouri Age: 65 Career: Traffic analyst, city of St. Louis, 1962-1966; traffic analyst, safety analyst, magazine editor and spokesman for AAA of Missouri, 1966-present Education: Attended Washington University Personal: Lives in south St. Louis County with his wife, Mary; two adult sons 	OIL and GAS PRICES (90%); GASOLINE PRICES (89%); GASOLINE (78%); FUEL TAX (78%); LEGISLATORS (77%); GASOLINE MARKETS (73%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (72%); CONSUMPTION (67%); ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS (64%); TAXES and TAXATION (64%); GLOBAL WARMING (54%) {DOC SEPARATOR}  		MISSOURI, USA (95%); INDIANA, USA (92%); LOUISIANA, USA (92%); ARKANSAS, USA (92%); MISSISSIPPI, USA (92%); ILLINOIS, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	January 11, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Inc.

The State (Columbia, South Carolina)  	January 9, 2009 Friday 	DHEC board to hear appeal on coal plant: Board to consider opponents' concerns  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	635 words  	Jan. 9--The state's environmental protection board agreed Thursday to hear arguments against a coal-fired power plant that would discharge mercury, carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the air along the Great Pee Dee River.LiNeBrEaKDepartment of Health and Environmental Control board members said they can't ignore the controversy over the power plant proposed for Florence County. The board will hold an appeal hearing next month for an air emissions permit. LiNeBrEaK"This is a matter of concern to the citizens of this state," DHEC board member Edwin Cooper said. "It would be impossible for us not to consider."LiNeBrEaKIn December, conservation groups challenged the air permit DHEC staff members issued for the $2. 2 billion project. They said the staff illegally awarded the permit to the state-owned Santee Cooper utility and asked DHEC's board to hear them out.LiNeBrEaKSantee Cooper and some of the state's most influential business groups say the coal plant must be built to maintain adequate power and attract more industry to the job-starved Pee Dee region of eastern South Carolina. The plant itself will produce about 100 permanent jobs as well as about 1,400 positions during construction.LiNeBrEaKBut opponents note that coal-fired power plants are among the main sources of the carbon dioxide pollution that contributes to global warming and increasingly are out of favor as a power source. The Pee Dee plant would release an estimated 10 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.LiNeBrEaKMercury from coal plants also rains back to earth, settles in rivers and builds up in fish, making many of them too toxic to eat. The Florence County coal facility would release 93 pounds of mercury each year along a river that already has warnings against eating mercury poisoned fish.LiNeBrEaKLaura Varn, a spokeswoman for Santee Cooper, said the plant is being designed to prevent major impacts on the environment. But she said her company welcomes the February appeals hearing.LiNeBrEaK"We'll work with whatever decisions the DHEC board makes," said Varn, whose agency hopes to have the plant operating by as soon as 2013.LiNeBrEaKThursday's action by the DHEC board is atypical. The board usually chooses not to hold appeal hearings on staff permit decisions but will do so if a case is of statewide interest, will clarify the law or will help the agency shape policy.LiNeBrEaKBoard member Glenn McCall said the Santee Cooper power plant fits that description. He has received a number of e-mails about the power plant that show how important the case is for DHEC to consider, McCall said.LiNeBrEaKRegardless of who wins before the DHEC board, the case likely will be appealed to the state Administrative Law Court and possibly the S.C. Court of Appeals. The plant also needs other permits, such as approval to work in wetlands and to build coal ash disposal sites.LiNeBrEaKEven so, plant opponents who attended Thursday's meeting said the agency's board made the right decision to hear the case because of its potential impact on people's health and the environment. Among them were Myrtle Beach resident Cynthia Powell and Santee River Keeper Mark Bruce. The Santee River runs from just south of Columbia, through lakes Marion and Moultrie, to the coast. Parts of the river system have coal plants nearby and mercury warnings on fish.LiNeBrEaK"The citizens that live in the area of the coal-fired plant are really concerned about what is going to be their future," Bruce said.LiNeBrEaKReach Fretwell at (803) 771-8537.

Tampa Tribune (Florida)  	January 9, 2009 Friday 	America receives a leading man for the dramas ahead  	COMMENTARY  	760 words  	When President Obama takes his hand off the Bible and walks to the Capitol lectern, he carries real power in his pocket, maybe more than any president since FDR, and some of it he has earned and some is a gift.LiNeBrEaKSome is due to that phenomenal marathon run of his and the show of discipline and steady good humor and serious resolve, which won him support beyond the usual precincts, and then too there is his graceful command of American language that we dream of in a president. And the country's great weariness of his predecessor creates a big wave for the new man to ride in on, and the financial crash gives him a drama to grapple with and show his mettle. The world is watching. The country is prepared for leadership. Good things are expected. LiNeBrEaKWhat is so refreshing today is how America has come up with a hero at a time when we very much wanted one. For some of us, it's been a long time since we had a hero and we're a little dumbfounded by how much we like this one. A genuine hero who rose on the strength of his own gifts and ambition and now is poised to lead from the center and not harangue us from out in left field. There were others whom the media marked as Contenders and who raised pots of money and hired consultants and speechwriters and hairstylists, and the voters took a look and walked away. Obama is the one who looked better and better the more you heard him.LiNeBrEaKHe comes along as the great hairy-legged Internet gains dominance over the old genteel media. The old uncle anchorman (Chet, Walter, Harry, Dan) is gone forever and we become a nation of surfers and foragers of scraps of news among the driftage.LiNeBrEaKIt's as if the teacher left the room and the dopiest students are dominant. They always resented being lectured about global warming or the war in Iraq or torture, and they were thrilled when the guy with the tie disappeared, and they could goof off. Election coverage this year was notable for its irrelevance, but then it was all over, and reality appeared, in the form of vote tallies, and then came the magnificent moment that needed no comment, no voice-over analysis, when that family emerged from behind the curtain and walked down the long blue runway in Grant Park, and a wave of warm feeling came over us, and we were done with the flummery and balloon juice and the country saw its new president, a serious man for serious times, a good man who is all of a piece and all of him American.LiNeBrEaKThe country wants authenticity in its heroes. We're a nation of comedians, and we can smell hypocrisy and selling points, and we are deeply suspicious of marketing. Try to market us a hero and we will deface his picture, black out his teeth, draw stuff coming out of his nose.LiNeBrEaKThis man came through the hazing unmarked. He had given us himself in a memoir, and then in patient navigation of the electoral backwaters, and he came through it somehow enlarged, and his conduct post-election has only enlarged him further.LiNeBrEaKHe now seems to stand about 10 feet tall and is likely to grow some more in office. It is a rare moment in our history, this feeling of union and solidarity around a new leader, and we should savor the day. May the Lord heal our suspicious minds and restore us to our senses. There is work to be done and it is time to do it.LiNeBrEaKGarrison Keillor is the author of a new Lake Wobegon novel, "Liberty" (Viking), and longtime host of National Public Radio's "A Prairie Home Companion."LiNeBrEaK(c) 2009 Garrison KeillorLiNeBrEaKDistributed by Tribune Media Services, Inc.LiNeBrEaKTO PURCHASE THIS COLUMNLiNeBrEaKThe Tribune Media Services Inauguration Section stories are sold separately.

USA TODAY 	January 9, 2009 Friday   FIRST EDITION	Start-ups put farm debris to use as fuel;  Turning plant waste into cellulosic ethanol won't drive up food prices 	MONEY; Pg. 7A  	1917 words  	JENNINGS, La. -- Want to see what you'll be pumping into your car in a few years?LiNeBrEaKCome visit a scruffy patch of land here in sugar-cane country, where 15-foot-high piles of what looks like hay stretch three blocks alongside a gleaming, silver-and-yellow jumble of pipes, tanks and girders.LiNeBrEaKThe hay, actually crushed sugar-cane stalks, is feedstock for the first cellulosic ethanol demonstration plant in the USA. The biorefinery cranked up this week and, according to its backers, kicks off a new era of clean transportation fuels that won't compete with the food supply. Corn-based ethanol, by contrast, has been blamed for driving up food prices and doing little to reduce the global warming gases emitted by petroleum-fueled vehicles.LiNeBrEaKCellulosic ethanol is made from plant waste -- such as wood chips, corn cobs and stalks, wheat straw and sugar-cane bagasse (stems and leaves) -- or municipal solid waste. Simply put, the nation will soon be running its cars, at least partly, on debris. LiNeBrEaKCellulosic makers are quietly laying the foundation for a new industry even as some corn ethanol plants, facing supply shortages and low profit margins, shut down, and some oil giants put off production projects amid plummeting crude prices.LiNeBrEaKThe plunge in crude "is a short-term correction and doesn't stop our quest to develop alternative energy," says Carlos Riva, CEO of Verenium, which owns the Jennings plant. "Cellulosic ethanol is right here and ready."LiNeBrEaKThe plant will produce 1. 4 million gallons of ethanol a year, a fraction of a typical 60 million-gallon-a-year corn ethanol plant but far more than the output of the handful of tiny cellulosic pilot plants in the U.S. About a dozen cellulosic demonstration plants and six larger commercial facilities are scheduled to start up by 2012, according to the Renewable Fuels Association.LiNeBrEaKRange Fuels expects to complete the first commercial plant in Soperton, Ga., late this year. The $120 million facility will churn out 10 million gallons of ethanol a year.LiNeBrEaKRenewed interestLiNeBrEaKThat cellulosic ethanol is this close to commercial production marks a dramatic leap forward. Development in recent decades has been stymied by high costs and difficulty transferring technology that works well in the lab to mass production. Plus, every time oil prices tumbled, research funding evaporated.LiNeBrEaK"The old joke was that cellulosic ethanol was always just five years down the road," says Andy Aden, a senior chemical engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. "Now, there's steel going in the ground."LiNeBrEaKDriving the renewed interest is growing concern about global warming and a belief that Congress eventually will limit carbon dioxide emissions from petroleum-fueled vehicles. It didn't hurt that, in 2005, crude prices shot up to $60 a barrel and hit a high of $147 in 2008 before falling below $50 in recent months.LiNeBrEaKVenture-capital firms have poured $682 million into cellulosic start-ups since 2006, up from $20 million the previous two years, according to research firm New Energy Finance. And the Department of Energy has provided nearly $850 million for research and development.LiNeBrEaK"All of a sudden, this went from dog to darling," says Lee Lynd, a pioneer in cellulosic research who co-founded Mascoma, a cellulosic start-up that's still developing its technology.LiNeBrEaKProducers still face hurdles, including a credit crisis that's delaying several commercial plants. But in 2007, President Bush signed a bill mandating that biofuels make up 36 billion gallons, or 16%, of motor fuel by 2022, with 16 billion gallons coming from cellulosic ethanol. Corn ethanol consumption, which totaled 9 billion gallons, or 7% of the gasoline market, last year, is capped at 15 billion gallons.LiNeBrEaKA big advantage for cellulosic fuel is that refineries can be tailored to a region's leading crop, reducing delivery costs: wheat straw and corn residue in the Midwest; sugar cane in the South; and wood in the Pacific Northwest and Southeast. Corn ethanol refineries are largely confined to the Midwest.LiNeBrEaKAnother selling point is that cellulosic ethanol can cut greenhouse gas emissions by 86% compared with gasoline, while grain ethanol trims emissions just 20%, DOE says. That's because diverting corn to fuel means razing forests or plowing grasslands to plant substitute corn crops, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. That releases CO{-2} into the air.LiNeBrEaKSpecial enzymesLiNeBrEaKBut it's a lot harder to make ethanol from farm waste than corn. Corn has starches that enzymes can easily break down into sugars; yeast ferments the sugars to produce ethanol. By contrast, stalks and leaves contain carbohydrates that are tougher to unravel because they're tightly bound with other compounds that make plants firm so they can stand and resist wind.LiNeBrEaKManufacturers must create special enzymes to unlock the carbohydrates. At about 10 cents a gallon of ethanol, they're twice as costly as those used for corn ethanol. They also must genetically engineer bacteria to ferment the sugars into ethanol.LiNeBrEaKRecent advances have resulted in more efficient enzymes that substantially cut costs, Aden says. Still, he says, cellulosic wholesale costs are $2 to $3 a gallon, vs. $1. 56 for corn ethanol. But since feedstock costs about half as much, Aden says prices should drop to $1. 33 by 2012.LiNeBrEaKThere are other challenges. Producers must scavenge enough agricultural residue to supply a factory that will churn out as much as 100 million gallons of ethanol a year. They typically must round up the scraps within a 75-mile radius to avoid high transportation costs that can erase profits.LiNeBrEaKAt its Jennings plant, Verenium gets its bagasse from a sugar mill that's supplied by area sugar-cane farms. To ensure a steady supply, it's also growing "energy cane," a crop that has too little sugar for mills but much thicker stalks.LiNeBrEaKOther companies plan to raise similar energy crops, such as switch grass, that theoretically can be grown on land degraded by farming. But environmental groups such as NRDC worry that if the crops are grown on regular soil, they'll pose the same food supply and CO{-2} concerns as corn.LiNeBrEaKVerenium is also experiencing some growing pains as it shifts a chemical process involving delicate microbes from a pristine lab to a bustling, three-story factory. In tests several months ago, a strainer did not remove all the rocks and clay from the sugar bagasse, jamming machines. Manager Mark Eichenseer purchased a $90,000 grinder to more finely chop the bagasse before feeding it to the conveyor.LiNeBrEaKAnother machine that uses heat, pressure and acid to separate glucose and non-glucose sugars was not finishing the job. Eichenseer raised the temperature and acid dosage. Eichenseer is hiring a pump expert to improve the flow of the cellulose, which becomes a sticky mush and sometimes clogs equipment. He's also careful to keep tanks and pumps from getting infected with foreign bacteria, which can reduce ethanol yields. "That's the most difficult challenge," he says.LiNeBrEaKFungi that produce enzymes are grown in three stages over eight days. Fermentation takes an additional two to three days. Ensuring continuous output can be tricky. In tests last month, most of the plant was abruptly shut down to prevent backups on the conveyor. Corn ethanol is processed in two to four days.LiNeBrEaKTo make cellulose cost-competitive with corn, Eichenseer is working to scale back the nutrients he feeds the bacteria and the energy to run the refinery without sacrificing ethanol yields. The company also may chop and store energy cane at the farm to trim handling costs.LiNeBrEaKDifferent approachesLiNeBrEaKSome competitors are working on technology they say could slash costs further. Mascoma is developing a bug that does double-duty: It makes enzymes to produce sugars and ferments the sugars into ethanol. Costs should be under $1 a gallon, Lynd says.LiNeBrEaKOthers are taking different approaches by tapping:LiNeBrEaK*Corn cobs. Poet, the world's largest ethanol producer, has tested two types of combines that allow both corn and cobs to be gathered at the same time to slash labor expenses. The company expects to produce 27% more ethanol per acre of corn.LiNeBrEaKPoet plans to expand a 50 million-gallon-a-year corn ethanol plant in Emmetsburg, Iowa, to produce 100 million gallons of corn ethanol and 25 million gallons of cellulosic fuel by 2011. "It's going to take both (grain and cellulosic ethanol) to replace oil from dangerous parts of the world," Poet CEO Jeff Broin said.LiNeBrEaK*Wood chips. Range Fuels plans to buy wood waste from paper mills and loggers for the plant it's building in Soperton, a heavily forested area. Instead of using enzymes, Range says it has a less-expensive process that employs heat and pressure to convert wood into a synthetic gas. It then runs the gas over a catalyst to make ethanol.LiNeBrEaKRange CEO David Aldous says the plant eventually will make 100 million gallons of ethanol a year, requiring a delivery of 12. 5 dry tons of wood scraps every seven minutes. But a second phase of the facility that was to be done by early 2012 is delayed six months because financing isn't available.LiNeBrEaK*Municipal solid waste. BlueFire Ethanol will use trash to feed a 3 million-gallon-a-year demonstration plant it's planning in Lancaster, Calif. Its secret sauce: a low-cost acid that breaks a variety of materials into sugars, rather than an enzyme that's optimized for a certain type of plant. By taking tree remains, lawn clippings and construction debris from the city, BlueFire will gets its feedstock for free while Lancaster avoids paying landfill fees, says company Chief Financial Officer Christopher Scott. Because it doesn't have to use farm residue, BlueFire can build plants near big cities on the East or West coasts, avoiding high costs to truck ethanol long distances.LiNeBrEaKBut construction of the $30 million Lancaster plant, scheduled to start last month, has been pushed back because the credit crisis has dried up funding.LiNeBrEaKThe delays have raised uncertainty over whether the industry will meet the production mandates. The Bush administration is providing tax incentives of $1. 01 a gallon for cellulosic ethanol as well as loan guarantees. Analyst Laurence Alexander of Jefferies  and Co. says much more federal aid is required. At least some additional funding is likely, he says, citing President-elect Barack Obama's support for biofuels. And start-up Coskata raised $40 million in private equity in October despite the brutal climate.LiNeBrEaKYet how much cellulosic ethanol will motorists actually use?LiNeBrEaKMost U.S. gas pumps now contain 10% ethanol blends, and the government is testing blends up to 20%. In two decades, more flex-fuel cars that can accept blends of up to 85% ethanol are expected to be on the road.LiNeBrEaKBy then, cellulosic ethanol realistically could replace a quarter of the nation's gasoline -- which would dramatically reduce both oil prices and global warming emissions, says David Friedman of the Union of Concerned Scientists. DOE says there's enough feedstock to supplant 30% of gasoline consumption. Of course, electric cars and hybrids are also expected to play a big role.LiNeBrEaKThere are skeptics. David Pimentel, an agricultural science professor at Cornell University, calls the DOE estimate "imaginary." Removing too much plant waste from fields will erode soil, he says, while growing energy crops will jeopardize the food supply.LiNeBrEaKVinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures, the top backer of cellulosic start-ups, remains upbeat. By 2050, he says, "You should be able to replace most (gasoline)" with cellulosic ethanol.

USA TODAY 	January 9, 2009 Friday   FINAL EDITION	Study warns of dire overheating of crops;  By year 2100, record temps could hit U.S. 	NEWS; Pg. 6A  	398 words  	Hotter summers from global warming will drastically reduce crop yields and lead to a disastrous food shortage for billions of people by the end of this century, predicts a study released Thursday in the journal Science. LiNeBrEaK"The hottest seasons on record will represent the future norm in many locations," says the study by David Battisti, a University of Washington atmospheric scientist, and Rosamond Naylor, director of Stanford University's program on food security and the environment.LiNeBrEaKOthers aren't convinced of the danger of a food crisis.LiNeBrEaK"The paper is long on scariness and very short on facts," says Pat Michaels of the Cato Institute, who was not involved in the study.LiNeBrEaKWhile much attention has focused on the threat of increased drought because of climate change, the potential impact of increased temperatures on crops is often overlooked, the report says.LiNeBrEaKIn the tropics, higher temperatures -- as much as 9 degrees above current summer averages -- could cut crop yields by 20% to 40%, the study says.LiNeBrEaK"Because these regions are home to about half the world's population, the human consequences of global climate change could be enormous," the study says.LiNeBrEaKThe crop crisis wouldn't be limited to the tropics. Parts of the United States by 2100 could have typical summers warmer than the highest temperatures recorded from 1900 to 2006 -- along the Eastern Seaboard, the Southeast, the western Plains, the Rockies and California.LiNeBrEaKThe study points to the record heat in western Europe in the summer of 2003, which killed tens of thousands of people. Wheat yield that year in France and Italy was cut by one-third.LiNeBrEaKData were based on observations and 23 global climate models used for the milestone 2007 report of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.LiNeBrEaKMichaels says the report overlooks that the agriculture industry can adapt in a free market. The world's largest food producer -- the USA -- had a huge increase in crop yields in recent decades, as temperatures started rising, he says.LiNeBrEaK"The reality would be somewhat less grim than what they're presenting," because crops would be adapted for higher temperatures, says Linda Mearns, of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, in Boulder, Colo., who also was not involved in the report.LiNeBrEaKNaylor agrees but notes: "It will take decades to develop new food crop varieties that can better withstand a warmer climate."

USA TODAY 	January 9, 2009 Friday   FINAL EDITION	Start-ups put farm debris to use as fuel;  Turning plant waste into cellulosic ethanol won't drive up food prices 	MONEY; Pg. 1B  	1917 words  	JENNINGS, La. -- Want to see what you'll be pumping into your car in a few years?LiNeBrEaKCome visit a scruffy patch of land here in sugar-cane country, where 15-foot-high piles of what looks like hay stretch three blocks alongside a gleaming, silver-and-yellow jumble of pipes, tanks and girders.LiNeBrEaKThe hay, actually crushed sugar-cane stalks, is feedstock for the first cellulosic ethanol demonstration plant in the USA. The biorefinery cranked up this week and, according to its backers, kicks off a new era of clean transportation fuels that won't compete with the food supply. Corn-based ethanol, by contrast, has been blamed for driving up food prices and doing little to reduce the global warming gases emitted by petroleum-fueled vehicles.LiNeBrEaKCellulosic ethanol is made from plant waste -- such as wood chips, corn cobs and stalks, wheat straw and sugar-cane bagasse (stems and leaves) -- or municipal solid waste. Simply put, the nation will soon be running its cars, at least partly, on debris. LiNeBrEaKCellulosic makers are quietly laying the foundation for a new industry even as some corn ethanol plants, facing supply shortages and low profit margins, shut down, and some oil giants put off production projects amid plummeting crude prices.LiNeBrEaKThe plunge in crude "is a short-term correction and doesn't stop our quest to develop alternative energy," says Carlos Riva, CEO of Verenium, which owns the Jennings plant. "Cellulosic ethanol is right here and ready."LiNeBrEaKThe plant will produce 1. 4 million gallons of ethanol a year, a fraction of a typical 60 million-gallon-a-year corn ethanol plant but far more than the output of the handful of tiny cellulosic pilot plants in the U.S. About a dozen cellulosic demonstration plants and six larger commercial facilities are scheduled to start up by 2012, according to the Renewable Fuels Association.LiNeBrEaKRange Fuels expects to complete the first commercial plant in Soperton, Ga., late this year. The $120 million facility will churn out 10 million gallons of ethanol a year.LiNeBrEaKRenewed interestLiNeBrEaKThat cellulosic ethanol is this close to commercial production marks a dramatic leap forward. Development in recent decades has been stymied by high costs and difficulty transferring technology that works well in the lab to mass production. Plus, every time oil prices tumbled, research funding evaporated.LiNeBrEaK"The old joke was that cellulosic ethanol was always just five years down the road," says Andy Aden, a senior chemical engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. "Now, there's steel going in the ground."LiNeBrEaKDriving the renewed interest is growing concern about global warming and a belief that Congress eventually will limit carbon dioxide emissions from petroleum-fueled vehicles. It didn't hurt that, in 2005, crude prices shot up to $60 a barrel and hit a high of $147 in 2008 before falling below $50 in recent months.LiNeBrEaKVenture-capital firms have poured $682 million into cellulosic start-ups since 2006, up from $20 million the previous two years, according to research firm New Energy Finance. And the Department of Energy has provided nearly $850 million for research and development.LiNeBrEaK"All of a sudden, this went from dog to darling," says Lee Lynd, a pioneer in cellulosic research who co-founded Mascoma, a cellulosic start-up that's still developing its technology.LiNeBrEaKProducers still face hurdles, including a credit crisis that's delaying several commercial plants. But in 2007, President Bush signed a bill mandating that biofuels make up 36 billion gallons, or 16%, of motor fuel by 2022, with 16 billion gallons coming from cellulosic ethanol. Corn ethanol consumption, which totaled 9 billion gallons, or 7% of the gasoline market, last year, is capped at 15 billion gallons.LiNeBrEaKA big advantage for cellulosic fuel is that refineries can be tailored to a region's leading crop, reducing delivery costs: wheat straw and corn residue in the Midwest; sugar cane in the South; and wood in the Pacific Northwest and Southeast. Corn ethanol refineries are largely confined to the Midwest.LiNeBrEaKAnother selling point is that cellulosic ethanol can cut greenhouse gas emissions by 86% compared with gasoline, while grain ethanol trims emissions just 20%, DOE says. That's because diverting corn to fuel means razing forests or plowing grasslands to plant substitute corn crops, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. That releases CO{-2} into the air.LiNeBrEaKSpecial enzymesLiNeBrEaKBut it's a lot harder to make ethanol from farm waste than corn. Corn has starches that enzymes can easily break down into sugars; yeast ferments the sugars to produce ethanol. By contrast, stalks and leaves contain carbohydrates that are tougher to unravel because they're tightly bound with other compounds that make plants firm so they can stand and resist wind.LiNeBrEaKManufacturers must create special enzymes to unlock the carbohydrates. At about 10 cents a gallon of ethanol, they're twice as costly as those used for corn ethanol. They also must genetically engineer bacteria to ferment the sugars into ethanol.LiNeBrEaKRecent advances have resulted in more efficient enzymes that substantially cut costs, Aden says. Still, he says, cellulosic wholesale costs are $2 to $3 a gallon, vs. $1. 56 for corn ethanol. But since feedstock costs about half as much, Aden says prices should drop to $1. 33 by 2012.LiNeBrEaKThere are other challenges.

Victoria Advocate (Texas)  	January 9, 2009 Friday 	Legislators address pollution, global warming: Bills would require better emissions regulations, greater violation penalties  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	816 words  	Jan. 9--No one wants to live in smog. Air quality and pollution affects the health of Texas residents.LiNeBrEaKState legislators may hammer out ways to keep the air clean for future generations this coming 81st Legislature. One legislator even wants Texas to lead the way in curbing carbon emissions to fight global warming.LiNeBrEaKState Sen. Glenn Hegar, whose District 18 includes the Crossroads, realizes sufficient air quality standards are not only necessary for residents' health, but for enjoying the scenic vistas and unique ecosystems in our area. Hegar already sees Houston rivaling Los Angeles as the city with the highest ozone levels in the country. LiNeBrEaK"This is not a contest we want to win and we must work to ensure that rural areas of the state continue to enjoy the excellent air quality that we have come to expect," Hegar, R-Katy, said.LiNeBrEaKThe legislature needs to promote clean air and energy by setting tougher pollution standards and creating incentives for alternatives like solar power, said Luke Metzger, director of Environment Texas in Austin. He said smog levels make it unsafe to breathe on certain days for two-thirds of the Texas population.LiNeBrEaKAll the while, oil refineries, chemical and power plants discharge unauthorized emissions without much consequence, he added.LiNeBrEaK"Texas needs to crack down on air quality violations and better monitoring and regulation of emissions is a great place to start," Metzger said.LiNeBrEaKSen. Mario Gallegos Jr., whose District 6 includes the east side of Houston, filed Senate Bill 176, which would require quicker and better reporting for emissions under the Texas Clean Air Act.LiNeBrEaKThat's in addition to Senate Bill 171 he introduced, which would take into account the cumulative effects of different air contaminants on human health. Bill 171 would establish limits and penalties and would publish an annual report that lists all violations.LiNeBrEaKBill 171 requires the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to set enforceable standards while taking into account people may be exposed to more than one contaminant at a time, which doesn't help just Houston residents, Gallegos said via e-mail.LiNeBrEaK"It will help us all breathe a little easier," he said.LiNeBrEaKGallegos also filed Senate Bill 173, which would require fence-line monitoring systems for major sources of pollution. That bill would require more monitors and at the highest concentrations of emissions, both upwind and downwind. The bill also calls for the creation of an Air Pollutant Watch List by geographic area.LiNeBrEaKArea plants don't yet know what the complex proposed legislation may mean, as the bills ask commissions to develop more precise rules.LiNeBrEaKFormosa Plastics in Point Comfort needs more time to review the legislation to better understand the implications, Jim Shephard, communications manager, said.LiNeBrEaK"These bills are dealing with very complex issues that are critical for a lot of people," he said. "Before we can make a statement on them, we would need more time to determine the effects and benefits these bills could provide."LiNeBrEaKSeadrift Coke doesn't think it will be affected short-term, but planning long-term will depend on the standards set by the commissions, John Earl, human resources manager, said. The company participates in voluntary Clean Texas efforts and already complies with federal standards, but doesn't know the benefits or burdens that may come from the legislation.LiNeBrEaK"We have a wait-and-see attitude," Earl said.LiNeBrEaKProposed legislation to curb carbon dioxide emissions may be problematic for companies as to what sources are monitored and how the state plans to come up with appropriate levels, Earl added.LiNeBrEaKEarl refers to Senate Bill 136 that was filed by Sen. Rodney Ellis, whose District 13 also includes part of Houston. That bill, also called the Texas Global Warming Solutions Act, would create a cap and trade system for the state's carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe bill calls for the state's environmental commission to quantify the carbon emissions in 1990 and create a plan to get back to that amount. Ellis thinks addressing the issue now will give it a better chance to make the state's case to the federal government.LiNeBrEaKActing now would also combat the effects of global warming, which could bring worse droughts and hurricanes, he said via news release.LiNeBrEaK"Texas can either be a leader in developing alternative energies and reap the benefits, or we will be left behind," Ellis said. "We can't pretend there is no problem."LiNeBrEaKON THE WEBLiNeBrEaKLook up the filed bills at www.legis.state.tx.us.

The Washington Times 	January 9, 2009 Friday 	Hope for hope  	LETTERS; A22  	217 words  	I'm sure I'm not the only one who, while reading Donna Brazile's "Patience required" Commentary column of Dec. 29, immediately thought of P.T. Barnum's admonition that there is a sucker born every day. I only hope her fantasy comes true. LiNeBrEaKMiss Brazile lays out four key policy areas, starting with her "nine-headed Hydra monster" of gas prices (Democrats oppose drilling our own oil), energy prices (see oil), mortgages (thanks, Rep. Barney Frank and Sen. Christopher J. Dodd), housing (see mortgages), the stock market, Wall Street, banking, insurance and credit problems (nothing a few new taxes can't heal).LiNeBrEaKNo. 2: Help Mr. Obama withdraw our troops from Iraq responsibly and safely (a policy President Bush had from the beginning that is on a timeline to be accomplished).LiNeBrEaKNo. 3: Bring about significant health care improvements. (Democrats killed any effort to reform Medicare/Medicaid, which has to be the starting point of any reform and improvement.)LiNeBrEaKFinally, No. 4: Propose energy and environmental policies that directly address our nation's dependence on foreign oil and contributions to global warming. (No drilling, no nuclear, no no no; that will work for sure.)LiNeBrEaKHer call for patience is a lot like "The check is in the mail" ; you can only hope a stamp is on the envelope.LiNeBrEaKROBERT A POGGILiNeBrEaKAlexandria	LETTERS and COMMENTS (92%); MORTGAGE BANKING and FINANCE (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (90%); OIL and GAS PRICES (76%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (75%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (66%); MEDICAID (55%); MEDICARE (52%); GLOBAL WARMING (51%) Hope-for-hope  	BARNEY FRANK (57%); CHRISTOPHER DODD (57%); BARACK OBAMA (56%); GEORGE W BUSH (56%)  	IRAQ (74%)  	January 9, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Washington Times LLC All Rights Reserved  	THE WASHINGTON TIMES  																					
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 	January 8, 2009 Thursday   Main Edition	What you eat can help the environment, too  	FOOD and DRINK; FIT TO EAT; Pg. 3K  	523 words  	Can what you eat be more important to the environment than what you drive? Kate Geagan, registered dietitian in Park City, Utah, says Americans have an "SUV eating style" that contributes to global warming more than the cars we drive. Her book, "Go Green Get Lean: Trim Your Waistline With the Ultimate Low-Carbon Footprint Diet," will be published in March (Rodale, $19. 95). I interviewed Geagan about food habits and the connection to the environment and asked her to share tips with consumers about the advantages of eating green. LiNeBrEaKQ: How can changing our diet impact the environment?LiNeBrEaKA: The average distance that your food travels to get to your table is about 1,500 miles, according to a University of Iowa study," Geagan said. "When we choose highly processed packaged foods, we contribute to global warming, so food is a new part of the dialogue about the environment. And this is something that everyone can do now and not wait for politicians to enact changes. An added bonus is that eating green saves green and what consumer doesn't want to save money on food?LiNeBrEaKQ: How is eating green different than being a vegetarian?LiNeBrEaKA: Only about 3 percent of the U.S. population identifies themselves as vegetarians, so that is not doable for most people. But what is doable is choosing local or regional foods to reduce our carbon footprint. This isn't just about eliminating meat or eating only organic foods. If your organic smoothie is shipped by air and freight halfway around the world, then it isn't healthy for the environment. Eating green strikes a balance between cost, health and the planet --- a win-win for everyone.LiNeBrEaKQ: There are several online calculators that show us how our eating affects the planet. Are these useful tools?LiNeBrEaKA: They have a wide range of accuracy, but two of the online tools that I like are the Low Carbon Calculator from Bon Appetit at www.eatlowcarbon.org and Eating Green Calculator from the Center for Science in the Public Interest at www.cspinet.org/EatingGreen/calculator.html. Both are useful tools to increase awareness about our eating habits and can show you how small changes can have a big impact over the course of a year.LiNeBrEaKQ: What are your top three tips for consumers to go green?LiNeBrEaKA: Eat more plants and cut down on beef and dairy. You don't have to give up beef or dairy, but by eating meatless one day a week you can improve the environment and do something good for your health.LiNeBrEaK* Eat less food product and eat more food. Highly processed packaged foods consume valuable resources and they are usually not very healthful.LiNeBrEaK* Rethink your drink. Bottled beverages are heavy to ship. Consider drinking tap water instead of bottled water and rethink the diet soft drinks. Did you know it takes 2,200 fossil fuel calories to produce a one-calorie diet drink?LiNeBrEaKChris Rosenbloom, Ph.D., R.D., is a professor of nutrition in the College of Health and Human Sciences at Georgia State University.

Austin American-Statesman (Texas) 	January 8, 2009 Thursday   Final Edition	Panhandle goose hunt yields chills and plenty of kills  	SPORTS; Pg. C08  	885 words  	PLAINVIEW - Even in polar bear terms, the weather was brisk.LiNeBrEaKA stiff north wind - knife-edged with just a hint of ice crystals on the blade - ran low and arrow straight, right along where we lay on the rock-hard ground. It shoved frozen fingers down our backs and set our bodies to shivering in a losing battle to cling to the little body heat trapped inside our waders.LiNeBrEaKTiny, microscopic grains of sand rode that wind, setting the insides of our eyelids to burning and penetrating the outer layers of our clothes to work their way down through the fabric until they settled like so many little silicon chiggers against the skin. LiNeBrEaKI don't know about anybody else in our group, but I was nestled against my slantboard, eyes closed to hasten my dream state, visualizing warmer weather, something north of 25 degrees , listening to the world blow past me like a plastic garbage bag on its way to the Gulf Coast. Global warming may be a worldwide problem, but it's been roped off from at least one 100-acre cornfield in the Texas Panhandle.LiNeBrEaKFrom somewhere outside my body, I heard Thomas Knight's voice: "Geese on the deck, to the right. They're coming in." I could imagine five sets of eyeballs sliding right beneath the lids, then squinting through the mesh ghillie blanket for a glimpse of the birds that soon would be floating in over the small spread of Canada goose decoys .LiNeBrEaKDistant and downwind, the sounds of the Canada geese defied physics, running counter to the wind to reach us in the spread. "Awwwp, unnnnnh, unnnh, awwwwwp, awwwp," multiplied by a hundred. Two hundred yards away, the entire flight dropped even lower than before, cupped wings creating drag for speed control and lift to keep them flying into the wind.LiNeBrEaKAt 100 yards, hands slid out of warm gloves and settled on freezing shotguns, preparing for the moment when the Canada geese would be hanging right over our heads, big as parade balloons. Knight called the shot: "Kill 'em now."LiNeBrEaKThe geese began to flare even before the guns were up, but down the line shots rang out. Ice-cold shotgun actions rattled audibly in the cold air, and geese began to fall. One, two in the spread, three out on the edge and, way out there in the corn stubble, four hit the ground in puffs of brown dust.LiNeBrEaKThe scene would be repeated multiple times over two mornings of hunting. Curtis Park and son Tyler, Ernest Cannon and son Sam and I would eventually rack up 35 geese and four sandhill cranes, not spectacular in some circles but pretty darn good for two totally clear, bluebird days in the Panhandle.LiNeBrEaKKnight, a sophomore geology major at Texas Tech University, and a couple of his buddies came to the High Plains already hooked on hunting. They decided they could keep shooting and maybe make a little extra college money by setting up a guide service for doves, ducks and geese in the fields around Lubbock. Evan Botsford and Chase Morgan joined Knight during our two days of hunting.LiNeBrEaK"We scout during the week and take hunters on the weekends," Knight said. "We try to find concentrations of birds in the afternoons and then talk to farmers about hunting on their fields."LiNeBrEaKSometimes they're told no, but most landowners would rather get rid of the birds that are decimating their crops so they welcome the young guides and their hunters.LiNeBrEaKGoose hunting, especially goose guiding, is sport for the young. Who else could go to class in the morning, jump in a dusty, decoy-loaded truck to drive a 50-mile hub around Lubbock to find birds, and then drag themselves home to study at night?LiNeBrEaKNext would be getting up at 4: 30 a.m. Saturday to load everything in the truck, pick up hunters at 5: 30 , get a breakfast taco and head out to be in the field before daylight. Then do it again Sunday morning. But it's hunting and when you're 20 years old and think a banded duck is about as pretty as a cheerleader in a skimpy uniform, you'll do what you can to keep doing it.LiNeBrEaKThe students line hunters up in the spread, using slant boards to give them slight elevation for comfortable shooting without exposing them too much to the birds' spectacular eyesight.LiNeBrEaKSlamming together a hundred goose decoy shells and jabbing graphite silhouette support rods in the dry ground in the dark is kind of a controlled chaos, but everything gets done in time for the geese to begin flying somewhere around 8 a.m.LiNeBrEaKPanhandle goose hunting is much different than coastal hunting. For one thing, Canada geese dominate the landscape. There are many fewer snows and specklebellies than on the coast.LiNeBrEaKThe main thing, though, is that it's dry land shooting most of the time. There's no wallowing around in muddy bean fields, weighed down by a soggy white parka and trying to stumble to your knees to get a lousy shot at a rapidly disappearing goose.LiNeBrEaKThe backboards allow hunters just to raise up to shoot, and the four Canadas and one specklebelly per day make a nice limit for even the most hardcore hunters out there. Cranes, an added attraction, glide over the decoys from time to time and give hunters one more target for the day.LiNeBrEaKThomas Knight guides duck and goose hunters through the end of the Panhandle waterfowl seasons. The Canada goose season runs through Jan. 25 in the Panhandle. The season for white-fronted or specklebelly geese closes Jan. 11. For information, call Knight at (214) 681-4149.

The Boston Globe 	January 8, 2009 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	Markey to lead powerful energy subcommittee Post seen as central to the Obama agenda  	NATIONAL; Pg. A2  	782 words  	WASHINGTON - Representative Edward Markey today will be awarded a key energy and environment leadership post in the House, a move that will make the Malden Democrat one of the most powerful players on Capitol Hill on an issue central to President-elect Obama's first-term agenda.LiNeBrEaKMarkey, a 17-term congressman with a strong record against nuclear power and for more fuel-efficient cars, will be named chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment, lawmakers and Democratic leadership staff confirmed to the Globe. Markey already chairs the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, a new panel that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created in early 2007. LiNeBrEaK"It's time to create the clean-energy age," Markey said in an interview. "My goal is now to create an energy policy that creates millions of new jobs in the United States," many of them in New England, where high-tech firms can benefit from Obama's proposed Green Jobs initiative, Markey said.LiNeBrEaKThe appointment is a boost for Massachusetts, which will have an influential advocate in Washington on a range of issues affecting New England, including hazardous waste disposal, nuclear power, clean air, and home heating assistance.LiNeBrEaKIn a telephone interview, Pelosi lauded Markey for his "knowledge, experience, judgment, and ability to communicate on this subject so effectively." Combined with his chairmanship of the select committee on global warming, "this makes him really a powerhouse on the issue of global warming and energy independence," she said.LiNeBrEaKThe assignment also signals a shift under Pelosi toward a more environmentalist perspective on energy policy. After the 2008 elections, veteran Representative John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat supportive of his state's automobile industry, was replaced as the longtime chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee with Representative Henry Waxman, a California Democrat favored by environmentalists.LiNeBrEaKMarkey, the House's most vocal advocate for tighter automobile emission limits, will replace Democratic Representative Rick Boucher, who represents a coal-country district in Virginia. Boucher will take Markey's current position as chairman of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet.LiNeBrEaKFurther, Markey's new subcommittee will have expanded jurisdiction, adding a wide range of environmental matters to its portfolio. Previously, the panel had control over energy and air-quality matters. The leadership changes are expected to be ratified at a House Democratic caucus meeting today.LiNeBrEaK"In the last Congress, the two people who were in charge of writing global warming legislation in the House of Representatives ... were big auto and big coal," said Kevin Knobloch, president of the Cambridge-based Union of Concerned Scientists, referring to Dingell's and Boucher's support for their local auto and coal industries. Markey's ascension "is part of an exciting, game-changing leadership in the Congress on climate and energy," Knobloch said.LiNeBrEaKMarkey has long been a target of many in the energy industry, who oppose his repeated proposals to impose tighter, more expensive standards on the auto and energy industries. But environmentalists and supporters of newer technologies hailed the congressman's work.LiNeBrEaKMarkey has been "a huge promoter of alternative energy and new technology," said Dave Vieau, president of the Watertown-based A123 Systems, which supplies batteries for hybrid cars. "It's fantastic for Massachusetts, but really great for the country."LiNeBrEaKMarkey said he has an ambitious agenda that includes addressing global warming and developing a new energy policy aimed at renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, and biomass sources of power. Markey is also determined to pass a "cap and trade" package, which would limit ozone-depleting pollution emissions and require industries to purchase licenses through a government auction to cover the amount of ozone-damaging pollution they produce.LiNeBrEaKWhile the incoming Obama administration is not involved in the internal politics of selecting committee and subcommittee chairmen on the Hill, Markey is likely to face a friendly White House team on energy and environmental issues.LiNeBrEaKHe is close with Carol Browner, the former Environmental Protection Agency administrator who has been tapped to be Obama's new coordinator of energy and climate policy. Markey and Obama also have very similar visions on how to reduce the American reliance on foreign oil and clean the air, such as creating millions of "green jobs" by investing in new energy technologies.LiNeBrEaK"This is the next technological revolution in America," Markey said. "The stars are aligned for great change."

The Boston Globe 	January 8, 2009 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	A pledge to live greener Residents get help calculating savings  	WEST; Pg. Reg1  	893 words  	GLOBE WEST 1 / NEEDHAMLiNeBrEaKSlow down. Unplug. And eat your vegetables.LiNeBrEaKIt sounds like a self-improvement plan for the new year, but it is actually a Needham environmental group's version of a health-improvement plan for the planet.LiNeBrEaKWhether residents are interested in going green or just saving some green, the Green Needham Collaborative is betting that what they really need are some specifics. LiNeBrEaKSo the group worked with an Olin College of Engineering student to develop an online form to help residents figure out how to cut their carbon footprint by at least 10 percent. The 10 Percent Energy Challenge officially kicks off this month.LiNeBrEaK"There's almost too much information around and it's very difficult for people to make sense of it," said Eleanor Rosellini, a member of Green Needham's steering committee. "Our goal was to make it as easy as possible for people to make a plan to save energy."LiNeBrEaKThe collaborative is asking residents to fill out the 10 Percent Energy Challenge form at www.challenge.greenneedham.org, which provides step-by-step directions on how they can reduce household energy consumption, and a progress report on reaching the target for each step they pledge to take.LiNeBrEaKThe "My Plan" form starts participants at the average American household's annual output of 54,000 pounds of carbon dioxide (the most common greenhouse gas linked to global warming, the site notes). There is also a link to allow users to figure out their household's specific carbon output from the burning of fossil fuels, if they don't want to use the average figure.LiNeBrEaKThe form then takes users through simple questions so that they can figure out how to cut that annual figure by at least 10 percent; for the average starting point, that's 5,400 pounds of carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKDon't mind giving up a few burgers or steaks? Adding one vegetarian meal per week reduces your annual footprint by 700 pounds.LiNeBrEaKBeen meaning to switch from incandescent to compact fluorescent bulbs? You get a credit of 150 pounds per year for each light bulb switched.LiNeBrEaKResidents enter where they pledge to make cuts, and the website does the math. And if you want to know why and how the changed behavior reduces your footprint, there are links for additional explanations.LiNeBrEaK"Anybody can go through in about 10 or 15 minutes, and what we hope is everybody can come up with something," said Michael Greis, cofounder and cochairman of the Green Needham Collaborative, and chairman of the town's School Committee.LiNeBrEaKGreen Needham includes both quick fixes and more complex changes to reduce a household's energy consumption.LiNeBrEaK"Just something like turning off your computer," said Rosellini. "There's a myth around for years and years that it's bad to turn off your computer. We wanted more of a link there that actually has some government sources and some good solid sources about why it's OK to do that."LiNeBrEaKGreen Needham recommends having a computer switch to standby if it won't be in use for 20 minutes, and turning off any computer that won't be used in at least two hours, providing an annual carbon savings of 500 pounds per computer.LiNeBrEaKAnother favorite quick fix from Green Needham has to do with fighting "vampire power," the electricity sucked up by appliances that are turned off but still plugged into an outlet.LiNeBrEaKNeedham resident Tom Gehman is taking the 10 Percent Energy Challenge. He said he actually got to 13. 4 percent largely by plugging groups of electronic devices or appliances into power strips, which make it easy to disconnect the equipment from the grid when not in use.LiNeBrEaK"If you touch it and it's warm, it's using power whether it's turned on or not," said Gehman.LiNeBrEaKAs an electrical engineer, Gehman got a little more involved in the challenge than the average resident. He bought a low-power watt meter so he could measure exactly how much power an appliance was using while off. And he also calculated his dollar savings just for fun.LiNeBrEaKGehman discovered that his new high-definition television draws 18 watts when it's turned off but still plugged in. Just by shutting off the TV's power strip when it's not in use, he said, he saves almost $3 on his monthly electricity bill. When he was done with all the household math, Gehman found he would save $444 annually just with his new power strip vigilance.LiNeBrEaKHe also unplugged an unused refrigerator and reprogrammed his thermostat to save more energy, he said.LiNeBrEaKGehman said he appreciates getting the specific information.LiNeBrEaK"Having a number in your mind is better than a vague idea of `Oh, it's consuming something,"' he said. "If you have an actual number, then you know what it's worth to go down to Staples and get a power strip."LiNeBrEaKSome of the more challenging fixes suggested by Green Needham include buying a car with better gas mileage, and replacing older refrigerators and furnaces with more efficient models.LiNeBrEaKGreen Needham organizers say their site makes it easier to conserve energy, reducing contributions to global warming, but the group's next challenge is getting residents to act.LiNeBrEaK"We feel that we've done a lot of consciousness raising, we've done teaching," said Rosellini. "We want people to not just learn but do something about what they've learned."LiNeBrEaKThe collaborative is holding a drawing for residents who take the challenge by April 30, with the prizes including energy-saving products and services.

Dick Durbin pushes to get $1. 87 billion project back on track  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	582 words  	Jan. 8--WASHINGTON -- The massive economic stimulus bill taking shape in Congress could include a controversial billion-dollar boost for Illinois: the resurrection of an experimental coal power plant in Mattoon.LiNeBrEaKMembers of the Illinois delegation are pushing President-elect Barack Obama to include the $1. 87 billion FutureGen project, which Mattoon appeared to secure before the Bush administration abruptly pulled the plug last year, in the package of tax cuts and government spending that Obama hopes to sign shortly after Inauguration Day.LiNeBrEaKSteven Chu, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist and energy secretary nominee, met with delegation members Wednesday to discuss the plan. In a conference call with reporters, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said Chu had a "positive response" and that "we have an opportunity here to put [FutureGen] back on track." LiNeBrEaKAsked if he believed Obama would include the project in the stimulus, Durbin sounded confident but cautioned, "I won't say that it's a sure thing at all. ... No commitment has been made yet."LiNeBrEaKRestarting FutureGen could upset environmental groups, who call coal-fired power plants the biggest contributor to global warming because of their high carbon dioxide emissions. A coalition of environmental groups recently launched an ad campaign that compares "clean coal" to mermaids, space aliens and Bigfoot.LiNeBrEaKObama championed FutureGen and similar coal projects in the Senate and on the campaign trail. But Chu, before his nomination, famously called coal his "worst nightmare" for alternative energy.LiNeBrEaKTo get FutureGen back on track, the Energy Department must approve a previously submitted environmental impact statement and funding would need to be restored, said FutureGen Alliance Chief Executive Mike Mudd. The government would cover 74 percent of FutureGen's costs, with the rest coming from a partnership of utilities and energy firms.LiNeBrEaKSince federal funding officially stopped in June, delays have increased the cost of the project by $10 million a month, Mudd said.LiNeBrEaKOn Wednesday, energy lobbyists and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged the incoming administration to invest heavily in coal-cleaning research. Almost half of the electricity generated in America comes from coal plants.LiNeBrEaK"Our country can choose the rational path of advancing technology that reduces CO2 emissions," Mudd said. "If we choose not to reduce the emissions, coal plants will still continue to be built in China and India."LiNeBrEaKAfter the Energy Department stopped backing FutureGen, the project continued to be supported in Mattoon. The community privately raised $3 million of $6. 5 million need to buy the 440 acres where the plant would be located.LiNeBrEaK"We've kept the project alive locally," said Angela Griffin, president of Coles Together, a local economic development organization. "There's been almost unanimous support from the community."LiNeBrEaKBuilding the plant would add as many as 700 construction jobs to Mattoon; the plant would employ 100 people.LiNeBrEaKJim Tankersley reported from Washington; Joshua Boak reported from Chicago.LiNeBrEaKjtankersley@tribune.comLiNeBrEaKjboak@tribune.com	COAL FIRED PLANTS (93%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (92%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (90%); POWER PLANTS (90%); 2008 ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN (90%); COAL INDUSTRY (90%); COAL MINING (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (87%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (87%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (86%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); NOBEL PRIZES (78%); CAMPAIGNS and ELECTIONS (78%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); LOBBYING (78%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (78%); CONSTRUCTION (77%); TALKS and MEETINGS (77%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (77%); PUBLIC FINANCE (77%); DELAYS and POSTPONEMENTS (76%); AWARDS and PRIZES (75%); TAX LAW (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (71%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (71%); MARKETING and ADVERTISING (67%); ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (72%); MARKETING CAMPAIGNS (65%); PLANT CONSTRUCTION (57%); US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009 (90%); OBAMA'S FIRST 100 DAYS (77%); US PRESIDENTS (89%); BUSINESS and PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (72%); ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (71%)  	BARACK OBAMA (94%); RICHARD DURBIN (93%); STEVEN CHU (71%)  	CHICAGO, IL, USA (73%) ILLINOIS, USA (95%) UNITED STATES (95%); INDIA (79%); CHINA (79%)  	January 8, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Chicago Tribune   	Jim Tankersley and Joshua Boak, Chicago Tribune  				Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	Construction  	20090108-TB-FutureGen-coal-plant-in-Mattoon-may-be-revived-0108  	TB  														
Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 8, 2009 Thursday 	Letters to the editor  	MY TOWN; Western Contra Costa; Alameda; Contra Costa; News; Local  	1127 words  	Tunnel project will have real impactsLiNeBrEaKThe Fourth Bore Coalition has stated repeatedly that it is not opposed to adding a fourth bore to the Caldecott Tunnel, but a project that will cost taxpayers $420 million should have had more thought put into how to maximize its benefits and minimize its impacts.LiNeBrEaKFrom an east-of-the hills perspective, where schools, parks, and residences are buffered from Highway 24's presence, the project appears to have few major downsides. But people in areas of Oakland and Berkeley that literally sit right next to the freeway are not so fortunate. LiNeBrEaKThe excavation and building of this three-quarter-mile-long tunnel will result in more than five years of round-the-clock construction. Caltrans completely failed to address the trucking and disposal of the thousands of cubic yards of rock to be bored from the tunnel, the noise and air quality impacts of that disposal, and the visual effects of building a 40-foot-high sound wall adjacent to more than 500 residential units.LiNeBrEaKResidences adjacent to the construction site will be subjected to five years of construction noise, light, and dust pollution, plus harmful diesel fumes that no sound wall will stop.LiNeBrEaKCaltrans considered long-term traffic operations along the entire length of Highway 24, yet refused to include analyses of the impacts on schools, parks, and residences sitting right next to the freeway, claiming they were too far from the construction site.LiNeBrEaKCaltrans belittles these concerns, despite current knowledge of the health effects of highway traffic.LiNeBrEaKCaltrans also refused to consider alternatives, such as using some of the new tunnel lanes for carpools and express buses. These alternatives could improve commute conditions in both directions, as well as reducing the project's contribution to global warming, air and noise pollution, and overall highway congestion.LiNeBrEaKCaltrans data predict the project will cause a 40 percent increase in afternoon westbound traffic along Tunnel Road, a major arterial to Highway 24, yet included no mitigations for this and impacts on other surface streets.LiNeBrEaKThe community groups that make up the Fourth Bore Coalition repeatedly tried to get Caltrans to give this important and expensive project more thought.LiNeBrEaKThe health and safety effects of the project could be easily avoided by Caltrans through project modifications. Our efforts, however, fell on deaf ears. The only remaining recourse was to ask the courts to intervene and require Caltrans to do what the law requires.LiNeBrEaKAnn SmulkaLiNeBrEaKBerkeleyLiNeBrEaKSmulka is the chairperson of Caldecott Tunnel Fourth Bore Coalition.LiNeBrEaKHamas is responsibleLiNeBrEaKIt is all too easy to have Israel's actions be the focus of headlines the last couple of weeks.LiNeBrEaKYes, the violence and deaths are truly terrifying in magnitude. But what of the Gazan weapons-smuggling tunnels, more than 40 of which have been destroyed by the Israel Defense Forces since Dec. 28?LiNeBrEaKWhat of the thousands of cell phone calls the IDF made to Palestinian civilians, warning them to stay away from militants in advance of the attacks?LiNeBrEaKCell phone warnings and avoidance of civilian deaths have not been the strategies of Hamas, the duly elected leadership in Gaza.LiNeBrEaKHamas is ultimately responsible for the horrible violence and death of these past weeks, having barraged Israel's southern region with smuggled weapons, instead of recognizing Israel's existence as a first step toward the peace we all seek.LiNeBrEaKHamas deserves the headlines and, thereby, the global accountability.LiNeBrEaKRabbi Menachem CreditorLiNeBrEaKBerkeleyLiNeBrEaKIsrael's bombing of GazaLiNeBrEaKFor the last few years, Israel has attempted to starve the people of Gaza by cutting off land and sea borders to food, medical supplies, and fuel.LiNeBrEaKIsrael bombed whole apartment blocks and sewage treatment plants. It expelled the U.N. rapporteur and kept journalists from entering Gaza. This slow torture and attempt to make the suffering invisible to the world apparently is not enough to keep Gazans from resisting their harsh treatment.LiNeBrEaKMaybe a new bag of tricks is needed. What else can get rid of these men, women, and children?LiNeBrEaKSince the ethnic cleansing of 1948 didn't work out so well (See Benny Morris' new book, "1948"), Israel has to try again for a final solution, a fight to "the bitter end."LiNeBrEaKMany of Gaza's inhabitants are the sons and daughters of those who became refugees in 1948 and 1967 with Israel's takeover, and now they are to be finally disposed of.LiNeBrEaKU.S.-supplied F-16s dropping hundreds of bombs on one of the most densely populated areas in the world will really help to bring peace. Maybe it will bring the silence of death. But until Israel recognizes the rights of millions of Palestinians, there will never be peace.LiNeBrEaKFor every Palestinian killed, a survivor will mourn and resist the occupation more intensely. Perhaps, that is what Israel wants: to fuel its war machine, as it is a lucrative business. The new terror bombing campaign should really do the trick.LiNeBrEaKMargaret FoudaLiNeBrEaKKensingtonLiNeBrEaKHamas is Gaza's enemyLiNeBrEaKLike Emily Wheeler, whose Jan. 2 letter was titled, "Horrific crime," the news from Gaza is breaking my heart. But not for the same reasons.LiNeBrEaKMy heart is breaking because of the firing of longer-range missiles by Hamas into Israeli cities far from the border. One hit a school; another hit a shopping center.LiNeBrEaKWheeler accuses Israel of "committing genocide" against the "indigenous people" of Gaza, but she doesn't care a bit that Hamas and its allies have indiscriminately fired more than 4,000 rockets and mortar shells into Israeli cities and towns since Israel left Gaza in 2005, killing and wounding Israeli civilians.LiNeBrEaKIsrael isn't committing genocide against anyone, but Hamas has been harming its own population by hoarding food, fuel, power, and money for its own fighters, while making the people of Gaza go without.LiNeBrEaKAnd by the way, Israel supplies Gaza with power and has continued to do so even during this latest fighting.LiNeBrEaKIt is Hamas, not Israel, that is the enemy of the Gazan people.LiNeBrEaKJoel AckermanLiNeBrEaKRichmondLiNeBrEaKIsrael's insanityLiNeBrEaKOne definition of insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly but expecting a different result.LiNeBrEaKDoes Israel really think that anything will improve by killing hundreds of Palestinians? Why wouldn't they expect the same in return?LiNeBrEaKBy contrast, the only time Israel agreed to a truce with Hamas, there were no casualties for almost six months, until Israel violated the truce in early December by killing four Palestinians.LiNeBrEaKWhy not sit down with Hamas and discuss their offer of complete peace in exchange for complete return of the West Bank and Gaza? How about the Saudi and Arab League initiatives for total peace in exchange for territorial withdrawal?LiNeBrEaKBut what can we expect? It's election time in Israel, and Palestinian blood always draws votes.LiNeBrEaKPaul LarudeeLiNeBrEaKEl Cerrito	TUNNEL CONSTRUCTION (90%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); NOISE POLLUTION (90%); BRIDGES and TUNNELS (90%); CONSTRUCTION (89%); VEHICLE TRAFFIC (87%); RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY (76%); AIR POLLUTION (73%); AIR QUALITY (73%); PARTICULATE MATTER (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (62%); SMUGGLING (60%)  		SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (94%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%); ISRAEL (92%); PALESTINIAN TERRITORY (79%)  	January 9, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved  	BAY AREA NEWS GROUP  																					
Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 8, 2009 Thursday 	letters to the editor  	MY TOWN; Alameda; Oakland-Berkeley; News; Local  	1030 words  	Embrace the four RsLiNeBrEaKRecent newspaper headline: "2 trillion tons of land ice ... gone ... NASA satellite data show latest signs of global warming."LiNeBrEaKReading further I was disheartened to learn the loss hadn't occurred over the last century, but instead happened in Greenland, Antarctica and Alaska just since 2003!LiNeBrEaKThe enormity and urgency of global warming can feel overwhelming, but we can't afford not to act. Instead of trying not to think about it or choosing not to change habits because we feel incapable of making a dent in the problem, let's each do what we can to help. The good news is many actions which reduce greenhouse gas emissions also conserve resources, which saves money. LiNeBrEaKSo let's each figure out how to drive less (carpool, walk, bike, take public transit, telecommute, etc.). Reduce electricity and natural gas usage by calling APandT (748-3947) to arrange a free home energy audit, and check out the APandT (www.alamedapt.com/electricity) and PGandE (www.pge.com/myhome/saveenergymoney) websites for tips and rebates. Embrace the four Rs of reduce, reuse, recycle and rot (compost/green bin). Buy locally grown and manufactured goods. Use a rake, broom and push mower.LiNeBrEaKIn an attempt to be helpful, I've created a two-page Alameda Global Warming Checklist and Resource List. See it at www.bikealameda.org/info/Global_Warming_Checklist.pdf or Google search "global warming checklist," first item listed.LiNeBrEaKGet involved in environmental projects. Join CASA, Community Action for Sustainable Alameda (www.casa-alameda.pbwiki.com or email www.saveourcityalameda.org.LiNeBrEaKPatricia RuppeltLiNeBrEaKFour areas of concernLiNeBrEaKLocating the Veterans Administration facility at Alameda Point can be a benefit to Alameda if the VA is willing to cooperate with the city, SunCal (the Alameda Point master developer) and the Navy in not only mitigating negative impacts but in actively working to become an asset to the city.LiNeBrEaKI have four areas of concern:LiNeBrEaKHow will the VA become involved in the city and SunCal's efforts to improve and increase the use of the public transit system serving both the needs within the island and in getting off the island?LiNeBrEaKHow will the VA facility integrate into the life of the new Alameda Point development and enhance the lives of people there?LiNeBrEaKHow will the Superfund site (IR 2) be cleaned to a level that will leave the land safe in perpetuity through earthquake, erosion, subsistence and rise in sea level?LiNeBrEaKHow can development of the facility protect the least terns? This might be a good time to examine instances and other places where the least terns have coexisted with human activity.LiNeBrEaKThis is an exciting opportunity. Let's hope this endeavor can be a benefit to all concerned.LiNeBrEaKJoan KonradLiNeBrEaKHOMES (Housing Opportunities Make Economic Sense)LiNeBrEaKReasons why notLiNeBrEaKRegarding the proposed $700 million in redevelopment bond subsidies to SunCal to build 4,500 homes on a base that's toxic. City workers drink bottled water at Alameda Point. Has our City Council gone over the edge? Are they completely out of touch with reality, or so naive they can't comprehend how ridiculous this is? Below are some of the reasons not to build homes:LiNeBrEaK1. Toxins are in the ground. The Alameda Journal stated the Navy has no plans to remove the toxins from that site.LiNeBrEaK2. There is a housing slump. Too many homes on the market. Some homeowners are either in foreclosure or carrying reverse equity mortgages.LiNeBrEaK3. We are in a drought. Citizens are not conserving water so the city can give it to someone new. We are conserving it so that existing EBMUD customers will have enough water.LiNeBrEaK4. Too much traffic. It takes about 45 minutes from Bay Farm Island to Interstate 880.LiNeBrEaK5. More emissions will not allow the city to be a "green city."LiNeBrEaK6. Our school board can't seem to administer its budget to handle the children going to school now. How are they going to pay for more students? They can't always rely on parcel taxes to fix their inadequacies.LiNeBrEaK7. The city cannot take care of the streets, sidewalks and other city services for the current citizen. Are we going to suffer so that they can provide better service to the new ones?LiNeBrEaK8. The city is proposing "brown-outs" for the Fire Department. How will they provide coverage for new homes, not take care of existing ones?LiNeBrEaK9. Homes don't bring revenue, businesses do. Alameda Point would make a great business park and perfect for a veteran's hospital. A great way to give back to our service people.LiNeBrEaKMarion MillerLiNeBrEaKHonor our veteransLiNeBrEaKWhat a surprise to see the amount of coverage given to the Ninth Annual Comcast Oakland Holiday Parade. The high number of persons in attendance also surprised me. I do not want to take away anything from it. It is a great annual event.LiNeBrEaKHowever, not a little earlier there was another parade of national importance which did not get the same type of coverage, and attendance was minimal. It serves as a day for an extended weekend, a nice trip or picnic. A few did take the time to attend an event honoring those who have served their nation.LiNeBrEaKArmistice Day is now known as Veterans Day. In the 11th month (November), on the 11th day (11), at the 11th hour (11 a.m.) in Hayward, this year's host city, the Alameda County 56th Annual Veterans' Parade, took place. The media was there   more television networks than newspapers. More than 20 veterans lined up to show their respect for our past, current and future veterans. The pride was evident on their faces, especially the few who are Pearl Harbor survivors, current veterans and those still serving. It was the right time for the people who came to recognize those who served and continue to serve, so we all can enjoy our freedom.LiNeBrEaKThere was some coverage   it was well hidden and not much was said. Former and current members of the armed forces should get equal or more coverage as the holiday parade on their day of honor.LiNeBrEaKWe should feel ashamed that there is no longer a desire to show respect and honor for those in the military. Some have paid the ultimate sacrifice to keep us free. I thank the few, about 1,500, who were there to honor our veterans on Veterans Day.LiNeBrEaKAs President Abraham Lincoln said, "Any nation that does not honor its heroes will not long endure."LiNeBrEaKRoberto A.

Daily Oklahoman  	January 8, 2009 Thursday 	The Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, David Zizzo column: Americans slice, dice throughout problems  	LIFESTYLE  	380 words  	Jan. 8--As economies around the world struggle and America's leadership undergoes sweeping change, it's hard to find time to peel a boiled egg. But wait, with the Eggstractor, that's no longer a problem! LiNeBrEaKThis amazing invention is so amazing, it should be on TV! Hey, it is. See, right on the box: "As Seen on TV." And, as we know from watching "Celebrity Circus," if something is on TV, it must be good. And it deserves an exclamation point! Or two!!LiNeBrEaKThe egg machine is one of many magically miraculous products demonstrated on TV by people who love espresso and superlatives. This cornucopia of entrepreneurial garage sale material was launched decades ago by Ron Popeil, a visionary who realized that what America needed to become the world's dominant superpower was the ability, at a moment's notice, to make julienne fries.LiNeBrEaKAnd before you could cut your hair with a vacuum cleaner, America had entered the age of Ginsu knives, commemorative coins and spray-on hair. If we needed spray-on nylons, the "Slanket" or a boxed collector pocket knife set featuring presidents from George Washington to George W., all we had to do was dial the 800 number on our screens.LiNeBrEaKInventors solved so many problems that Americans ran out of problems, other than health care, energy, global warming, war and that economy thing. So, inventors invented more problems so they could invent stuff to solve them. How do you carry a piano in your pocket, stash a vegetable strainer in a briefcase or cook 14 pieces of bacon at once in a microwave? (The rollup piano, the folding colander and the Bacon Wave.)LiNeBrEaKToday, America can awaken to an electric-shock alarm clock, get healthy with an electric-stimulating ab belt and stay that way with a UV toothbrush sanitizer.LiNeBrEaKBut, that's not all. Act now and you also get tickets to "Celebrity Circus"! Hurry, the first 400 callers get a garage sale permit!!

Detroit Free Press (Michigan)  	January 8, 2009 Thursday 	Bush won't impose tougher fuel rules  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	688 words  	Jan. 8--WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration declined Wednesday to put into place tough new fuel economy rules for cars and trucks, letting the incoming Obama administration decide how to balance cutting Americans' demand for oil with billions of dollars in new costs for struggling Detroit automakers.LiNeBrEaKIn a statement, the U.S. Department of Transportation said the industry's financial decline will require the Obama administration to conduct a thorough review of the fuel economy rules, and that the work already done should allow the next administration to finish ahead of an April 1 deadline set by the 2007 energy bill. LiNeBrEaKThe delay, widely expected by the industry, adds yet another variable to an uncertain outlook for 2009.LiNeBrEaK"Manufacturers need certainty, and this decision only further delays their ability to finalize future product plans," said Charles Territo, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. "We look forward to working with the Obama administration to provide them with any information they need to complete this rulemaking."LiNeBrEaKWhile President George W. Bush ordered the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to finish the fuel economy rules for the 2011 through 2015 model years by the end of 2008, the final rule has been stuck in limbo since November when regulators signed off on it.LiNeBrEaKPeople familiar with the new rule say it makes several changes to what the government had originally proposed, setting an average of 31. 8 m.p.g. for new vehicles by 2015, 0. 2 m.p.g. higher than the draft version.LiNeBrEaKBut the original rule was expected to cost the industry $47 billion to meet, with Detroit's three automakers forced to shoulder $31 billion of that cost. Automakers had sought several changes to the proposal, while environmental groups had said it should be stronger in the wake of $4-a-gallon gasoline last summer.LiNeBrEaKThose changes, along with the automakers' own move toward more efficient models, actually reduced the cost of the final rule to $36 billion industry-wide. Costs are not broken down by company.LiNeBrEaKJust as the rule was finished in November, Detroit automakers came to Washington seeking $34 billion in aid to survive one of the worst economic downturns in the industry's history. None expects auto sales to rebound this year from the 15-year lows hit in 2008.LiNeBrEaKObama and several members of his prospective cabinet support forcing the industry to comply with California's state laws limiting global warming pollution from vehicles, which automakers contend will act like state-by-state fuel economy rules. The proposed Bush administration rule claimed the federal standards overrode California law, a contention that several states and environmental groups have vowed to challenge in court.LiNeBrEaKWithout the rule, automakers will have to wait a number of months for the new administration to pick staffers and rework the standards. Given that the designs and fuel efficiency of most 2011 models have been frozen by now, any new rule will likely have to start with 2012, although the new administration could stretch out the years covered.LiNeBrEaKDan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, said the Obama administration should set standards of at least 35 m.p.g. by 2015 and 42. 5 m.p.g. by 2020. While the Bush rule was "far from perfect, it was a step forward and failure to issue it may delay the arrival of cleaner cars."LiNeBrEaKU.S. Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said he too wished the Bush administration had acted, given the serious problems facing the country.LiNeBrEaK"This may compel the new administration to do this with great haste, as opposed to great haste and great care, because both have to be done," said the Dearborn Democrat.LiNeBrEaKContact JUSTIN HYDE at 202-906-8204 or jhyde@freepress.com	AUTOMOBILE MFG (90%); AUTOMAKERS (90%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (90%); MOTOR VEHICLES (90%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (90%); REGULATORY COMPLIANCE (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); ENERGY REGULATION (78%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (78%); ECONOMIC DECLINE (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (76%); DELAYS and POSTPONEMENTS (75%); AUTOMOTIVE SALES (73%); ROAD TRANSPORTATION SAFETY (72%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (68%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (68%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%); US PRESIDENTS (90%)  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); GEORGE W BUSH (85%)  	DETROIT, MI, USA (94%) MICHIGAN, USA (94%); CALIFORNIA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (99%)  	January 8, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Detroit Free Press   	Justin Hyde, Detroit Free Press  	US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (58%); NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION (55%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	Automobiles/Highways  	20090108-DE-Bush-won-t-impose-tougher-fuel-rules-0108  	DE

LiNeBrEaKAlas, it is very expensive pixie dust.LiNeBrEaKBut the greenies don't care because they are on a mission to save the planet, and how can you put a price tag on that?LiNeBrEaKAnd now they have a governor who, recognizing the political payoff in battling carbon, is one with them.LiNeBrEaKThey collaborated with his Action Team on Energy and Climate Change to produce a glowing report on Crist's energy policies. These include a goal of getting 20 percent of our energy from renewable sources by 2020.LiNeBrEaK20 percent by 2020.LiNeBrEaKOur energy policy is based on a slogan.LiNeBrEaKIt certainly isn't based on reality. Neither is the action team's calculation that the policy somehow would save the state $28 billion.LiNeBrEaKThe staff of the Public Service Commission has taken a more serious look at the fiscal impact. And it says we could be paying surcharges of 10 percent or more on our electric bills in the next decade.LiNeBrEaKDon't misunderstand me. I'm a longtime greenie who often has supported plundering your wallet to make this world a better place.LiNeBrEaKBut doing so has to make sense. And this does not.LiNeBrEaKThe impression many people have is that we simply can tear down our power plants and replace them with solar cells and windmills.LiNeBrEaKIt's not that simple.LiNeBrEaKSay you build a new house and put solar cells on the roof. Good for you.LiNeBrEaKBut Progress Energy still has to back up that energy supply so you can fire up your plasma TV on rainy days and at night. It still has to build its nuclear power plant.LiNeBrEaKSo you basically are paying for redundant generating systems.LiNeBrEaKBecause solar cells work intermittently, we would have to put them on 70 percent of all existing houses by 2020 to meet Crist's energy goals using just the sun.LiNeBrEaKThis would require an immediate 4 percent increase in electric bills, with that number eventually climbing to 21 percent over the next 11 years.LiNeBrEaKWind power can be even more whimsical than the sun.LiNeBrEaKLook at it this way. Would you feel comfortable with your hospital ventilator plugged into a windmill or a solar cell? Or would you prefer a nuke or coal plant?LiNeBrEaKThe most reliable renewable energy comes from burning garbage, trees and other such forms of "biomass." But this would require cultivating up to 1. 3 million acres in combustible crops, an area about double the size of Orange County. Burning pine trees in power plants also could do to the price of wood what ethanol did to the price of corn.LiNeBrEaKFlorida now gets about 3. 5 percent of its energy from renewable sources. Multiplying that to 20 percent in only 11 years reminds me of the New Testament parable of the loaves and fishes.LiNeBrEaKAnd Charlie Crist's miracles are limited to his favorable ratings.LiNeBrEaKPlease, do not brand me as a denier. I do believe. I believe our carbon combustion has contributed to the earth spinning like a rotisserie chicken.LiNeBrEaKWhat I don't believe is that anyone can accurately predict what this will mean 20 years from now. I also don't believe meeting some arbitrary deadline will determine whether the ocean rises to swallow Miami Beach. Or if that would be a bad thing.LiNeBrEaKFlorida's cost of living has reached the breaking point for many people. Progress Energy customers are getting hit with a 25 percent rate increase this year. OUC also is raising rates.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, the recession is roaring, with Florida a national leader in job losses, foreclosures and collapsing government budgets.LiNeBrEaKNow is not the time to pile on.LiNeBrEaKThe PSC staff wants to cap renewable-energy rate increases at 2 percent, which could mean putting off the 2020 date until 2041.LiNeBrEaKThat's more reasonable and the earth will not be any warmer for it.LiNeBrEaKThe longer phase-in would allow us to take advantage of new technologies as they emerge, rather than throwing up whatever is available in the next few years.LiNeBrEaKDoing this right is more important than doing it fast.

Philadelphia Inquirer (Pennsylvania)  	January 8, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: Protecting oceans  	COMMENTARY  	329 words  	Jan. 8--George W. Bush, as president, has protected more ocean waters than anyone in history.LiNeBrEaKWere that his sole entry in the environmental record, he would be hailed as one of the all-time best friends of the Earth. But his exemplary acts to protect the world's waters were never duplicated to clear the air. LiNeBrEaKBush was late to acknowledge the impact of greenhouse gases on climate change, and he wouldn't take strong measures to limit CO2 emissions in the United States. That will be left to the next president.LiNeBrEaKStill, Bush deserves a great deal of appreciation for his efforts to protect marine life. He issued an executive order Tuesday that safeguards 195,280 square miles of the Pacific Ocean as three separate marine national monuments.LiNeBrEaKThe president's directive, using powers granted to him under the Antiquities Act of 1906, will restrict oil and gas exploration and commercial fishing around numerous remote U.S.-controlled islands in the central and western Pacific. Recreational fishermen must apply for permits to fish in the protected areas.LiNeBrEaKThis week's declaration follows Bush's similar directive in 2006 that created a 138,000-square-mile marine national monument in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands.LiNeBrEaK"It has taken 137 years, since the creation of America's first national park in Yellowstone in 1872, to recognize that unique areas of the world's oceans deserve the same kind of protection as we have afforded similar places on land," Joshua S. Reichert of the Pew Environment Group told the Washington Post.LiNeBrEaKAnd it's all because of George Bush.

The Providence Journal (Rhode Island)  	January 8, 2009 Thursday 	Rhode Island, 10 other states form compact to reduce emissions  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	598 words  	Jan. 8--Rhode Island has joined 10 other Northeast and Middle Atlantic states in agreeing to set common standards to reduce the greenhouse gases emitted by fuels burned for transportation and heating. LiNeBrEaKThe ultimate goal is to require fuel distributors to lower the carbon content of fuels used in Rhode Island and the other states in the compact. The distributors could use their own initiatives to meet the standards.LiNeBrEaKOverall carbon emissions could be reduced by using more biofuels and electric energy or using strategies to reduce miles traveled by vehicles.LiNeBrEaKThe state has agreed to negotiate a memorandum of understanding as to how to set the standards by the end of the year.LiNeBrEaK"All we're really achieving here is to collectively define expectations and to regionally put us forth on this path," said W. Michael Sullivan, director of the state Department of Environmental Management. He signed the document committing Rhode Island to the initiative.LiNeBrEaK"If we do this right, it's not something that changes tomorrow or next spring," Sullivan said. But, he said, it puts Rhode Island in step with many of its neighboring states.LiNeBrEaKThe 11 states are the same as those who are participating in the new Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, plus Pennsylvania. Other participants are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Vermont.LiNeBrEaKThe RGGI states are trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by requiring generators of electricity to buy carbon credits to match their carbon output. Eventually, the states will require carbon reductions by the generators. Two auctions for the credits have been held so far, and deemed successful by outside monitors. The auctions have raised about $145 million, which will be distributed to participating states for energy-efficiency projects.LiNeBrEaKElectricity generation is a big producer of gases that contribute to global warming. But Sullivan said transportation generates even more gases, so it is important to find ways to reduce emissions from that sector.LiNeBrEaKLast year, Governor Carcieri announced that Rhode Island intends to adopt the strict automobile emission standards promulgated by California to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The automakers have been fighting that initiative in court.LiNeBrEaKJoining the other states in setting carbon fuel standards is the second step toward reducing emissions from vehicles, Sullivan said.LiNeBrEaKThe regional agreement was announced this week by Ian Bowles, secretary for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs.LiNeBrEaKBowles, in a statement, said, "Working together, the 11 states from Maine to Delaware will cut greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks, spur the development of clean-energy technologies like advanced biofuels and electric cars, and reduce our dependence on petroleum."LiNeBrEaKA letter of intent signed by the participating states notes that the interconnected nature of fuel distribution in the Northeast and the Middle Atlantic region makes a regional approach easier to implement. It also commits the states to working with other states and the federal government to influence possible federal standards on a broader scale.

The Register Guard (Eugene, Oregon)  	January 8, 2009 Thursday 	Piercy's priority: jobs  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	858 words  	Jan. 8--Kitty Piercy on Wednesday kicked off her second term as Eugene mayor, naming job creation as the city's priority for the year.LiNeBrEaKDuring her fifth State of the City address, Piercy said Eugene should seek federal economic stimulus money to create local jobs.LiNeBrEaK"That is our first order of business," Piercy said before an audience that filled the lobby of the Hult Center for Performing Arts. LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama has indicated that he wants to get an economic stimulus package through Congress quickly to help the nation's ailing economy, she said.LiNeBrEaKEugene has more than $200 million "ready to go" construction, street repair, alternative energy, parks, trails, water reuse and pollution control projects, she said.LiNeBrEaK"We expect these projects, if funded, could create 4,404 well-paying jobs by the end of next year, with an emphasis on green industry," Piercy said.LiNeBrEaKEugene officials should maximize the potential share of federal money by coordinating their funding request with Lane County and other local governments, utilities, business leaders and legislators, she said.LiNeBrEaKAlso, city officials should collaborate with regional government and business leaders on other economic development ideas, she said. Those include the need to help existing local businesses "survive these difficult economic times," Piercy said.LiNeBrEaKTo do that, Piercy said she has spoken with other councilors and the city manager to begin talks with regional government officials, business leaders and others.LiNeBrEaK"That is our second order of business," she said.LiNeBrEaKThe city should develop a "progressive economic plan," starting with an economic summit early this year involving regional government and business leaders and others.LiNeBrEaK"We cannot wait for what will be allotted," Piercy said, referring to the federal economic stimulus money. "We must go after what we want for our communities: more jobs that pay well, decrease our impact on climate change and finite resources, and take full advantage of the changing world economic opportunities."LiNeBrEaKLane County Board Chairman Pete Sorenson, who attended Eugene's event, said county commissioners also have made economic development a priority and have already discussed an economic conference involving leaders from Eugene, Springfield and other cities. "We are working on the summit and on ideas to get people employed," he said.LiNeBrEaKPiercy won re-election in November, defeating former Mayor Jim Torrey by 1,638 votes. Before she gave her speech, Piercy was sworn into office for a second, four-year term by City Recorder Mary Feldman. Also taking the oath of office were re-elected city councilors Andrea Ortiz, Chris Pryor, Betty Taylor and newly elected Councilor George Brown.LiNeBrEaKPiercy made sustainability, or environmentally friendly businesses and practices, the cornerstone of her first term. The city made progress by creating the city's Sustainability Commission and adopting its recommendation for city government, including the goal of making city operations carbon neutral by 2020, she said.LiNeBrEaKPiercy touted other city accomplishments, including last year's successful Olympic Track and Field Trials, voter approval of the $35. 9 million street repair bond measure, and a charter amendment that solidifies the city's commitment to the police auditor and Civilian Review Board.LiNeBrEaKBut Piercy acknowledged setbacks last year, and that problems persist.LiNeBrEaKEugene has yet to secure a new full-service hospital to fill the void left by the opening of Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend in Springfield, she said.LiNeBrEaKBut she thanked the group of local doctors who opened an urgent care on East 13th Avenue.LiNeBrEaKWestTown on Eighth opened last year, bringing new residents and businesses downtown. Yet Piercy said too much of the city center "remained underutilized and uninviting."LiNeBrEaKThe county's financial problems have led to a shortage of beds in the Lane County Jail and the early release of prisoners, she said.LiNeBrEaKAgain, Piercy called for collaboration with Lane County to restructure the public safety system.LiNeBrEaK"We cannot have this revolving door in our jail and a court system that cannot do its job," she said.LiNeBrEaK"We must go after what we want for our communities."LiNeBrEaKACTIVISTS WILL PRESENT A CITIZENS STATE OF THE CITY AND COUNTYLiNeBrEaK--Purpose: To present "policies, priorities and visions to address converging economic, energy and ecological crises."LiNeBrEaK--When: Noon on MondayLiNeBrEaK--Where: Harris Hall, Lane County Public Service Building, 125 E.

Richmond Times Dispatch (Virginia) 	January 8, 2009 Thursday   Final Edition	Conservative Columnist Can't See Opportunity  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A-8  	266 words  	Editor, Times-Dispatch: LiNeBrEaK I wonder if Walter Williams is aware that his recent Op/Ed column, "Global Warming Rope-a-Dope" is a litany of distortions? Williams cites a Senate Minority Report of 650 scientists who dispute human-caused climate change - but does he know that the report was compiled by Marc Morano? Is Williams aware that Morano is anything but objective (and that the same can be said of many of the industry-paid scientists Morano cites)? LiNeBrEaK Morano's career includes a long stint as Rush Limbaugh's producer, and he was midwife to one of the nastiest and most biased political attacks in our history - the Swift Boat ads of 2004. Morano is a political operative whose job is to promote his, or his employer's, viewpoint. Who might be his employer in this case? James Inhofe, senator from the great state of ExxonMobil.LiNeBrEaK For a moment, let's pretend that Morano and Williams are right and climate change is not human-caused. Regardless, we still need to move away from rapidly depleting fossil fuels to renewables to secure our nation's place in the world. The more fossil fuels we use, especially oil, the more the petro-dictators of Saudi Arabia et al. grow stronger and richer.LiNeBrEaK We are currently fighting a war against the very forces that we enrich with our energy money; I'd rather my nation-building money build my nation.LiNeBrEaK Finally, there are huge opportunities in the renewable energy market that American ingenuity can exploit so that we are once again leading the world's innovation curve. Williams is so conservative that he can't see opportunity when it's right in front of his nose.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia)  	January 8, 2009 Thursday 	Harnessing methane gas: Startup hopes to make cash from trash: Green KW Energy plans to harness methane from a Montgomery County landfill.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	698 words  	Jan. 8--CHRISTIANSBURG -- A green energy company believes it can make a little money for itself and help local government and the environment by making electricity from landfill gas.LiNeBrEaKThe lease has been signed for Green KW Energy to install a generator fueled only by the gas rising from within the Mid-County Landfill off Cinnabar Road in Christiansburg.LiNeBrEaKThe Montgomery Regional Solid Waste Authority attracted Green KW after an investigation revealed the closed landfill, holding 1 million tons of household and commercial waste deposited mostly during the 1980s and 1990s, will ooze a naturally occurring gaseous mixture containing flammable methane for the next 15 years. LiNeBrEaKThe authority currently burns the methane to keep it from being released as an agent of global climate change.LiNeBrEaKBut that's old technology.LiNeBrEaKAt a cost of $350,000 to $400,000, Green KW plans to install a methane-fired engine and generator atop the landfill rated to produce 265 kilowatts of electricity. That's enough to power about 100 homes.LiNeBrEaKCompany and utility officials think there might be enough gas for a second generator of similar size.LiNeBrEaKThe Green KW venture will be a small renewable energy project within the well-established landfill gas-to-electricity arena.LiNeBrEaKThe Environmental Protection Agency said 456 such projects operate in the United States, 20 of them in Virginia.LiNeBrEaKMany of the existing Virginia projects are between four and more than 20 times as productive as the one being proposed in Christiansburg, because they are situated on larger landfills burping out more gas.LiNeBrEaKBut Steven Cox, the president of Green KW and a professor of engineering at Virginia Tech, said the objective is not just profit -- though profit is expected during the first year of operation.LiNeBrEaKThe Green KW team, with scientific and business backgrounds but no track record in alternative energy, is starting out with a small, challenging first project before pursuing larger ventures at other landfills and at sewage treatment plants, which produce gas, too.LiNeBrEaKHere's how Cox got involved.LiNeBrEaKCox said he has taken his students to visit many landfills. Each time, he has noticed a blazing gas flare burning off the landfill gas.LiNeBrEaK"You see the flare and you ask, 'Can't something better be done with this?' " he said.LiNeBrEaK"No, we've tried," he was told over and over.LiNeBrEaKBut then he visited a Kentucky landfill with its own 2. 4 megawatt electrical generator with a single operator.LiNeBrEaK"That was the motivator," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe company was incorporated in November 2007 and consists of Cox, who will operate the plant on a part-time basis; Cox's wife, Carrie, also an engineer; Tech engineering professor John Novak; Virginia Military Institute engineering professor Charles Bott; and Bott's wife, Caroline, a public administrator with experience in government and not-for-profit enterprises.LiNeBrEaKGreen KW has set aside $10,000 for the authority if its efforts fall short.LiNeBrEaKBut, assuming electrical generation gets under way as planned later this year, it will pay the authority a fraction of the money it receives for the electricity it sells.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, the authority and Green KW both expect to earn salable, green-energy credits.LiNeBrEaKThe authority expects its direct payments to reach at least $15,000 a year and to reserve the money for environmental education and training, said Alan Cummins, executive director.LiNeBrEaKHe said he did not know of any sights, smells or sounds from the project that will be offensive to residents, and key players expect the Department of Environmental Quality to grant the necessary permitsLiNeBrEaK"This whole project, I see it as a win-win," Cummins said. "A win, win, win."LiNeBrEaKThat's because the project will bring value from the environmentally harmful landfill gas while getting rid of it in safe manner, produce cash and advance public education.

That's enough to power about 100 homes.LiNeBrEaKCompany and utility officials think there might be enough gas for a second generator of similar size.LiNeBrEaKThe Green KW venture will be a small renewable energy project within the well-established landfill gas-to-electricity arena.LiNeBrEaKThe Environmental Protection Agency said 456 such projects operate in the United States, 20 of them in Virginia.LiNeBrEaKMany of the existing Virginia projects are between four and more than 20 times as productive as the one being proposed in Christiansburg, because they are situated on larger landfills burping out more gas.LiNeBrEaKBut Steven Cox, the president of Green KW and a professor of engineering at Virginia Tech, said the objective is not just profit -- though profit is expected during the first year of operation.LiNeBrEaKThe Green KW team, with scientific and business backgrounds but no track record in alternative energy, is starting out with a small, challenging first project before pursuing larger ventures at other landfills and at sewage treatment plants, which produce gas, too.LiNeBrEaKHere's how Cox got involved.LiNeBrEaKCox said he has taken his students to visit many landfills. Each time, he has noticed a blazing gas flare burning off the landfill gas.LiNeBrEaK"You see the flare and you ask, 'Can't something better be done with this?' " he said.LiNeBrEaK"No, we've tried," he was told over and over.LiNeBrEaKBut then he visited a Kentucky landfill with its own 2. 4 megawatt electrical generator with a single operator.LiNeBrEaK"That was the motivator," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe company was incorporated in November 2007 and consists of Cox, who will operate the plant on a part-time basis; Cox's wife, Carrie, also an engineer; Tech engineering professor John Novak; Virginia Military Institute engineering professor Charles Bott; and Bott's wife, Caroline, a public administrator with experience in government and not-for-profit enterprises.LiNeBrEaKGreen KW has set aside $10,000 for the authority if its efforts fall short.LiNeBrEaKBut, assuming electrical generation gets under way as planned later this year, it will pay the authority a fraction of the money it receives for the electricity it sells.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, the authority and Green KW both expect to earn salable, green-energy credits.LiNeBrEaKThe authority expects its direct payments to reach at least $15,000 a year and to reserve the money for environmental education and training, said Alan Cummins, executive director.LiNeBrEaKHe said he did not know of any sights, smells or sounds from the project that will be offensive to residents, and key players expect the Department of Environmental Quality to grant the necessary permitsLiNeBrEaK"This whole project, I see it as a win-win," Cummins said. "A win, win, win."LiNeBrEaKThat's because the project will bring value from the environmentally harmful landfill gas while getting rid of it in safe manner, produce cash and advance public education.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	January 8, 2009 Thursday 	Governor, Democrats collide over environmental exemption for Hwy. 50 project  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1030 words  	Jan. 8--With the clock ticking toward insolvency, talks on fixing California's budget this week hit a bottleneck on Highway 50 in Rancho Cordova -- where officials are at odds over the state's iconic and controversial environmental protection law.LiNeBrEaKBecause of the jobs it would create, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is pushing for a fast-track launch this spring of a project to build a seven-mile-long carpool lane between Sunrise Boulevard and Watt Avenue. LiNeBrEaKThe Highway 50 project and nine other state highway expansions would boost California's sagging economy, Schwarzenegger said.LiNeBrEaKTo speed those projects, the governor wants them exempted from further review under the California Environmental Quality Act, and to give them immunity from future lawsuits.LiNeBrEaKBut legislative Democrats, led by Sacramento's Darrell Steinberg, the Senate president pro tem, argue that such exemptions would undermine the landmark law and dilute California's leadership in the fight against global warming.LiNeBrEaKThat highway fight is one of several state budget issues the governor and legislators failed to settle this week.LiNeBrEaKThey say they have given some ground in negotiations, but insist the state complete a full, court-ordered environmental review of the Highway 50 project.LiNeBrEaKThe state law in question, the monumental 1970 environmental quality act, requires large projects to be analyzed for potential adverse impacts on the environment and on surrounding communities, and requires steps be taken to blunt them.LiNeBrEaKThe act is credited with giving the public more say over large-scale projects in California and with reducing air pollution and other environmental degradation.LiNeBrEaKBut the law has long been criticized by some public officials and developers for causing delays and increasing costs, and for opening projects to lawsuits.LiNeBrEaKDespite the stalemate, Schwarzenegger pressed forward this week in a letter to President-elect Barack Obama, asking him to ease federal environmental requirements on a number of major projects.LiNeBrEaKIt's all about helping the economy, Schwarzenegger administration officials argue.LiNeBrEaKThe state faces a historic $40 billion budget imbalance over the next 18 months. State Controller John Chiang has warned the government will run out of cash as early as February and would have to start issuing IOUs for some bills if a deficit-closing deal isn't concluded before then.LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger this week rejected an $18 billion, one-year fix proposed by Democrats. The governor counter-proposed a $40 billion balancing act for the entire projected 18-month deficit -- including quick starts on the highway projects.LiNeBrEaK"We're in the economic doldrums as a state," state Department of Transportation head Will Kempton said. "One of the best ways is through immediate creation of jobs. The notion is to get a certain amount of work out the door as soon as possible."LiNeBrEaKKempton said the highway projects already have had some environmental review, and that Caltrans would be diligent in dealing with environmental issues during construction.LiNeBrEaK"We are not talking about backing away from our environmental standards," Kempton said.LiNeBrEaKThe 10 projects, worth $1. 2 billion, would generate 22,000 jobs, he said.LiNeBrEaKPlanning and legal experts say the governor's attempt to circumvent environmental law is not new.LiNeBrEaK"When times get tough, it is almost predictable you will hear some people say let's streamline, repeal or exempt projects from CEQA," Sacramento environmental law attorney Jim Moose said.LiNeBrEaKHe and William Fulton, publisher of the California Planning and Development Report, say they have seen the governor and Legislature exempt projects during emergencies, such as floods and earthquakes, but not as a means to stimulate the economy.LiNeBrEaKDemocrats and environmentalists contend Schwarzenegger's proposal would do little to boost the economy.LiNeBrEaKInstead, they said, it will be a setback for California's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.LiNeBrEaK"I think it sets a horrible precedent," said Eric Davis of the Environmental Council of Sacramento.LiNeBrEaKDavis called it a cynical move by a governor who has promoted himself as a champion for the environment and wants California to set international standards for reducing global warming gases.LiNeBrEaK"We urge the governor to return to his earlier principles that the economy and the environment are compatible," said Warner Chabot, head of the California League of Conservation Voters.LiNeBrEaKDemocrats and environmentalists say they are particularly concerned about the governor's efforts to pre-empt two ongoing environmental lawsuits.LiNeBrEaKOne involves a $420 million fourth bore for the Caldecott Tunnel on Highway 24 in the East Bay hills.LiNeBrEaKA local group has sued Caltrans for not doing enough to handle adverse impacts, including added noise and traffic in surrounding areas and pollution effects on nearby schools.LiNeBrEaKA judge is expected to issue a ruling shortly.LiNeBrEaKThe other, the $165 million Highway 50 carpool project through Rancho Cordova, has become a cause cel&Atilde;&uml;bre among environmentalists.LiNeBrEaKLocal residents and environmental activists sued Caltrans last year, claiming the agency did not adequately study, among other things, the possible increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which are linked to global warming.LiNeBrEaKIn July, Sacramento Superior Court Judge Timothy Frawley ruled Caltrans' environmental review was inadequate and needed to be redone. It is believed to be the first court ruling on a transportation project to use global warming as a legal backdrop.LiNeBrEaKCaltrans officials said they are redoing the environmental review to include greenhouse gas studies while they await the outcome of the state budget negotiations.LiNeBrEaKThat additional review could take more than a year, local Caltrans district head Jody Jones has estimated.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Tony Bizjak, (916) 321-1059.

San Antonio Express-News 	January 8, 2009 Thursday   METRO Edition	Energy farm along coast starting to harvest wind  	A SECTION; Pg. 1A  	880 words  	SARITA - Wind power, long a staple on the gusty plains of West Texas, officially made its mark on the Gulf Coast on Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKAfter years of battling environmentalists worried about the mixture of towering windmills and one of the world's busiest migratory bird flyways, Babcock and Brown opened its wind farm on the Kenedy Ranch.LiNeBrEaKThe wind farm will sport a bird radar detection system that company officials tout as the first of its kind. The system can automatically stop the blades if the potential for a mass bird kill is detected. Crews currently are running 16 windmills to test the system, but in a month all 118, each standing as high as a 40-story building, should be producing power. The total 283 megawatts will be enough to power 80,000 homes. LiNeBrEaK"People don't think of Texas when you're talking about the granola, green, renewable crowd," said Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson at the opening of the wind farm. "But this is just energy. We are in the energy business."LiNeBrEaKBabcock and Brown's $700 million wind farm is one of two in sparsely populated Kenedy County. The other, owned by the Spanish company Iberdrola, is adjacent to Babcock and Brown's.LiNeBrEaKIt's also in the process of cranking up its wind turbines, and both plan to expand later this year. When Babcock and Brown adds 200 megawatts and Iberdrola completes its expansion, the farms' combined 900 megawatts will create the largest concentration of wind power in the world, said Babcock and Brown's John Calaway.LiNeBrEaKWind power long has been a favorite of many environmentalists because it produces energy without producing air pollution or the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. And Texas easily leads the nation in wind power production with as much as 9,000 megawatts.LiNeBrEaKBut the Kenedy County projects, which are the first wind farms on the Texas Coast, have produced mixed feelings in the environmental community and driven a wedge between the Kenedy Ranch and its neighbor, the iconic King Ranch.LiNeBrEaKThat's because the Texas Coast is an important migratory bird route and home to thousands of acres of environmentally sensitive wetlands.LiNeBrEaKIn response, several bird advocacy organizations and the King Ranch formed the Coastal Habitat Alliance to fight the wind farms.LiNeBrEaKThe group is petitioning the Federal Aviation Administration to require environmental studies, but it already has failed in its attempts in federal court, the Public Utility Commission and in the state's administrative courtLiNeBrEaKCalaway, who described the often-bitter battle as "a pretty bloody tough situation," said Babcock and Brown has gone above and beyond to protect the environment. The windmills and the roads on the wind farm have been built to avoid the wetlands, he said. And radar crews plotted the flights of birds in the area for three years before determining that most flew far higher than the windmill blades, which reach 419 feet off the ground.LiNeBrEaKThe radar and shutdown system is a precaution against the unlikely event of a weather system forcing birds down into the blades, Calaway said.LiNeBrEaK"This project is going to set the example for environmental stewardship," he said.LiNeBrEaKKilling a migrating bird is illegal, according to the international Migratory Bird Treaty Act, said Dawn Whitehead of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife's Corpus Christi office. And although her office can take action if birds are killed, because the project is on private property, it can't stop the project or require environmental analysis.LiNeBrEaKWhitehead said her biologists have been to the property a "couple of times" since 2005 and have reviewed wildlife reports produced by Babcock and Brown's consultants. She also is trying to formalize an agreement to regularly review the wind farm's bird monitoring data and create an avian and bird protection plan.LiNeBrEaK"At first blush it would seem a risky project," Whitehead said. "But they really did a lot of work, so we'll just have to wait and see."LiNeBrEaKMost of the state's wind power is produced in West Texas, which generally is windier than the coast. But Calaway said the coastal wind, particularly that between Corpus Christi and the Mexican border, has the advantage of blowing in the afternoon, when the power is most needed. West Texas wind generally blows at night.LiNeBrEaKThe coast also is attractive for wind farms because, unlike West Texas, there's also transmission capacity on the coast to move the power. The state has approved a $5 billion transmission project to eventually alleviate the bottleneck in West Texas.LiNeBrEaKThis combination of factors has created interest in more coastal wind projects, said several people in the industry. E.ON Climate and Renewables has announced plans to build a wind farm in San Patricio County and has an agreement to sell the power to San Antonio's CPS Energy, which also is buying power from the Iberdrola farm in Kenedy County.LiNeBrEaKCompanies have contacted the Electric Reliability Council of Texas about the possibility of building wind farms on the coast capable of producing thousands of megawatts of power, said Mike Sloan of Austin's Virtus Energy, a renewable energy consulting firm. But many of these are likely to never make it out of the planning stages.LiNeBrEaK"You've got a lot of people looking on the coast," he said. "But there might be environmental issues that knock some of those projects out."

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 8, 2009 Thursday   FINAL Edition	U.S. far behind in green tech revolution, senators told;  BATTLE AGAINST GLOBAL WARMING 	Main News; Pg. A1  	1232 words  	 Silicon Valley venture capitalist John Doerr, whose early investments helped launch Google and Amazon, delivered a stark warning to Congress on Wednesday that the United States is on the verge of being left behind in the green tech revolution.LiNeBrEaKDoerr, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, which is betting billions on clean energy technologies, told senators that two of his firm's biggest investments were with foreign firms because U.S. companies did not have the most advanced technology. Of the top 30 companies in solar, wind and advanced batteries, just six are U.S. firms.LiNeBrEaK"Notice the trend here," Doerr told members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. "We won the space race with the Soviet Union. Now as New York Times columnist Tom Friedman says, we're in an Earth race with other nations to see who can invent the technology so that men and women can stay on Earth. And we are not winning today." LiNeBrEaKBut Doerr and other evangelists of green technology believe the environment could change under President-elect Barack Obama, who has pledged to make tackling global warming a top priority. Doerr has been meeting with Obama's transition team and leaders in Congress to urge them to use the new economic stimulus package to modernize the electric grid and offer new incentives to help clean energy startups get off the ground.LiNeBrEaKDoerr was invited to speak by California Sen. Barbara Boxer, who chairs the committee, along with Friedman, the author of a new book, "Hot, Flat and Crowded," which calls for a green tech revolution to solve the country's climate, energy and foreign policy challenges. They spoke at a policy briefing, not a formal hearing, but most of the committee's Democrats stopped by. None of the panel's Republicans attended, a sign of the continuing partisan split on Capitol Hill over how to address global warming.LiNeBrEaK'American Nothing'LiNeBrEaKFriedman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and columnist, echoed Doerr's assessment by showing a slide of a billboard advertisement in South Africa by Daimler for its new uber-efficient smart car, the ForFour. "German Engineering, Swiss Innovation, American Nothing," the billboard reads.LiNeBrEaK"Someone actually thought that the best way to sell their product was to advertise that it had 'American Nothing' inside," Friedman said. "That billboard actually pisses me off on many levels ... because I think it's wrong. But it does reflect a view out there, a view that I feel strongly about. We need to get our groove back as a country."LiNeBrEaKFriedman noted that as he travels the country, he's constantly handed business cards by innovators working on a new cellulosic biofuel or other clean energy technology, reflecting his view that America is actually "bursting with innovation" around energy and climate change.LiNeBrEaK"If I were to draw a picture of America today, it would be a picture really of the space shuttle taking off. You know, all of this incredible thrust coming from below," he said. "But in our case the booster rocket - Washington, D.C. - has been cracked and leaking energy. And the pilots in the cockpit are still fighting over the flight plan."LiNeBrEaKInvestors hamstrungLiNeBrEaKSeveral Democratic senators acknowledged that Congress' failure to pass a climate-change bill has hamstrung investors and entrepreneurs working on clean-energy solutions. LiNeBrEaK"America increasingly gets it about the consequences of climate change," said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. "Somehow this building seems to be sort of the last redoubt of people who don't seem to get it."LiNeBrEaKDoerr, who has been a major donor to Democratic candidates and causes and a close ally of former Vice President Al Gore, now also a partner at Kleiner Perkins, said the single most important thing Congress can do is to pass legislation, either through a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax, that puts a price tag on emitting carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. Doing so would make cheap, high-carbon energy - especially coal - more expensive while making investment in wind and solar power more affordable for utilities.LiNeBrEaKFriedman agreed. "We can only innovate our way out of this problem by shaping the marketplace with the right rules, incentives and price signals to stimulate the kind of innovation we need - which is 10,000 innovators in 10,000 garages trying 10,000 things," he said.LiNeBrEaKDoerr gave Congress a detailed list of recommendations, including new tax incentives for renewable energy, a huge boost in federal research and loan guarantees to help clean energy startups survive the "valley of death" - which is venture-capital-speak for the period between the lab and the marketplace, when many promising technologies die for lack of funding.LiNeBrEaKKleiner Perkins, which invests for a select group of foundations and universities, has invested $600 million in 45 green tech startups, and Doerr said the firm will invest in at least 40 more over the next two years. Venture capitalists poured more than $1. 8 billion into clean energy ventures in California last year and about $5 billion into green tech projects nationwide.LiNeBrEaK$6 trillion industryLiNeBrEaKFriedman pointed out that the figure is just a tiny fraction of the $80 billion that was invested during the height of the information technology revolution in 2000. Doerr noted that many investors are still waiting for new federal policies and incentives to jump in. But they sense a huge opportunity in the energy industry, valued at $6 trillion annually with 4 billion customers worldwide, he said.LiNeBrEaK"It is the mother of all markets - perhaps the largest economic opportunity of the 21st century," Doerr said.LiNeBrEaKObama has shared some of the optimism, suggesting that investments in clean energy could create millions of new jobs and help pull the country out of recession. After Wednesday's briefing, Boxer said many of Doerr's ideas are likely to make it into the new stimulus plan and future legislation.LiNeBrEaK"America pulled itself out of the Great Depression by mobilizing to fight World War II," she said. "Now, in order to break out of this deep recession ... we must mobilize again."LiNeBrEaKJohn Doerr's 5 recommendations for Congress LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKThe legendary Silicon Valley venture capitalist made five recommendations to Congress and President-elect Barack Obama to jump-start a green-tech revolution and fight global warming: LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKModernize the grid: As part of the economic stimulus package, Doerr said Congress should invest in a more efficient electric grid that can deliver solar and wind power to consumers across the country. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKPut a price on carbon: A cap-and-trade system and a carbon tax that's refunded to taxpayers could drive up the costs for coal plants and make low-carbon sources, wind and solar, more competitive. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKA national renewable energy standard: Doerr believes the federal government should follow California and two dozen other states that require utilities to generate more of their power from renewable sources. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKNew incentives for utilities: California utilities will spend $3 billion on energy-efficiency measures over the next 18 months because state rules give companies major incentives to conserve energy. New federal rules could force other states to follow suit, he said. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKMore federal energy research: The federal government spends less than $1 billion a year on renewable energy research. Doerr urged more federal research and loan guarantees to help new technologies get off the ground.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	January 08, 2009 Thursday 	IN 2009, IT'S ALL ABOUT GREEN  	BUSINESS; Pg. C6  	967 words  	"WHY CAN'T WE have Christmas the whole year a-round?" asks the refrain of a popular seasonal song. To which the answer is, "But you can have Christmas the whole year round - and twice on the Fourth of July - provided you say the magic word."LiNeBrEaKWhat word? Change? Hope? Bailout? Oh, please - those are so 2008. LiNeBrEaKInfrastructure? That's a perennial favorite, and it's going to be even more popular in 2009.LiNeBrEaKBut the magic word you really need is this: Green.LiNeBrEaKAs in green jobs, green energy, green products, green business, green cars, green homes, green buildings, green agriculture, green lifestyle, green infrastructure (a double bonus!). ...LiNeBrEaKAnd more importantly, green as in lettuce, cabbage, bucks, greenbacks, moolah, dinero, dead presidents, lucre (preferably not filthy), bread, boxes of ziti (a reference for you "Sopranos" fans), wampum. ...LiNeBrEaKIn 2009, you can have plenty of the latter kind of green as long as you can attach the former meaning to whatever you're doing.LiNeBrEaKThe more cynical observers of the current scene might note that this hardly seems a new or novel observation. Attaching "green" to anything, no matter how tenuous the connection, is so established a fad as to be almost clich&eacute;d and tiresome.LiNeBrEaKToo true. But you ain't seen nuthin' yet.LiNeBrEaKThe prevailing sentiment combined with the new administration and Congress will only accelerate and intensify the push for all things green, at a pace and size to make the defense and highway appropriation bills positively Scrooge-like in their generosity by comparison.LiNeBrEaKAnd in this land of opportunity, even the dullest operator is likely to take notice when opportunity not only knocks but offers to back up the truck and unload copious amounts of swag.LiNeBrEaKWill any of that reduce energy consumption, cut pollution, develop new sources of energy, increase fuel supplies and lower their cost, improve national energy security by increasing energy independence, generate jobs and a new sector of economic activity or combat global warming or global climate change or whatever they're calling it this week? What are the unintended consequences of spending on these projects?LiNeBrEaKWho knows?! Who cares?! If you say it's green, that's good enough for us!LiNeBrEaKAnd who gets to pay for the largess about to be showered in the name of green? Go find a mirror - if you can see your reflection in it, or fog it with your breath, there's your victim.LiNeBrEaKTaxpayers and consumers have been through this before, with mad rushes of spending being justified by the altruistic mantra, "But it's for the children." This time, though, "It's for the Earth."LiNeBrEaKIt's not that the taxpayers and consumers don't want to do something nice for the planet, or their country, or themselves, or that they expect every dollar spent to have an immediate and identifiable return. Technological development by its nature is full of false starts, dead ends, promising leads that turn into busts and ideas that don't work until their fourth or fifth iteration. The only way to find out what works is to take the risk of spending on what proves not to.LiNeBrEaKBut they're also not wrong to desire a little less haste and a little more discretion as to how the dollars are strewn about.LiNeBrEaKThe amounts aren't small. Consider what the state of Oregon is proposing to hand out in just one instance. The newsletter Energy Prospects West reported last month that the state may extend $15 million in cash and $4 million to $5 million in work force training grants, business energy tax incentives and transportation and infrastructure improvements to wind-turbine manufacturer Vestas to locate its North American headquarters in Portland.LiNeBrEaKNor are the consequences of ill-considered green spending cheap, as illustrated by last summer's boom and subsequent bust in actual and proposed investment in ethanol production, and the unforeseen impacts on food prices. All that served to do was to sour lots of people on the prospects for liquid biofuels and burn a lot of dollars from investors and consumers (although it was a nice couple of months for corn producers).LiNeBrEaKThere have been some voices calling for caution. A recent report from economists at Washington State University on the potential for biofuels advised against direct incentives for potential feedstock crops as corn, sugar beets and canola, saying those wouldn't be cost-effective. Instead it suggested encouraging the use of existing supplies of biomass, including forest, logging and agricultural residue and municipal solid waste. The report also recommends a renewable fuels fund with revenue from a carbon emissions tax, itself a hugely controversial and complex issue.LiNeBrEaKBut are we likely to get such a studied, measured, thought-out approach? That will be the story of 2009.LiNeBrEaKThe prospects are not encouraging. Aside from the meanings already explored, green has a few more. There's green as in greenhorn, meaning inexperienced and gullible. Those with a pitch to sell are going to spot a live one - in this case government with dollars practically falling out of its pockets - coming from miles away.LiNeBrEaKThen there's green with envy, a description of those in the green sector who see what is being handed out to banks, Wall Street, the auto industry and other self-proclaimed worthy causes and figure they'd like a slice of that, too.LiNeBrEaKThere's even green as in green around the gills, i.e. nauseated, which is what a lot of taxpayers and consumers are going to be when they see how much has been spent for so little accomplishment.LiNeBrEaKIt's not easy being green? Sorry, Kermie. In 2009 not only will being green (or professing to it) be easy, it will be mandatory, unavoidable and - depending on what side of the transaction you're on - downright lucrative.

The State (Columbia, South Carolina)  	January 8, 2009 Thursday 	Heavy hitters weigh in to oppose coal plant  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	570 words  	Jan. 8--Conservationists who oppose a mega-coal plant near Florence brought in reinforcements Wednesday to fight the $2. 2 billion Santee Cooper project.LiNeBrEaKThe Sierra Club's national coal campaign director, Bruce Nilles, said the state-owned utility is out-of-step in pushing the new plant.LiNeBrEaK"Why is Santee Cooper wanting to take the state in one direction when the rest of the country is rapidly moving in the other direction?" Nilles asked. LiNeBrEaKGeorgia, Kansas and Iowa are among states that have slowed efforts to develop coal plants, he said during a news conference to rally support against the South Carolina facility. Meanwhile, Northeastern states are trying to reduce pollution from existing plants, he said.LiNeBrEaKState-owned Santee Cooper says it needs the plant because it can't meet the state's electricity needs in the near future through conservation and efficiency, as environmentalists contend.LiNeBrEaKLaura Varn, a spokeswoman for the utility, said the project has the blessings of state environmental regulators and South Carolina isn't the only state weighing a new coal plant.LiNeBrEaKStill, the proposed facility has caused a stir in South Carolina. It would release 93 pounds annually of toxic mercury into the air along the Great Pee Dee River, where some fish are unsafe to eat because of mercury pollution.LiNeBrEaKFlorence Mayor Stephen Wukela and state environmentalists said the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control was wrong to issue a major air permit for the plant, knowing the toll it could take on the landscape.LiNeBrEaKThe DHEC board this morning will discuss an appeal by environmentalists. Other environmental permits are pending.LiNeBrEaKIf Santee Cooper wins its fight for the plant, the increased carbon emissions will offset efforts by Northeastern states to reduce carbon dioxide from power plants by 24 million tons annually, the Sierra Club's Nilles charged . The Santee Cooper plant is one of the largest new coal plants proposed nationally in the past six years, he said. It is expected to send nearly 10 million tons of carbon dioxide into the air each year for 50 years.LiNeBrEaKBarbara Gottlieb, a representative of Physicians for Social Responsibility, said she's also glad to help fight the 1,320-megawatt power station. The physicians group is a national organization seeking to stop global warming. The Sierra Club is one of the nation's top environmental groups.LiNeBrEaKNilles and Gottlieb visited Columbia at the request of the S.C. Coastal Conservation League and others. About 30 groups are interested in joining a broader campaign against the plant, said Dana Beach, the league's director. The league and the others hired the Ferillo and Associates public relations firm to help. They announced a Web site Wednesday, scsaysno.com.LiNeBrEaKLewis Gossett, who chairs the pro-business group Citizens for Sound Conservation, said coal plant opponents want to limit growth.LiNeBrEaK"It's appropriate that the coalition announced today by those opposed to the Pee Dee power plant is called SC Says No," he said.LiNeBrEaKReach Fretwell at (803) 771-8537.

The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	January 8, 2009 Thursday 	Parasite fatal for popular city owl  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	438 words  	Jan. 8--ALBANY -- The snowy owl that made appearances around downtown Albany in recent weeks, thrilling bird-watchers and first-time viewers, has died. LiNeBrEaKThe owl was found on a rooftop on Broadway Avenue on Tuesday afternoon and was brought to the Department of Environmental Conservation. DEC wildlife pathologist Ward Stone said the white-faced bird was carrying a fatal parasite called Trichomonas gallinae.LiNeBrEaK"It had a lot of mouth lesions, which is caused by the Trichomonas parasite," Stone explained. "It was probably acquired from eating a pigeon with a pathogenic strain."LiNeBrEaKStone said it is common for owls that come into the city to become ill from eating city rodents and pigeons. Typically, owls, which are not migratory birds, will fly south only when food in their native Arctic region is scarce.LiNeBrEaK"Oh, that is so sad," said Susan Watson-Ames when she heard the news of the owl's death. Watson-Ames works in the SUNY System Administration Building, across from where the snowy took up its perch last week.LiNeBrEaK"It was such a beautiful bird that I couldn't take my eyes off of it," Watson-Ames recalled. A steady stream of employees in her building had lined the sidewalk to see the snowy. "I had let people know about it," said Watson-Ames. "I was like the town crier."LiNeBrEaKStone said it is likely the snowy died sometime Sunday or Monday. It usually takes a couple of days, and possibly up to a week, for a bird to die from the parasite.LiNeBrEaK"It is a shame that this beautiful bird is dead," said Stone, who partially attributed global warming to the owl's death because it can disrupt plant growth and prey populations.LiNeBrEaK"If global warming impacts severely on the Arctic and sub-Arctic, we can expect dramatic declines in the population of the snowy," Stone said. He will continue to study the owl to make a full determination of the cause of death.LiNeBrEaKWatson-Ames, who had made a mental note a few days ago to keep a look out for the snowy, hopes she'll get to see another.LiNeBrEaK"I mean, this was so rare," she said. "In a way it was like a sign of some sort. There's a saying if you see an owl, it's a bad thing, but if you see a snowy owl, it's good luck."

The Washington Post 	January 8, 2009 Thursday   Suburban Edition	Bush Leaves Fuel Economy Targets for Obama to Set  	FINANCIAL; Pg. D02  	497 words  	Citing "recent financial difficulties of the automobile industry," the Bush administration said it would not issue interim targets for higher vehicle fuel efficiency, leaving it up to the incoming Obama administration to steer auto companies toward better mileage standards. LiNeBrEaKDemocrats and environmental groups had mixed reactions, on the one hand criticizing the Bush administration for dragging its feet while on the other welcoming the chance for the new administration to set its own guidelines.LiNeBrEaKThe guidelines must be issued no later than April 1 so auto companies have time to engineer 2011 models. "Now more than ever automakers need certainty, and this decision only further delays their ability to finalize future product plans," said Charles Territo, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.LiNeBrEaKLegislation enacted in 2007 raised the corporate average fuel efficiency standard to 35 miles a gallon by 2020, up from the current level of 27. 5 miles a gallon. To sweeten the deal for auto companies, Congress adopted a $25 billion loan program for advanced technologies.LiNeBrEaKThe Transportation Department was given responsibility for setting targets for the intervening years. Last fall, the department circulated a proposal that was more aggressive than some analysts had expected, requiring auto companies to build new cars averaging as much as 31. 8 miles a gallon by 2015. But final guidelines were not issued.LiNeBrEaK"While the Bush administration ran out of gas implementing the fuel economy law, with a new Obama administration we expect it to be full speed ahead towards ending our dependence on oil," said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming. "Once again the Bush administration has blown it on the environment," said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign. But Luke Tonachel, vehicles analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said this "gives the Obama administration an opportunity to move quickly under the nation's clean air and energy laws to raise fuel economy and cut heat trapping pollution from new cars and trucks."LiNeBrEaKHigher fuel efficiency for cars has been a priority for many members of Congress, who have pushed the carmakers to build more fuel-efficient vehicles if they are to expect federal aid to avoid bankruptcy. In addition, the state of California is pressing for a waiver from the federal government so it can set standards for automobile tailpipe emissions that would effectively set more stringent mileage guidelines.LiNeBrEaKBarclays Capital auto analyst Brian Johnson said that meeting the interim targets in the Transportation Department's draft proposal should not be difficult for automakers.LiNeBrEaK"It's really the 2020 standards that were more of a stretch," he said. The goals for 2014, he said, could be met "with turbo chargers and a modicum of hybrids." More widespread use of turbo chargers could boost fuel efficiency by as much as 20 percent, he said.

Austin American-Statesman (Texas) 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday   Final Edition	Waste not  	LIFESTYLE; Pg. D01  	1214 words  	Quick, look in your refrigerator. If you were to clean it out, how much of it would you have to throw away?LiNeBrEaKIf it's anything like my fridge, you have Tupperware containers of this month's leftovers and probably half a dozen fruits and vegetables that are past their prime. And if you count the remains of last night's dinner stinking up the trash can, you're looking at several pounds of wasted food in your kitchen.LiNeBrEaKThe waste in your home is likely repeated in millions of other American households. Then think about every unfinished plate at restaurants across the country and thousands of buffet lines, grocery stores and dining halls at closing time.LiNeBrEaKAll told, Americans throw out between 25 and 50 percent of the food produced in this country, according to estimates. On the conservative side, that's more than $100 billion worth of food going to landfills every year. LiNeBrEaKWasted money isn't the worst of it, says writer Jonathan Bloom, who blogs at wastedfood.com and is working on a book about the subject. That food rotting in landfills, because it isn't decomposing with the help of oxygen, is creating millions of tons of methane gas, which scientists say is more than 20 times as harmful as carbon dioxide to our atmosphere. Eighteen percent of what goes into landfills is food, and landfills are the largest human-related source of methane.LiNeBrEaK"People who grew up after World War II don't value food the same way as those who lived through the Depression, when rationing happened and people had to grow their own food. Wasting food was (seen as) helping the enemy," Bloom says. "The stakes are even higher (today) if you talk about global warming."LiNeBrEaKOver the course of this year on these pages, we'll explore ways people are reducing food waste at workplaces, schools, restaurants, cafeterias and dining halls. Prompted by my own New Year's resolution to waste less food, we'll also focus on what we all can do at home to cut down on the amount of food we throw away.LiNeBrEaKEven though there is more food waste at the commercial level, widespread change almost always starts at home. "In the household setting, people have power to affect change and reduce the amount of food that gets sent to landfills," Bloom says.LiNeBrEaKIt's a matter of breaking habits we've collectively been forming over the past 60 years. Bloom points out that the government isn't seriously studying this issue; the last major report was in 1997 based on data from 1995.LiNeBrEaKRaising awareness of the copious amounts of wasted food just might be a silver lining of the sinking economy. "People are paying attention more," he says, especially since food and commodity prices skyrocketed last year. "They want to make sure they stretch (the food) out and get all the use they can from it," he says.LiNeBrEaKBloom says about 25 percent of the food we bring into our homes isn't eaten, which totals on average more than 450 pounds a year per household. Estimates are that about 15 percent goes in the trash and another 10 percent into garbage disposals. By curbing the amount of edible food thrown away, Bloom says families could save hundreds of dollars a year.LiNeBrEaK"If people would just think about the amount of food they end up tossing, take a week and look at what ends up in the wastebasket, they will be able to see how much they are wasting."LiNeBrEaKHere are some ways to cut down on the amount of food you waste:LiNeBrEaK* Shop wisely. Make a meal plan, create a grocery list and stick to it. Take stock of what you already have before buying more. The grocery store is not a place for wishful thinking. Be realistic about what you are going to cook and, more importantly, eat. One survey found that more than 60 percent of food that goes bad in households is from people planning recipes they never actually make. Don't buy what you think you should eat or what you wish you had time to cook, Bloom says. If you're not in the habit of cooking laboriously during the week, plan a special recipe for a weekend night and then go shopping on Thursday or Friday.LiNeBrEaKMost of the time, fruits and vegetables from the grocery store have been in transit for a week or more, which means they will go bad faster than produce bought from local sources right after they are picked. If you can, go to the store more frequently and buy fewer items - just what you know you'll cook and eat in the next few days.LiNeBrEaKFood waste is particularly hard to avoid if you're cooking for one. Food, especially meat and produce, is often packaged for several servings, so it's hard to use it all up before it goes bad. Use the freezer to protect those extra servings or cook it all and then freeze.LiNeBrEaKThe bulk bins in stores can help. ("It should be called the custom food aisle," Bloom says, because you can buy as little as you need.) Or order at the deli counter, where you can ask for three slices of cheese or a third of a pound of meat. You might even find a store that will sell you half of a head of cabbage or just a few celery stalks.LiNeBrEaK* Cook wisely. Don't whip up a huge pot of soup right before you leave town for a few days. Serve reasonable portions; people can always get seconds, Bloom says. Save - and eat - leftovers. "So many people put off wasting for a week, but a week later, they find the Tupperware that isn't looking so good," he says.LiNeBrEaK* Compost. With a well-kept composting system, food scraps can decompose into a rich soil amendment in a matter of months. Food in landfills can take up to 20 years to break down. I've started a pile on the ground in my backyard and covered it with a large container. After saving my food scraps for just a few weeks, the pile outgrew the container, so I've made a cylinder with chicken wire in which to throw scraps and yard clippings (leaves, grass trimmings, etc.). To encourage decomposition, keep the pile moist and stir it up every week or so. Worms likely will find their way to your pile, which to them is better than any Las Vegas buffet. You also can buy worms from just about any gardening center. (For more detailed information about composting and starting your own garden, check out the new "Gardening 101" series on the Austin360 blog Renee's Roots, www.austin360.com/reneesLiNeBrEaKroots.)LiNeBrEaKApartment dwellers and nongardeners can drop off their scraps at the downtown farmers' market, which last weekend started putting out a 55-gallon barrel for people to fill with composting materials. The refuse will go to one of the market's farmers, who will use it to help grow more food.LiNeBrEaK* Make reducing waste a household project. Talk about what each member of your family can do to reduce their personal food waste. Teach your children the value of food by involving them in the shopping, cooking and composting of food. Ask them how much of their lunch they end up throwing away at school. Show family members how to repurpose leftovers by making frittatas or stews.LiNeBrEaK"It's easy to discount the impact that you, as an individual, can make," Bloom says. "At the same time, if everyone thought that way, we'd never accomplish anything. Whenever the idea of reducing or composting food waste seems unlikely to catch on, I think of how recycling was a foreign concept 20 years ago."LiNeBrEaKabroyles@statesman.com; 912-2504 See how easy it is to turn food scraps and leftovers-gone-bad into rich fertilizer in a backyard compost pile on austin360.com/food.

Bangor Daily News (Maine)  	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	Grant to help study of iron, copper in ocean water  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	730 words  	Jan. 7--ORONO, Maine -- Two University of Maine scientists and a colleague from Colby College in Waterville recently received a $1. 3 million grant for their work on technology that measures iron and copper in ocean water and could have implications for climate change research.LiNeBrEaKThe four-year National Science Foundation grant allows professors Mark Wells and Carl Tripp of UMaine and Whitney King of Colby to develop a small sensor which can be attached to a mooring, a drifting float or to underwater gliders. The third option is ideal, Wells said, because gliders are controlled remotely and their data-gathering sensors can run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. LiNeBrEaKWells, Tripp, King, UMaine doctoral graduate Cuihong Jung and doctoral candidate Eric Roy have spent the past three years developing a nanostructured surface technology that binds iron from seawater. The grant will help refine the surface so it can be incorporated into a prototype sensing device for use on ocean-observing platforms.LiNeBrEaKThe sensor is actually a 1 -- centimeter-by-1-centimeter film of an organic molecule that is made from bacteria. The film binds with iron from seawater and allows scientists to analyze iron levels. Copper levels also can be measured, although not to the extent of iron.LiNeBrEaK"It's a film we can put on different [surfaces]," said Wells, a professor of oceanography in the school of marine sciences. "That is something which has eluded many people for a long time. It's a major jump forward in trying to analyze things found in ocean waters."LiNeBrEaKWells said the sensors eventually could be used on something such as the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System, known as GoMOOS, a buoy system that has a partnership with UMaine. Eventually, the data gathered from the sensors could be sent back to researchers by cellular or satellite technology.LiNeBrEaKThe process now used to measure iron and copper requires that samples be collected individually from large research vessels and analyzed in a laboratory.LiNeBrEaKIron and copper are metals important for sustaining the natural growth of phytoplankton, the tiny oceanic plants that serve as the foundation of marine ecosystems.LiNeBrEaKPhytoplankton also sequester carbon dioxide, the predominant greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. Scientists who model climate change examine phytoplankton levels in the ocean because they've found that the more phytoplankton, the lower the levels of carbon dioxide. Low levels of iron would indicate low levels of phytoplankton.LiNeBrEaK"There is some indication that copper might be involved but there is really no question now that iron is involved," Wells said. "Climate change scientists need a lot more data about iron concentration in the ocean and how that iron changes over time."LiNeBrEaKThere are plenty of ways to take measurements of, say, temperature and salinity, and there are relatively easier ways to measure levels of nutrients in water. The challenge in measuring iron is in its extremely low levels.LiNeBrEaK"That's a big challenge because iron in the open ocean is at very, very low levels," Wells said. "To put it in perspective, we must measure a drop of food coloring added to an Olympic-size pool. The difference between a drop and half a drop could have major consequences for how much carbon dioxide phytoplankton can sequester."LiNeBrEaKThe researchers tested the film over the past few years in the Gulf of Alaska, which is known to have particularly low iron levels. The results mimicked the numbers found in already accepted testing methods, Wells said.LiNeBrEaKThe next step for the group is developing a different type of surface on which to place the film in order to maximize the water flow by the sensor. The researchers also are hoping to miniaturize the whole system, which is now the size of a steamer trunk, to the size of a shoebox or even a cell phone.LiNeBrEaK"Certainly [the grant will help] make a lot of progress toward it," Wells said. "There's every reason to be optimistic."LiNeBrEaKjbloch@bangordailynews.net	OCEANS (91%); GRANTS and GIFTS (90%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (90%); OCEANOGRAPHY (90%); RESEARCH (90%); SCIENCE FUNDING (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); FOUNDATIONS (78%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (78%); HEAVY METALS and TOXIC MINERALS (77%); SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS (77%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%); SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY (69%); NANOTECHNOLOGY (68%); BACTERIA (66%); EMISSIONS (65%); GRADUATE and PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS (78%)  		MAINE, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 7, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Bangor Daily News   	Jessica Bloch, Bangor Daily News, Maine  	UNIVERSITY OF MAINE (84%); NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (58%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	Education  	20090107-NG-Grant-to-help-study-of-iron-copper-in-ocean-water-0107  	NG  														
Bangkok Post (Thailand)  	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	Survey predicts job growth  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	461 words  	Jan. 7--Despite the global slowdown, the Office of Small and Medium Enterprises Promotion (Osmep) expects to see more than 25,000 new SME operators creating more than 200,000 jobs this year. LiNeBrEaKAccording to Osmep, some industries such as medical services, processed food, paper products, education and logistics services are expected to perform better this year than last. The 2009 forecast is based on Osmep's survey of 4,200 SMEs nationwide.LiNeBrEaKSMEs expect negative factors this year will be political instability, contraction of the United States economy leading to lower investment, fluctuations of exchange rates and crude prices, lower global purchasing, higher competition, and new trade barriers such as climate-change rules.LiNeBrEaKThe survey predicts 25,340 new SMEs operators to emerge with 13,029 operators closing. That would add 12,311 operators to the sector, a 0. 53 percent increase from the current 2. 42 million SMEs.LiNeBrEaKThe survey predicts 229,799 jobs to be created from new businesses with 120,466 positions lost from closures. The resulting 109,333 jobs will add 1. 24 percent to the current 9. 28 million SME workers.LiNeBrEaKProducts and services offered will rise by 1. 335 trillion baht to 6. 02 trillion baht with export volume increasing 5. 06 percent to 1. 8 trillion baht, according to the survey. But SMEs will see their average profit drop by 7. 97 percent due to more competition and less demand.LiNeBrEaKThe manufacturing sector should see profits decline 5. 38 percent to 94. 6 billion baht, especially in the electronics, shipbuilding and furniture sectors. In the service sector, a 15. 93 percent reduction in profit margin down to 74. 37 billion baht is expected mainly from construction and financial leasing businesses.LiNeBrEaKThe slump in real estate and tourism should cause service sector revenue to drop by 0. 24 percent to 1. 75 trillion baht.LiNeBrEaKBut the manufacturing sector will see total revenue rise by 3. 06 percent to 2. 62 trillion baht led by growth in processed food, especially starch products such as noodles and grain oils.LiNeBrEaKOsmep expects processed food products, spa and health services, information and technology consultancy and telecommunications businesses to find success as well as an increased ability to pay back loans. But for electronic parts and appliances, machinery tools, hotels, restaurants and the entertainment business, 2009 will be a difficult year.

Birmingham News (Alabama) 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	Expert: Obama to get early foreign policy tests Professor cites Mumbai attack, Gaza incursion, Pakistan-India  	LOCAL NEWS; Pg. 2B Vol. 121 No. 300  	455 words  	Although President-elect Barack Obama has pledged to tackle the nation's domestic issues, particularly the economy, he will likely find himself quickly having to deal with things abroad, according to a George Washington University professor. LiNeBrEaK''Presidents are always foreign policy presidents,'' said James Goldgeier. ''Crises emerge and presidents always have to deal with them.''LiNeBrEaKGoldgeier, speaking to the Kiwanis Club of Birmingham on Tuesday, cited the terrorist attacks in Mumbai with their spin-off strain on India-Pakistan relations and the current Israeli incursion in Gaza as examples. He noted that both of those situations have developed in the short time since the election.LiNeBrEaKThe speaker is co-author of ''America Between the Wars: From 11/9 to 9/11,'' a look at the decade between the end of the Cold War and the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. His collaborator is Derek Chollet.LiNeBrEaKAmong the challenges Obama will likely face outside U.S. borders are:LiNeBrEaK--&gt; Ongoing developments in Afghanistan, and subsequently Pakistan, with American military efforts being increased in that area. Related to that is the relationship between Pakistan, ''a ticking time bomb for U.S. foreign policy,'' and India.LiNeBrEaK--&gt; China and the rise of other Asian countries in a wide range of activities. ''Other than climate change, nothing else will dominate U.S. foreign policy more for the next 20 to 30 years,'' he said.LiNeBrEaK--&gt; Global institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization have become somewhat obsolete or even dysfunctional because they were created after World War II in a totally different set of circumstances.LiNeBrEaK--&gt; The ongoing tension in Palestine and the broader Middle East.LiNeBrEaKGoldgeier said all of those issues will be colored by changes that occurred during the decade between the fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989 and the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. They include the growth of terrorism and global warming.LiNeBrEaK''The place Europe holds in foreign policy changed dramatically,'' he said, noting that Europe had been the dominant focus of U.S. foreign policy since before the Revolutionary War. Other areas such as the Middle East and China command more attention now. Despite that change, Goldgeier said America will still have close ties with Europe, which is very pro-Obama at this point.LiNeBrEaK''Europeans are extremely excited about the new president. They are happy to see the incumbent (George W. Bush) move back to Texas. This is exciting and intriguing for them but it is also a challenge for them. They know that what happened on Nov. 4 could only happen in the United States. It could not have happened in Germany or France,'' he said.LiNeBrEaKEMAIL: bplott@bhamnews.com	INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (94%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); MUMBAI TERRORIST ATTACKS (90%); TERRORISM (89%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (77%); SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACK (76%); GLOBAL WARMING (71%); WORLD WAR II (69%); COLD WAR (77%); US PRESIDENTS (90%)  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); GEORGE W BUSH (50%)  	BIRMINGHAM, AL, USA (92%); MUMBAI, INDIA (88%); BERLIN, GERMANY (79%) ALABAMA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (96%); INDIA (94%); PAKISTAN (94%); EUROPE (94%); ISRAEL (92%); PALESTINIAN TERRITORY (92%); MIDDLE EAST (92%); CHINA (92%); AFGHANISTAN (79%); ASIA (79%); GERMANY (79%); FRANCE (79%); NORTH AMERICA (79%); CENTRAL EUROPE (52%)  	January 8, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Birmingham News All Rights Reserved  	BILL PLOTT News staff writer  																					
The Boston Globe 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday   THIRD EDITION	ONE DIP TOO MANY? As polar plunges proliferate, organizers fear being frozen out  	METRO; Pg. B1  	792 words  	The shock of plunging into frigid water, which the L Street Brownies have endured and enjoyed for 105 consecutive New Year's Days, has failed to toss cold water on a toe-numbing lark that used to be relegated to the hardy or foolhardy few.LiNeBrEaKNow, some organizers wonder whether an escalating number of polar plunges will hurt fund-raising for those charities that embraced this big chill long before its popularity heated up. LiNeBrEaKMainers scheduled at least nine plunges this winter, including three on New Year's Day and one Jan. 2. Rhode Island had at least 10 on New Year's Day. And Massachusetts, among its year-opening activities, hosted the granddaddy of them all in South Boston, plus smaller plunges in Swampscott, Bourne, and Fairhaven.LiNeBrEaK"My feeling is there are enough dippers to go around, but there may not be enough pledgers to go around," said Phil Geelhoed, president of Special Olympics Maine, which hosted its 21st annual Lobster Dip on New Year's Day in Old Orchard Beach.LiNeBrEaKThe dip in 9-degree temperatures attracted more than 300 entrants, Geelhoed said, and set a new revenue record of just under $52,000 for the oldest winter plunge in Maine. The organization expanded its advertising this time to draw participants, who each raised a minimum of $100 in pledges.LiNeBrEaKOn Jan. 2, a smaller crew raced, or tiptoed, into the water off East End Beach in Portland, where the Natural Resources Council of Maine held its first plunge to raise awareness and money for the fight against global warming.LiNeBrEaKJudy Berk, a spokeswoman for the council, said she did not expect any competition for swimmers, who each raised a minimum of $50.LiNeBrEaK"We expect the people who are very committed to the environment," Berk said. "Some people don't think that environmentalists like to have fun. But, obviously, we do."LiNeBrEaKSaturation, however, could pose problems as Polar Plunges proliferate, said Michael Nilsen, national spokesman for the Association of Fundraising Professionals.LiNeBrEaK"It's part of a larger trend of these offbeat fund-raising events," Nilsen said, "particularly among the younger generation, who like doing more than sending in a check."LiNeBrEaKAlthough registered charities in the United States have soared from 375,000 in 1986 to about 1. 1 million today, Nilsen said, the souring economy will take a toll even among committed supporters.LiNeBrEaK"At some point, it's going to be too much," Nilsen said.LiNeBrEaKBut Steven Biondolillo, whose Wellesley company helps nonprofits develop special fund-raising events, has a different take.LiNeBrEaKAs a recession continues, Biondolillo said, events that focus on smaller pledges, such as walkathons and polar plunges, often do well because donors are apt to know someone who is suffering financial hardship.LiNeBrEaK"People in the community can actually see or feel some of the distress being experienced around them," Biondolillo said.LiNeBrEaK"To give $10 more is not that big of a deal. The bigger the amount of money, though, the more squeamish people seem to get."LiNeBrEaKPolar plunges are new enough, Biondolillo said, that the jury is out on whether expansion will dilute their fund-raising potential.LiNeBrEaKWalkathons, which attract people committed to a cause, continue to boom.LiNeBrEaKBut occasionally, Biondolillo said, so-called extreme events attract participants solely because of the demanding activity. And if enough of these events are held close together, the pool of available, paying entrants can be stretched thin.LiNeBrEaKCompetition was not a worry for the L Street Brownies, who used donations to benefit a South Boston scholarship fund. Joining the Brownies were more than 60 swimmers who raised money for Joey's Plunge, which benefits a Maine camp for children with life-threatening injuries and their families.LiNeBrEaKThe plunge was the brainchild of Joey Cerato, 14, who created the event as a way to raise money for Camp Sunshine in Casco, Maine, where his family has volunteered. Spurred by the success of the first plunge, when Joey was 11, Camp Sunshine now benefits from eight winter swims at sites from Maine to Virginia, plus a new one this season in Seattle.LiNeBrEaKJoey, of Hudson, N.H., said he tries not to think about the impending shock until the morning of the swim.LiNeBrEaK"It's wicked cold, but it's worth it," Joey said.LiNeBrEaKThat sentiment was echoed by Chris Bartorelli, 11, of Randolph, who planned to take his first plunge in South Boston on New Year's Day with 500 other daredevils.LiNeBrEaKChris, who has attended Camp Sunshine, has an aggressive form of spinal cancer. But doctors cleared him for the dip, and Chris sounded upbeat and unafraid as he prepared.LiNeBrEaK"I'm going to run in just to get in, and get out as fast as I can," Chris said. "It'll be cold, but it'll make me feel good."LiNeBrEaKSIDEBAR:LiNeBrEaKPLUNGE PROLIFERATIONLiNeBrEaKPLEASE SEE PDF FOR CHART DATA.

The Boston Globe 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday   THIRD EDITION	46 win rights for power plant gas emissions 10-state coalition offers allowances for carbon dioxide  	BUSINESS; Pg. B7  	437 words  	Local power companies, as well as major financial organizations and oil companies are among more than 80 potential bidders that were approved to participate in a recent auction of allowances that give area power plants the right to emit greenhouse gases. LiNeBrEaKThe auction is part of a so-called cap-and-trade program implemented by a 10-state coalition known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative of which Massachusetts is a member. The group's aim is to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases from power plants over the next decade. The effort is being closely watched by Congress, as well as by environmentalists and officials worldwide.LiNeBrEaKBut winning entities were not identified and it is not clear which of the potential bidders - including National Grid, Barclays Bank PLC, Merrill Lynch Commodities Inc., and Shell Energy North America - participated in the mid-December auction. There were 69 bids, and 46 won allowances, with bids ranging from a minimum of $1. 86 per allowance to a high of $7. 20, according to an auction report released yesterday by RGGI Inc., the initiative's nonprofit corporation.LiNeBrEaKEach allowance, of which there are a limited number, represents one ton of carbon dioxide. Power plants in the RGGI region, which stretches from Maine to Maryland, must buy an allowance for every ton of the greenhouse gas they emit, or find a way to reduce such emissions.LiNeBrEaKThis was the second RGGI auction, and the first time bidders were named. Many were companies regulated by the greenhouse gas emissions reduction effort, which Derek Murrow, director of policy analysis for the nonprofit advocacy group Environment Northeast, called "a good sign."LiNeBrEaK"I was struck by the fact that 80 percent of the bids were from compliance entities, which means that the market is dominated by power plants," Murrow said of the auction, which raised more than $100 million.LiNeBrEaK"We're really pleased," he added. "It's clearly raising significant new funds [that the states will use] for energy-efficiency programs."LiNeBrEaKRepresentatives of National Grid and Dominion Power, the largest power generator in New England, said their companies submitted bids in last month's auction. Neither offered specifics, though Bob Teetz, National Grid's director of environmental management, said the utility was "successful."LiNeBrEaKDan Genest, a Dominion spokesman, said the power company still had issues with the RGGI effort.LiNeBrEaK"We continue to be concerned that the auctions will increase electric bills," Genest said. "And we continue to maintain that a national greenhouse gas policy is better than a regional one."

Brattleboro Reformer (Vermont)  	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	Welch named to energy committee  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	675 words  	Jan. 7--BRATTLEBORO -- Vermont Rep. Peter Welch has been appointed to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee named Welch, D-Vt., to serve on the committee on Monday. His appointment is contingent on Rep. Hilda Solis, D-Calif., being confirmed as President-elect Barack Obama's choice for Secretary of Labor.LiNeBrEaKWelch received the news just hours before he was sworn into office with the 111st Congress at noon Tuesday. This will be his second term in Washington. LiNeBrEaKWith the new committee appointment, Welch hopes to bring a Vermont "common sense approach" to address health care and energy policy, two of the biggest issues effecting middle class Americans.LiNeBrEaK"It will be a very significant opportunity to represent the interests of the state of Vermont, (and) the people of Vermont," he said in a phone interview on Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKThis state is regarded as a national leader in health care reform and with renewable energy, especially with Vermont's clean energy fund, he added.LiNeBrEaK"These are two steps Vermont has taken that I'd like to see included in any national legislation ... We should have a clean energy fund here in Washington that will be good for the economy and create new jobs," said Welch. "This is a tremendous opportunity for Vermonters to have a seat at the table as Congress tackles our nation's most pressing priorities."LiNeBrEaKThe Energy and CommerceLiNeBrEaKcommittee has jurisdiction over five Cabinet-level departments and seven independent agencies, as well as legislative authority over energy policy, health care, telecommunications, trade and the environment.LiNeBrEaK"We must reform our health care system, craft a 21st century energy policy and create new, green jobs. On the Energy and Commerce committee we will be able to directly address these and other issues Vermonters care about most and get this country back on track," Welch said.LiNeBrEaKOrganizations within the Green Mountain State have already applauded the appointment, noticing the decision will be in the best interest for Vermonters. The committee will address key energy and global warming legislation in Congress for the upcoming session, issues that are top priorities for Vermont residents.LiNeBrEaK"With representation on both the House and Senate Energy committees, -- Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is on the Senate committee -- it's even more important that Vermont provide leadership in the green energy economy," said Paul Burns, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, in a news release Tuesday.LiNeBrEaK"Our state should be an incubator of good ideas that Rep. Welch and Sen. Sanders can take with them to Washington," said Burns. "(Welch's) appointment means that he is not only highly regarded by the House leadership but is now a major player on one of the most important issues facing Vermont and the nation."LiNeBrEaKWelch will join California Democrat Henry Waxman as new members on the committee. Waxman formerly served as chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and is expected to lead the Energy and Commerce committee as well.LiNeBrEaK"I am delighted that Peter Welch is joining the Energy and Commerce Committee. Over the last two years, I have worked with him closely on the oversight committee and have been extremely impressed by his leadership," said Waxman in a news release Tuesday. "His exceptional ability and experience will make an important difference as we moved forward in the new Congress."LiNeBrEaKDuring his first term in the House, Welch served on the Rules Committee and the oversight committee with Waxman.

Detroit Free Press (Michigan)  	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	Bush to leave fuel economy rules decision for Obama  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	668 words  	WASHINGTON _ The Bush administration declined Wednesday to put into place tough new fuel economy rules for cars and trucks, letting the incoming Obama administration decide how to balance cutting Americans' demand for oil with billions of dollars in new costs for struggling Detroit automakers.LiNeBrEaKIn a statement, the U.S. Department of Transportation said the industry's financial decline will require the Obama administration to conduct a "thorough review" of the fuel economy rules, and that the work already done should allow the next administration to finish ahead of an April 1 deadline set by the 2007 energy bill. LiNeBrEaKThe delay, widely expected by the industry, adds yet another variable to an uncertain outlook for 2009.LiNeBrEaK"Manufacturers need certainty and this decision only further delays their ability to finalize future product plans," said Charles Territo, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. "We look forward to working with the Obama administration to provide them with any information they need to complete this rulemaking."LiNeBrEaKWhile President George W. Bush ordered the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to finish the fuel economy rules for the 2011 through 2015 model years by the end of 2008, the final rule has been stuck in limbo since November when regulators signed off on it. People familiar with the new rule says it makes several changes to what the government had originally proposed, setting an average of 31. 8 miles per gallon for new vehicles by 2015, 0. 2 mpg higher than the draft version.LiNeBrEaKBut the original rule was expected to cost the industry $47 billion to meet, with Detroit's three automakers forced to shoulder $31 billion of that cost. Automakers had sought several changes to the proposal, while environmental groups had said it should be stronger in the wake of $4-a-gallon gasoline last summer.LiNeBrEaKThose changes, along with the automakers' own move toward more efficient models, actually reduced the cost of the final rule to $36 billion industry-wide. Costs are not broken down by company.LiNeBrEaKJust as the rule was finished in November, Detroit automakers came to Washington seeking $34 billion in aid to survive one of the worst economic downturns in the industry's history. None expect auto sales to rebound this year from the 15-year lows hit in 2008.LiNeBrEaKObama and several of his Cabinet picks back forcing the industry to comply with California's state laws limiting global warming pollution from vehicles, which automakers contend will act like state-by-state fuel economy rules. The proposed Bush administration rule claimed the federal standards overrode California law, a contention that several states and environmental groups have vowed to challenge in court.LiNeBrEaKWithout the rule, automakers will have to wait a number of months for the new administration to pick staffers and rework the standards. Given that the designs and fuel efficiency of most 2011 models have been frozen by now, any new rule will likely have to start with 2012, although the new administration could stretch out the years covered.LiNeBrEaKDan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, said the Obama administration should set standards of at least 35 mpg by 2015 and 42. 5 mpg by 2020.LiNeBrEaKWhile the Bush rule was "far from perfect, it was a step forward and failure to issue it may delay the arrival of cleaner cars."LiNeBrEaKU.S. Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said he too wished the Bush administration had acted, given the serious problems facing the country.LiNeBrEaK"This may compel the new administration to do this with great haste, as opposed to great haste and great care, because both have to be done," he said.LiNeBrEaKVisit the Freep, the World Wide Web site of the Detroit Free Press, at http://www.freep.com.

People familiar with the new rule says it makes several changes to what the government had originally proposed, setting a target of 31. 8 m.p.g. by 2015, 0. 2 m.p.g. higher than the draft version.LiNeBrEaKBut the original rule was expected to cost the industry $47 billion to meet, with Detroit's three automakers forced to shoulder $31 billion of that cost. Automakers had sought several changes to the proposal.LiNeBrEaKJust as the rule was finished, Detroit automakers came to Washington seeking $34 billion in aid to survive one of the worst economic downturns in the industry's history. None expects auto sales to rebound this year from the lows hit in 2008.LiNeBrEaKObama and several members of his prospective cabinet support forcing the industry to comply with California's state laws limiting global warming pollution from vehicles, which automakers contend will act like state-by-state fuel economy rules. The proposed Bush administration rule said the federal standards overrode California law, a contention that several states and environmental groups have vowed to challenge in court.LiNeBrEaKWithout the rule, automakers will have to wait a number of months for the new administration to pick staffers and rework the standards. Given that the designs and efficiency of most 2011 models have been frozen by now, any new rule will likely have to start with 2012, although the new administration could stretch out the years covered.

Detroit Free Press (Michigan)  	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	Environmental activists turn up heat on Granholm: Green-energy fans want coal-fired plants blocked  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	369 words  	Jan. 7--LANSING -- A coalition of environmental activists used a public hearing Tuesday on a proposed coal-fired power plant in Rogers City to renew their call for Gov. Jennifer Granholm to block construction of all such plants and hasten Michigan's transition to so-called green energy. LiNeBrEaKThe 600-megawatt plant, to be built by the Wolverine Power Supply Cooperative, is one of several proposals for new coal-fired generators to meet future energy demands and replace older power plants.LiNeBrEaKSome of the permit decisions by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality are expected to come in the next few months.LiNeBrEaKThe environmentalists urged Granholm to reject coal in favor of alternative energy, with an emphasis on wind and solar power, as a way to protect public health, stem global warming and create green energy jobs.LiNeBrEaK"This is her opportunity to slam the brakes on Michigan's one-of-a-kind coal rush," said the Sierra Club's Anne Woiwode.LiNeBrEaKGranholm has said that emissions from coal-fired plants "are a growing concern," and financial institutions are increasingly reluctant to invest in carbon-based utilities. But her spokeswoman, Liz Boyd, said Tuesday that the administration doesn't rule out the possibility of permit approval for one or more of the pending coal-fired proposals.LiNeBrEaKJeff Holyfield, spokesman for Consumers Energy, which has applied for approval of an 800-megawatt plant in Bay City, said the new plants are needed.LiNeBrEaKConsumers supplies 58% of customers' energy needs with coal now, he said, and a transition to alternative sources would take several decades. Alternative-energy technology is improving, Holyfield said, but green energy remains more expensive to produce and less reliable than energy produced from traditional sources.LiNeBrEaKContact DAWSON BELL at 517-372-8661 or dbell@freepress.com	ENVIRONMENTALISM (94%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (94%); POWER PLANTS (92%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (92%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (91%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (91%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); ENERGY DEMAND (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); APPROVALS (78%); WIND ENERGY (78%); PUBLIC HEARINGS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (78%); SOLAR ENERGY (73%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (68%); BANKING and FINANCE (66%); PLANT CONSTRUCTION (58%)  	JENNIFER GRANHOLM (94%)  	LANSING, MI, USA (91%) MICHIGAN, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 7, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Detroit Free Press   	Dawson Bell, Detroit Free Press  	SIERRA CLUB (55%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	NAICS322121 PAPER (EXCEPT NEWSPRINT) MILLS (55%); SIC2621 PAPER MILLS (55%) Construction  	20090107-DE-Environmental-activists-turn-up-heat-on-Granholm-0107  	DE  	002235 (SZSE) (55%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (63%); WOLVERINE POWER SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC (57%); XIAMEN ANNE CORP LTD (55%)  												
The Gazette (Cedar Rapids, Iowa)  	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	Controversial Waterloo power plant canceled  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	408 words  	Jan. 7--LS Power has pulled the plug on plans to build a $1. 3 billion coal-fired generating station in Waterloo.LiNeBrEaKThe company blamed "slowing load growth in the region due to the current downturn in the U.S. economy, and the fact that LS Power has more advanced projects under development in the region that could serve the same need." The project was opposed by county boards of health and environmental groups concerned mainly about the plant's impact on regional air quality and the effect its carbon dioxide emissions could have on climate change. Those environmental issues probably played a large part in LS Power's plans to cancel the project, said attorney Wally Taylor of Cedar Rapids, legal chair of the Sierra Club's Iowa chapter. LiNeBrEaK"It's great news, and it foreshadows the economic problems that coal-burning plants are going to have," Taylor said.LiNeBrEaKTaylor said the plant faced a growing possibility of restrictions on its fine particulate emissions -- restrictions that the company had hoped to avoid. He said the possibility that the plant could face carbon taxes or be placed under a cap-and-trade system of regulating greenhouse gas emissions also will increase under the new federal administration taking office next month.LiNeBrEaKLS Power's Elk Run Energy Station differed from most other power plants operating in Iowa in that it would not generate power for use by its owners. Rather, LS Power planned to sell its output to utilities or other major users.LiNeBrEaKThe project cancellation was announced just days af ter Dynegy Inc. announced it would not continue a coalfired power plant development joint venture with LS Power.LiNeBrEaKThe Cedar Rapids-based public interest law center Plains Justice issued a statement congratulating LS Power and Dynegy for recognizing that developing new coal plants is "just too financially risky for their stockholders." Plains Justice said a new Alliant Energy power plant planned for Marshalltown takes the same "imprudent financial risks."LiNeBrEaK-- Contact the writer: (319) 398-8317 or david.dewitte@gazcomm.com	ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (92%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (91%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (90%); POWER PLANTS (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (87%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (78%); COAL INDUSTRY (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (76%); PUBLIC HEALTH and WELFARE LAW (76%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (76%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (75%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (71%); PARTICULATE MATTER (70%); LAWYERS (70%)  		IOWA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 7, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Gazette   	Dave DeWitte, The Gazette, Cedar Rapids, Iowa  	SIERRA CLUB (56%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	NAICS221210 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION (92%); NAICS221122 ELECTRIC POWER DISTRIBUTION (92%); NAICS211112 NATURAL GAS LIQUID EXTRACTION (92%); SIC1321 NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (92%); NAICS221111 HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (52%); SIC4931 ELECTRIC and OTHER SERVICES COMBINED (52%); SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES (92%) General  	20090107-CR-Controversial-Waterloo-power-plant-canceled-0107  	CR  	DYN (NYSE) (92%); LNT (NYSE) (52%) NYSE:DYN, NYSE:LNT  	DYNEGY INC (92%); MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (62%); ALLIANT ENERGY CORP (52%)  												
Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday   ALL S EDITION	Let's use our own oil;  The Public Pulse 	EDITORIAL; Pg. A13  	231 words  	Reading the column by Thomas Friedman ("Will Obama have the guts to raise the gas tax?" Press, Dec. 30) is a reminder of how the global warming/don't drill for oil/we need to change America's taste crowd is again trying to push their agenda. LiNeBrEaKThe only way they can convince people to dislike SUVs, trucks, etc. is by raising the price of gas to levels that makes it difficult for the ordinary guy to afford it. How? By taxing it more. What they fail to realize is that the technologies that they want are not currently cost-effective. Plus, why do they think they can dictate likes and dislikes for American citizens? Do those who buy SUVs do so because they don't like them?LiNeBrEaKAlso, when a family lives from paycheck to paycheck, they can't really afford to "give" more of their hard earned money to the government. It's not a matter of not having enough oil. We have a lot of our own oil which would effectively blunt the need to purchase it from Saudi Arabia or any other oil producing country. I'm certainly not opposed to research into alternate sources of energy, but it should be done in a cost-effective manner. We in fact have a multi-billion dollar Department of Energy that has been there since the Jimmy Carter days.LiNeBrEaKHas it paid for itself while using lots of taxpayer dollars?

Indian Country Today (Oneida, New York)  	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	Groups press for tribe-friendly renewable energy policies  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1099 words  	Jan. 7--WASHINGTON -- As more tribes explore and get involved in the renewable energy field, a network of tribal groups is asking President-elect Barack Obama to support tribally owned and operated renewable energy projects, along with economic development initiatives that could reduce dependence on fossil fuelsLiNeBrEaK"The Obama economic stimulus plan that incorporates a green economy and green jobs portfolio must include provisions for access of these resources by our Native nations, our tribal education and training institutions and Native organizations and communities," according to a policy statement released jointly Dec. 17 by the Intertribal Council on Utility Policy, the Indigenous Environmental Network, the International Indian Treaty Council and the Honor the Earth environmental group. LiNeBrEaK"When considering energy production, resource extraction, housing and energy efficiency, it is essential that the incoming administration takes into account the disproportionate impacts of climate change and energy development on American Indian reservations and Alaska Native villages, and the potential for catalyzing green reservation economies."LiNeBrEaKThe groups represent approximately 250 grassroots tribal organizations and tribes that want to ensure American Indian participation and prosperity in the green economy of the future.LiNeBrEaKThe statement says that federal government subsidies for the nuclear, coal, gas and oil industry should be rapidly phased out with a proportional ramp up of subsidies for renewable technologies and locally administered conservation and efficiency improvements.LiNeBrEaKUnder current federal law, tribes are not directly entitled to credits provided to non-Native developers for renewable energy production. This has created a system where outside companies sometimes think twice about teaming with tribes on renewable energy projects, since, if they do so, the federal government does not allow for a full tax credit.LiNeBrEaK"Projects involving technologies like wind power could stand on their own if none of the energy sectors got [federal] subsidies or incentives, but there are already billions of dollars built into coal, gas and coal subsidies," said Bob Gough, a leader with Intertribal COUP.LiNeBrEaK"To compete against them, renewable energy technologies require subsidies as well. You can't artificially keep the price of energy down, and then expect new kinds of technology to bear all the costs."LiNeBrEaKThe groups are pressing for changes to subsidy laws to make them more tribe-friendly, and also say that any climate change legislation should not allocate funds for nuclear or clean coal technologies, as they believe those practices are often harmful to the Earth and to tribal interests.LiNeBrEaKThe policy paper specifically asks that policymakers provide a renewable production refund for tribal projects that can't utilize current tax credits, as well as offer financial matching grants to capitalize renewable energy potential in tribal communities.LiNeBrEaKThe organizations believe that a new crop of tribal renewable projects, which would be assisted by the legislative changes they seek, would provide dual benefits of low carbon power and green economic development where it is needed most.LiNeBrEaKSupport for legislative action involving tribes and energy is based on the following research gathered by the groups:LiNeBrEaK-- Tribal lands have an estimated 535 billion kWh/year of wind power generation potential.LiNeBrEaK-- Tribal lands have an estimated 17,000 billion kWh/year of solar electricity generation potential, about 4. 5 times the total U.S. annual generation.LiNeBrEaK-- Investing in renewable energy creates more jobs per dollar invested than fossil fuel energy.LiNeBrEaK-- Efficiency creates 21. 5 jobs for every $1 million invested.LiNeBrEaK-- The costs of fuel for wind and solar power can be projected into the future, providing a unique opportunity for stabilizing an energy intensive economy.LiNeBrEaKIn sum, members of the tribal network believe that forward thinking energy and climate policy will have the ability to transform tribal and other rural economies, while also providing a basis for an overall economic recovery in the U.S.LiNeBrEaKGough estimated that close to 100 tribes across the country have already assessed or are currently assessing the wind and/or solar energy resources that are available on their lands. Some of the tribes, including those in the Plains and Southwest regions, have found that their renewable energy resources rank among the most abundant in the U.S.LiNeBrEaKTony Skrelunas, an America Indian program director with the Grand Canyon Trust environmental group, said that it will be important in 2009 for tribes to continue banding together to make their energy interests well-known to federal policymakers.LiNeBrEaKSkrelunas, a member of the Navajo Nation who used to manage the tribe's economic development operations, said many tribes are now savvy on energy issues, and have evolved to the point where they want strong federal policies put in place to help them harness their power. His group plans to help convene several tribal renewable energy players early in 2009 to focus on national strategies.LiNeBrEaK"There are a lot of issues that have to be worked out and laws that need to be clarified," Skrelunas said. "And the tribes have to be the ones championing this. The tribes have to be the ones going to Congress saying they want these laws changed."LiNeBrEaKSkrelunas said he is looking forward to what the Obama administration brings forward regarding tribal energy issues.LiNeBrEaKIn terms of tribal economics, many energy experts say that renewable projects could create a more stable business model than, say, the development of casinos alone.LiNeBrEaK"One of the issues facing economic development with casinos is that you need to have a number of customers -- you need to have a large population market to draw on, but that's not always the case for remote reservations" Gough noted.LiNeBrEaK"Whereas, it doesn't matter how many people want to use the electricity you're able to produce from a wind turbine in a rural area, you can serve thousands and thousands and thousands of customers from across a whole region."LiNeBrEaKGough said he hopes to see dozens more tribal renewable energy projects up and running by the end of 2009.

The New York Times 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday   Late Edition - Final	An Oil Sandstorm  	Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1  	1346 words  	The oil that is extracted from Canadian dirt is being portrayed as saving America from energy dependence on the unstable Middle East, or an environmental catastrophe in the making  --  depending on the perspective.LiNeBrEaK  As Barack Obama prepares to take office in two weeks, the debate is no longer academic. The president-elect has promised to move forward with an ambitious program aimed at fighting climate change.LiNeBrEaK  Not all oil is alike when it comes to environmental impact, and many environmentalists single out production from the oil sands as the epitome of ''dirty oil.'' In a recent study, the RAND Corporation estimated that oil from the oil sands generates about 10 to 30 percent more greenhouse gases than conventional crude.LiNeBrEaK  Canada, in large part because of the production capacity of its oil sands, is now the largest oil supplier to the United States. But environmental groups in both countries are pushing for a slowdown or even a halt to further oil sands development, which is concentrated in northern Alberta. LiNeBrEaK  Operators of oil sands projects and Canadian governments are eager to point to its potential to reduce America's dependence on oil from politically unstable regions. Canadian oil sands  produce about 1. 2 million barrels a day, or about 9 percent  of the imported oil consumed in the United States. LiNeBrEaK  Production was headed toward 3. 5 million barrels a day by 2015 before the  economic slowdown; with the vast reserves available, Canadian oil sands have the potential to produce the equivalent of 1. 7 trillion barrels of oil.LiNeBrEaK  The oil sands companies, however, have been scaling back as falling oil prices and the general market turmoil create a significant economic challenge for the projects. The entire process adds up to the world's most capital-intensive method for extracting oil. A tiny example: each of the tires on the cartoonishly oversize dump trucks used in oil sands mining costs about $60,000.LiNeBrEaK  While no one is about to park their giant dump trucks, several companies have recently announced delays in future oil sands investments. In November, a consortium led by Petro-Canada said it would temporarily stop 23. 8 billion Canadian dollars ($19. 5 billion) worth of expansions to its oil sands operations in Alberta. LiNeBrEaK  ''We're not in megaproject mode anymore,'' Steve W. Laut, the president and chief executive of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., said to analysts after cutting his company's capital spending plans in half.LiNeBrEaK  And as Washington prepares to deal with climate change, environmentalists, who generally prefer to use the deposits' traditional name of tar sands, are already pressing for restrictions on the projects.LiNeBrEaK  ''It's one of the most destructive projects on earth,'' said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. ''It would be strongly resisted in the United States to exempt the tar sands from any climate agreement.''LiNeBrEaK  Transforming the tar, more properly known as bitumen, which is mixed with sand, into petroleum is energy intensive and creates significant carbon emissions. Steam created by burning natural gas  separates the semisolid bitumen. Then, more natural gas is needed to turn the bitumen into synthetic crude, which can be processed by refineries.LiNeBrEaK  The development of oil sands projects has created North America's greatest boomtown in recent years, Fort McMurray, Alberta. Its outsize  economic importance has prompted Canada's Conservative government, led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, to champion the industry. LiNeBrEaK  After the November election in the United States, Mr. Harper said he would seek to devise a continental climate change pact with the Obama administration. Mr. Harper suggested that any such agreement would include an apparent escape hatch for the oil sands because, he argued, of the energy security benefits they offer the United States. LiNeBrEaK  Since then, however, Mr. Harper avoided an early defeat of his government, which does not control a majority of seats in the House of Commons, by shutting Parliament. Even if the Obama administration is willing to hold talks with Canada, Mr. Harper's grip on power is now uncertain.LiNeBrEaK  Recent environmental assessments, including the RAND study, also do not further the cause of the oil sands industry. While climate change is the current focus, it is not the only environmental issue surrounding the projects. LiNeBrEaK  Spent water used in oil sands projects is placed in lake-size tailings ponds, one of which killed about 500 migrating birds in April. Seepage from the ponds is polluting rivers in northern Canada, some scientists argue. In December, Environmental Defence, an environmental lobby group based in Toronto, estimated that about four billion liters of contaminated water leaked from the ponds each year. (The Alberta government and the oil industry dispute that finding.)LiNeBrEaK  Strip mining of the oil sands, the most common method of extraction, has destroyed large swaths of boreal forest, an important habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife. In December, a study published by the Natural Resources Defense Council and two other groups found that six million to 166 million birds could be lost over the next 30 to 50 years because of that disruption.LiNeBrEaK  Producers say they are making efforts to address environmental concerns. Mr. Laut's company, which recently completed a 110,000-barrel-a-day oil sands project, is developing systems to capture and store much of the carbon dioxide it emits.  It has applied for government grants to test a system that will trap some of its carbon dioxide output by bubbling the exhaust gases from an upgrading plant through the spent water from a strip mine's steam.LiNeBrEaK  Large-scale programs to capture and store carbon dioxide are not yet in place. The demonstration project of Canadian Natural Resources, for example, is not scheduled to begin until 2010.LiNeBrEaK  With oil prices around $49 a barrel, profitability is fast eroding at oil sands projects and may already be vanishing at some operations. Producers have widely differing cost structures and varying definitions of profitability. But Andrew J. Leach, a professor of environmental economics at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, estimates that long-established plants can operate with prices as low as $30 a barrel. But he said  newer operations need $60 to $70 a barrel for acceptable returns, and no one will proceed with proposed projects until prices return to the $80 to $90 range. LiNeBrEaK  Exactly how Canada could participate in the shaping of an American strategy for climate change is unclear.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Harper, who is from Alberta, initially dismissed concerns about climate change. After taking power in 2006, he abandoned commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions made by the previous Liberal government when it signed the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.LiNeBrEaK  Instead, Mr. Harper's government has promised a 20 percent reduction in Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. What is more significant, however, is that the proposal wants to use as a baseline 2006 -- a year with more pollution -- rather than the Kyoto standard of 1990.LiNeBrEaK  In addition, the new plan  requires companies, including oil sands operators, only to reduce the rate at which they emit greenhouse gases. If they achieve those efficiencies, they will still be allowed to raise their total emissions through increased production.LiNeBrEaK  Even if Canadian producers dislike American climate change policies, they will be hard-pressed to sell their oil elsewhere. Canada's pipeline network takes oil sands production south and offers no routes to ports for export to other countries.LiNeBrEaK  But some people are optimistic about the prospect of a two-nation climate pact. LiNeBrEaK  ''It would be a big mistake for Congress to impose restrictions on the oil sands,'' said Paul Cellucci, a former governor of Massachusetts and former United States ambassador to Canada who now works on energy issues for the law firm McCarter and English, in Boston. ''That would not be good for the United States.''

The New York Times 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday   Late Edition - Final	E.P.A. and Clean Air  	Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; LETTER; Pg. 26  	181 words  	To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Here's why your Dec. 25 editorial ''E.P.A.'s Doctor No'' misses the mark. LiNeBrEaK  In 2002, President Bush asked Congress to give the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to develop a market-based strategy for controlling interstate pollution. Congress failed to act, and the E.P.A. developed the Clean Air Interstate Rule using existing authorities. The Court of Appeals has now said the E.P.A. acted beyond its authority. Action by Congress would have avoided this uncertainty.LiNeBrEaK  With respect to energy security and climate change, in 2007, as the president requested, Congress enacted legislation to increase renewable fuels production and improve fuel economy. The Department of Transportation and the E.P.A. are working to carry out these programs.LiNeBrEaK  More needs to be done on other sources of greenhouse gas emissions, but existing Clean Air Act authorities could well be cumbersome and ill suited. Congress should act to avoid years of litigation and regulatory uncertainty.LiNeBrEaK  Stephen L.

The New York Times 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday   Late Edition - Final	Mr. Bush's Monument  	Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 26  	642 words  	Try this on a globe sometime, or Google Earth: Looking head-on at the planet, spin it until Hawaii is a little north and east of center. What you'll see -- besides the barest fringes of America and Asia up there, New Guinea and New Zealand down there, and lots of island dots -- is all blue. LiNeBrEaK  This is the vast stage on which President Bush is trying to salvage his environmental legacy. LiNeBrEaK  It's strange but true. Mr. Bush, who has been monumentally indifferent to the health of continents and the atmosphere, is going down in history as a protector of the oceans. LiNeBrEaK  On Tuesday, he designated three huge areas of the western Pacific as national monuments, declaring that their fish, birds, reefs and other marine life were more important than commercial fishing, drilling and mineral extraction. The protected waters encircle the Northern Mariana Islands (including the Mariana Trench, the deepest canyon on Earth) and parts of a sprawling collection of reefs and atolls known as the Line Islands. LiNeBrEaK  They are a dazzling world of undersea volcanoes, pristine reefs, endangered seals, turtles and whales and intact food chains ruled by sharks.LiNeBrEaK  In protecting nearly 200,000 square miles of ocean, an area far bigger than California, Mr. Bush has outdone his decision in 2006 to set aside 140,000 square miles in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands. LiNeBrEaK  That created a single monument larger than all the country's national parks combined. If you judge the actions of presidential conservationists solely by the sheer size of planetary surface they protected during their time in office, Mr. Bush would outdo even Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt.LiNeBrEaK  This record, though, has enormous asterisks:LiNeBrEaK  *The new monuments are not nearly as big as they could have been. Mr. Bush could have set their boundaries anywhere from 3 miles from the shores of the territories they encircle to the full 200 miles under United States jurisdiction. He chose 50 miles, excluding huge expanses of deep ocean.LiNeBrEaK  *The protections could have been more stringent. They don't rule out recreational fishing, for example, and do not include waters above the Mariana Trench. LiNeBrEaK  *Big as they are, the monuments are not nearly enough to offset eight years of Mr. Bush's bad environmental policies, marked by inaction on climate change, the sacrifice of millions of acres of public lands to oil and gas exploration, and indifference bordering on hostility to endangered species and fragile ecosystems.LiNeBrEaK  Given that record, why did he create these new ocean monuments over the reported objections of Vice President Dick Cheney and the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, a notorious enabler of reckless overfishing by commercial fleets? LiNeBrEaK  We can take him at his word that it was the right thing to do, but we have to note as well that the areas protected are staggeringly far away and not notably prized by the corporate interests whose priorities the Bush administration has for so long made its own. LiNeBrEaK  There was no fight involved. All it took was Mr. Bush's signature under the Antiquities Act of 1906, which allows presidents to protect public lands by executive order. An environmental trophy was lying on the ground, and Mr. Bush, with just days left in his presidency, simply picked it up.LiNeBrEaK  It will be up to President-elect Barack Obama to take it from here. He should expand the monuments to the 200-mile limit and give them full protection against fishing and other exploitation. His administration should also work to create and expand marine protected areas closer to our shores. LiNeBrEaK  But those are just the easy lifts in a huge list of environmental tasks ahead, starting with the long-neglected fight against global warming. Melting ice caps and ocean acidification are an urgent threat to the very fish, reefs and islands that Mr. Bush lately has seen fit to protect.

The News and Advance (Lynchburg, Virginia)  	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	Butterfly expert's work part of new kid's book on climate change  	LIFESTYLE  	514 words  	Jan. 7--Climate change is a tough topic for adults to fathom, much less kids. To help explain it, a recently released children's and teens' book explores the subject through vignettes, which include the work of a Sweet Briar College research biologist who is an expert on monarch butterflies. LiNeBrEaKThe work of Lincoln Brower is featured in "How We Know What We Know about Our Changing Climate: Scientists and Kids Explore Global Warming." It's by Lynne Cherry and Gary Braasch, who compiled a wide range of scientific study relating to the environment.LiNeBrEaK"It is very comprehensive on many of the problems associated with global warming," Brower said of the 67-page book. "The photos are elegantly done, and it should appeal to children, as is the authors' (and) publisher's intent."LiNeBrEaKAccording to an author's news release, "The book depicts scientists at work; teaches children the language, methods and process of science; imparts knowledge of technological tools and data collection; provides methods and ideas for school and home projects about weather and climate; describes and encourages participation in citizen-science programs; shows how each child can immediately reduce their carbon footprint and inspires them to do so by showing the effects of many kids working together already influencing communities to change."LiNeBrEaKBrower -- who taught biology at Amherst College for 22 years and is distinguished service professor of zoology emeritus, University of Florida -- has researched overwintering, migration and conservation biology of monarchs for more than 50 years. He is an ardent defender of the monarch butterfly and its habitats.LiNeBrEaKHis work studying the microclimate of the monarchs' overwintering grounds in the mountains of central Mexico is described on pages 18 and 19.LiNeBrEaKAs in other sections of the book, the chapter includes information on "citizen scientists," who contribute to the understanding of science through participation in efforts such as the Monarch Larval Monitoring Program and Monarch Watch. Brower is especially enthusiastic about another project, Journey North, http://www.learner.org/jnorth, a Web site he considers to be a "wonderful educational" resource.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the news release, the citizen-science projects described in the book allow student readers to see how they can contribute to understanding global warming and, "by seeing how scientific information leads to informed decision-making, students will understand the excitement, utility and practical applications of careers in science."LiNeBrEaKfyiLiNeBrEaKPREVIEW: Visit http://www.howweLiNeBrEaKknowclimatechange.comLiNeBrEaKINFO: Contact Ronit Dancis, ; Sweet Briar's college relations office, or (434) 381-6262	CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); CHILDREN (90%); CHILDREN'S LITERATURE (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (78%); BOOK REVIEWS (78%); RESEARCH (77%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (77%); TEACHING and TEACHERS (73%); MOUNTAINS (70%)  		VIRGINIA, USA (90%); FLORIDA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (90%); MEXICO (77%)  	January 7, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The News and Advance   	The News and Advance, Lynchburg, Va.

The News and Advance (Lynchburg, Virginia)  	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	2008 another dry year for Lynchburg  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	603 words  	Jan. 7--While it might be raining right now, 2008 ended in Lynchburg as the 15th-driest year since record keeping began in 1892. The 31. 6 inches of precipitation that fell follows a 6. 5-inch deficit in 2007.LiNeBrEaKRainfall throughout much of the region was below normal in 2008, with Danville receiving 2. 5 inches less than average and Roanoke 9. 8 inches below normal, said Phil Hysell, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Blacksburg. LiNeBrEaKBased on decades of state records, a drought occurs on average twice per 10-year period, said Scott Kudlas, director of the Department of Environmental Quality's office of water supply.LiNeBrEaK"But since 1990, that's changed. In fact, over the course of the last 10 years, it's been exactly the opposite," he said. "We've had two above-normal years and eight drought years."LiNeBrEaKAdding the year-end rainfall deficits together over the past decade yields a total deficit of 31. 68 -- more than the total rainfall measured in Lynchburg is 2008. The vast majority of that deficit, 28. 25 inches, came in the last five years.LiNeBrEaK"Nobody knows for sure, but clearly there's been some speculation that it may be something related to climate change," Kudlas said. "But there would need to be further research to determine whether that's the case."LiNeBrEaKKudlas, who compiles monthly drought monitoring reports for the DEQ, said forecasts call for the next three months to be warmer and dryer than average, which could further impact already low groundwater levels.LiNeBrEaKGroundwater, in particular, has been seriously impacted by the ongoing drought. Only about one inch of rain per 10 inches trickles into the cracks that make up the aquifer, Kudlas said.LiNeBrEaKStreams, rivers and lakes get a significant amount of water from the ground and unless rain falls during the critical time of year for recharging the groundwater, that level can further drop even if there is rain. That recharge time is from about Thanksgiving to early March, Kudlas said, because most plant life is dormant and therefore not using as much water, and temperatures are low, slowing evaporation.LiNeBrEaKDuring the height of the summer heat, streams throughout the region all but dried up. In some cases -- portions of Ivy Creek, Pedlar River and the Buffalo River, for example -- the streambeds had no water in them for at least several weeks. Wells throughout the area struggled, with some running dry.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, stream and reservoir levels were low and it took until mid-March of 2008 for Lynchburg's primary water source, Pedlar Reservoir, to reach full pond. The reservoir dropped below the spillway in early June, more than a month earlier than usual. Smith Mountain Lake, which had been almost five feet below full pond, still is about 2 1/2  feet below full pond.LiNeBrEaKDespite the dry year, the deficit would have been worse had November and December not been wetter than average. Since November, 7. 42 inches of rain have fallen, almost an inch above average for that time of year.LiNeBrEaKWhile there was significant crop damage in 2008, it wasn't as bad as 2007 because just enough rain fell during crucial growing periods to help plants take root, Kudlas said. "Once they get growing they're better able to survive drought conditions."

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday   Sunrise Edition	Oregon picks climate center chief  	Local News; Pg. D02  	517 words  	SUMMARY: Research   | Philip W. Mote, an expert on Northwest patterns, will lead the new instituteLiNeBrEaKOregon names director for climate change center Oregon picks climate center chiefLiNeBrEaKMICHAEL MILSTEIN LiNeBrEaKA widely known Washington climate scientist who has contributed to definitive international reports on global warming will head a new Oregon research institute focused on climate change, state officials announced Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKPhilip W. Mote, Washington's state climatologist, will lead the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute, which was created by the Legislature. The institute is based at Oregon State University but is a shared effort by Oregon's statewide university system.LiNeBrEaKMote also will become a professor in OSU's College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences. He will start work part time this spring and move to full time in the summer.LiNeBrEaKMote said Tuesday that he sensed strong enthusiasm for him and for the institute among researchers at OSU, Portland State University and the University of Oregon. He said that was one big reason he took the job.LiNeBrEaK"It's rare in a university setting to see people so charged up about a common enterprise," he said. "It was really about the level of enthusiasm of the researchers at the various universities."LiNeBrEaKMote, based at the University of Washington's Climate Impacts Group, has led research on climate changes in the Pacific Northwest in recent decades, including trends in precipitation and temperatures. He was a lead author of a major report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which received a Nobel Prize for the work.LiNeBrEaK"He just has such an understanding of climate issues in the Northwest," said Mark Abbott, dean of the College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences at OSU. "He has spent years understanding the needs of local and state governments. He can really hit the ground running."LiNeBrEaKThe climate institute will support Oregon's new Global Warming Commission, created by Gov. Ted Kulongoski. "The institute will be critical to advancing Oregon's position as a leader in climate change research and policy development," the governor said in a news release.LiNeBrEaKMote differs on climate change with George Taylor, former head of the Oregon Climate Service and widely known for questioning the causes of climate change. The two faced off in a 2007 debate at OMSI.LiNeBrEaKMote said one of his goals in Oregon will be to encourage interdisciplinary research into the implications of climate change that bridges different fields, from physical sciences to social sciences. He said Oregon is unique in creating a research center dedicated to expanding knowledge and informing the public, governments and businesses about the implications of climate change.LiNeBrEaKAbbott said Mote's background in collaborative research will help make the new center a crucial asset in Oregon. Broader scientific understanding of climate change will lead to better policy and will help the state make wise future investments, he said.LiNeBrEaKMote was among four candidates interviewed.LiNeBrEaKprofessor at OSULiNeBrEaKMichael Milstein: 503-294-7689;LiNeBrEaKmichaelmilstein@LiNeBrEaKnews.oregonian.com	CLIMATOLOGY (92%); CLIMATE CHANGE (91%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (90%); COLLEGES and UNIVERSITIES (90%); APPOINTMENTS (90%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (90%); WEATHER (89%); METEOROLOGY (89%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (89%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); TRENDS (78%); SCIENCE NEWS (78%); EXECUTIVE MOVES (78%); LEGISLATORS (76%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (76%); PUBLIC POLICY (76%); GOVERNORS (76%); HUMANITIES and SOCIAL SCIENCE (73%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (72%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (71%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (70%); AWARDS and PRIZES (64%); NOBEL PRIZES (50%)  	TED KULONGOSKI (53%)  	PORTLAND, OR, USA (58%) OREGON, USA (95%); NORTHWEST USA (79%); WEST USA (79%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	January 8, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  	MICHAEL MILSTEIN, The Oregonian  	OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY (83%); UNIVERSITY OF OREGON (56%); UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON (55%); INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (54%)  																Mote Scientist will be				
The Paducah Sun (Kentucky)  	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	OPINION: Wrong Turn: Hiking fuel tax amid recession bad policy  	COMMENTARY  	735 words  	Jan. 7--American motorists are driving less. And therefore must be punished.LiNeBrEaKHuh?LiNeBrEaKWait a minute; we thought driving less was a good thing. It reduces carbon emissions, right? The experts are still for cutting carbon emissions, aren't they? Global warming and all that.LiNeBrEaKYes, of course. Sort of. Unfortunately, less driving also means less gas consumption, which reduces gas tax revenue. Less gas tax revenue means less money for roads, bridges and transit projects. LiNeBrEaKThe solution, according to Washington experts, is to raise the gas tax. The federal government believes it is duty-bound to extract the same amount of taxes from the consumer, regardless of the consumer's consumption. You spend less, the feds tax more.LiNeBrEaKA congressionally appointed commission with a snore-inducing, mischief-masking title -- the National Commission on Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing -- has just issued a recommendation to raise the gasoline tax from 18. 4 cents a gallon to 28. 4 cents a gallon (a 54-percent increase), and the diesel fuel tax from 24. 4 cents a gallon to 39. 4 cents a gallon (up 61 percent).LiNeBrEaKBut aren't the soaring gas prices throughout most of 2008 the reason Americans are curtailing their driving? And wouldn't raising the tax, just as pump prices start to edge back up, only further reduce consumption?LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, Washington seldom considers any of the ramifications of a tax increase except the anticipated revenue, which is unfailingly based on current market factors. Lawmakers never seem to grasp, for example, how tax cuts have historically produced increased tax revenues.LiNeBrEaKSo the commission with the ridiculously long name, ignoring the reason why fuel tax revenue has fallen, wants to squeeze more money from the consumers using a method guaranteed to further reduce consumption.LiNeBrEaKThe commission is not alone in its folly. The ironically named Reason Foundation also favors a gas tax increase to keep infrastructure maintenance on schedule. The foundation, purportedly a libertarian think tank devoted to free markets, has clearly not applied much reason to this issue.LiNeBrEaKIf Americans are driving less, the infrastructure is enduring less wear and tear. Theoretically, that should mean the timetable for road and bridge projects could be stretched a bit.LiNeBrEaKJust because a family is forced to skip a summer vacation this year doesn't mean the family will never vacation again. And the highway resurfacing project that would have delayed their arrival in Orlando in 2008 may still be able to delay it in 2009. Projects can be postponed.LiNeBrEaKTax hikes are almost always a bad idea, but never more than during a recession. Nothing stifles the economic activity necessary for a recovery like higher taxes.LiNeBrEaKAnd the gas tax is among the most regressive of taxes, hurting the poor disproportionately. One could argue that it is the fairest tax since it is tied directly to consumption. But if driving is your livelihood, higher fuel taxes take bread off the table.LiNeBrEaKIf the long-name commission's recommended tax hike seems modest, consider this: the commission revealed its long-term plan at the beginning of 2008 when it recommended a 40-cent increase, implemented incrementally over five years. That would more than triple the current tax.LiNeBrEaKAnd that's not all. After five years, the commission says, the tax should be indexed to inflation. Indexing would ensure the tax continues to rise. Now that's a bad idea on steroids.LiNeBrEaKThe commission justifies its plan in part with this: "(A) cultural shift will need to take place across America to encourage our citizens to take transit or passenger rail when the option is given."LiNeBrEaKIn other words, Washington wants to control your transportation decisions. Specifically, it wants you out of your car. Just not yet. Not until you've forked over a few million in gas taxes for road repairs.LiNeBrEaKConfused? Perhaps this will clear it up. The federal government will punish you for driving too little. And then punish you for driving too much. Either way, you're going to pay more.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	Obama s choice of scientists shows respect for science  	COMMENTARY; Pg. 7  	607 words  	FALMOUTHLiNeBrEaKPRESIDENT-ELECT Obama s recent choosing of three scientists to work in the upper levels of his administration brought mostly accolades and a bit of grousing from a vocal minority. Some pundits and bloggers have reacted with disdain, in part, because the appointees all believe that man-made climate change is real (and a problem) and have expressed their opinions about this and other issues. Others worry about how scientists trained in one narrow field could handle the spectrum of scientific problems that they may confront. LiNeBrEaKHere is the deal about scientists, especially really talented ones. They have egos, big egos. They are competitive, and they worry about their legacies. And their greatest fear is being wrong. I have seen scientists take extraordinary efforts to prove a colleague wrong (and, of course, relish the fight). And I have watched the attacked person take equally extraordinary efforts to prove not only his or her rightness but the wrongness of the attacker. Some of these scientific debates are intellectual street fights. The result is that questions are asked, gaps get filled, inconsistencies are hammered out, discoveries are made, problems get solved, and science incrementally moves forward. Science s regulatory systems work more often than not. And unlike the world of Bernie Madoff, modern science hasn t produced a Ponzi scheme decades long.LiNeBrEaKSenator Obama s selections are some of our country s finest scientists. They have received numerous awards and honors, including a Nobel Prize for Dr. Steven Chu, slated to run the Department of Energy. Professors John Holdren and Jane Lubchecno are scheduled to act as the White House science-policy adviser and director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, respectively.LiNeBrEaKThe latter two have both been past presidents of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and McArthur Fellows. To receive any of these honors you must have the respect of not only the peers in your field of interest but of the whole scientific community.LiNeBrEaKWhat makes these candidates even more remarkable is that they challenge the very stereotypes that define scientists on television and in movies   the laughable and comedic nerds unable to communicate with the public, and who get lost in the Ivory Tower. (Please note that I am not providing a blanket denial of these stereotypes. These sorts of people exist.) However, Obama s nominees have proven records of persuasively communicating science and their opinions   something that has been requested by policymakers and legislators for decades. They are true professionals who understand policy, have testified for Congress, and advised presidents. Simply put, they are the rare scientific renaissance people. I hope that they will inspire generations of scientists to act more like them.LiNeBrEaKLike all scientists, Mr. Obama s choices have traveled down pathways that telescoped into increasingly specialized fields. However, they also have exhibited wisdom   the ability to ask the right questions the right way at the right time and the ability to find clarity within apparent chaos. They know the methodology and the codes and mores of the science community. They may not know the facts of gene-splicing or astrophysics, but they know how scientists think and talk and what motivates them. And, most importantly, they have proved that they know how to get things done.LiNeBrEaKI applaud the president-elect s decision to surround himself with such gifted minds.LiNeBrEaKWill they succeed? Hard to predict. We need more data.LiNeBrEaKChris Reddy, an occasional contributor, is a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	Mapping Rhode Island s oceanic waters  	COMMENTARY; Pg. 7  	773 words  	OVER THE NEXT two years, the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council will be developing something groundbreaking: the Ocean Special Area Management Plan (Ocean SAMP), a two-year research and planning process that will zone the state s off-shore waters.LiNeBrEaKThe CRMC recognizes that Rhode Island s coastal and offshore waters are already heavily used, and will continue to face new development pressure. This zoning will designate offshore waters to protect a variety of high-priority uses and habitats for commercial fishing; critical habitats for fish, marine animals, and birds; marine transport; and more. LiNeBrEaKAmong many other responsibilities, the CRMC is charged with managing the state s submerged lands. The CRMC has been zoning the state s waters since 1983, for uses ranging from conservation areas to industrial ports, so this is familiar territory for the council. All eyes will be on the CRMC and the State of Rhode Island   across the country and internationally   as the planning process comes to a close and the CRMC implements its seventh and largest SAMP.LiNeBrEaKOne of the major uses that will be identified through the SAMP s scientific research process is possible siting locations for alternative energy, namely wind farms. Using the best available science, along with public input and involvement, the CRMC hopes to identify areas most suitable for these wind farms where other off-shore uses will not be compromised. With the cooperation and scientific resources of the University of Rhode Island   the university has pooled an elite team of researchers   the CRMC will work during the first year to map the off-shore waters.LiNeBrEaKThe concept for the Ocean SAMP was born through the realization that global warming is a reality and that Rhode Island is particularly susceptible to its affects. Global warming is perhaps the most critical issue of the 21st Century. It is already accelerating sea-level rise, leading to beach-erosion property losses and increasing Rhode Island s vulnerability to hurricanes and floods. Climate change may hurt our food supply, public health and the economy. Rhode Island is committed to reducing its carbon footprint by using renewable energy resources   primarily offshore wind farms   to meet 15 percent of its energy needs. The CRMC leadership decided that one way to address this issue was to provide room for renewable energy in the state s long-term plan   and a special area management plan, or SAMP, was the best way to do it.LiNeBrEaKThe CRMC has federal authority to develop and implement SAMPs through the Federal Coastal Zone Management Act, and has been developing SAMPs since 1983 when it adopted the Providence Harbor SAMP. Since then, the CRMC has adopted and implemented four more in the state, is finishing an update of the Providence Harbor   now called Metro Bay   SAMP and is also working on a SAMP for the west side of Aquidneck Island. SAMPs, by design, are ecosystem-based management strategies that are consistent with the council s mandate to preserve and restore ecological systems. Through the process, the CRMC coordinates with local municipalities, as well as government agencies and community organizations, to prepare the SAMPs and implement the management strategies.LiNeBrEaKWorking alongside the CRMC in the SAMP development effort is a constant fixture and invaluable resource   the University of Rhode Island and its Coastal Resources Center. The CRMC has called upon the extensive expertise of the Coastal Resources Center (CRC) and university for all of its SAMPs, and the Ocean SAMP effort magnifies those efforts. A highly regarded, world-renowned team of scientists is conducting studies on current and potential future uses of the off-shore waters for this project. Some of the university scientists are also conducting research and data collection aboard the research vessel Endeavor in October.LiNeBrEaKDevelopment of a special area management plan in two years is an ambitious goal, but this is one of many things for which the CRMC has been recognized as a national leader. A draft is scheduled to be presented to the council for adoption by February, with a completed Ocean SAMP to be presented to the council for adopt by February 2010.LiNeBrEaKWith five other SAMPs successfully under the agency s belt, the Ocean SAMP would be the largest-scale plan to date.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday   Metro Edition	PAY THE REAL COSTS OF TRANSPORTATION  	EDITORIAL; Pg. B9  	628 words  	On Christmas, The Roanoke Times printed an article reporting how heavy trucks cause far more damage to highways than the fees they pay, ("Trucks toll on roads outweighs fees paid").LiNeBrEaKAccording to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the interstate highway system was built to sustain automobile use without damage. They say that almost all of the damage to the interstate highways is caused by trucks. In order to accomplish economic recovery and sustained economic growth we have to stay focused on the facts.LiNeBrEaKOur governments have unfairly subsidized trucking while suppressing railroads. I don't think that was the intent, but we charged the railroads so much in property taxes that they were economically forced to rip up and trash half of their rail infrastructure when our policies should have encouraged them to improve what they had and to build more. LiNeBrEaKThat is why our rail system is 50 to 100 years behind the rest of the industrialized world. We need to include the costs and payoffs of building a modern railroad in our focus. The heads of most state departments of transportation have never seen a modern railroad. We cannot rely on their experience in these matters.LiNeBrEaKWe also need to focus on our goals for transportation.LiNeBrEaKOne is that we need to move freight as cheaply as possible. To be viable and useful, freight has to be moved at the speed and reliability of our trucking system.LiNeBrEaKThe cost of building a rail bed is about 10 percent of a road bed of the same freight capacity. Over the long haul, the cost of building the rail bed is on par with the road repair bill that is avoided with the loads it carries. Rails move freight for about 10 percent of the fuel used by trucks.LiNeBrEaKFurthermore, rail lines can be electrified so that the fuel is consumed in large power plants and delivered by transmission lines. That way the pollution per unit of fuel is less. And the power plants can change to wind, solar cell, solar thermal, water, geothermal, tidal generators or whatever is the cheapest in the future.LiNeBrEaKFirst, however, we need to build a modern rail infrastructure so we have all the options. Then, if everyone pays his own share of repair bills and pays for the pollution that must be cleaned up, the free market system will determine how the shippers will utilize trucks, trains and planes. But the free-market system works only when all the costs are fairly paid.LiNeBrEaKThe cost to the environment must be included in the price. Climate change is just beginning, but storms are already getting bigger and more frequent. The prevailing west-to-east winds do not just flow smoothly. Turbulence in the jet stream is what brings us warm and cold snaps. Global warming brings greater turbulence, and we are already seeing more extreme arctic chills and then incredible warm spells.LiNeBrEaKThe cost of mitigating global warming will be very great. The cost of inaction will be far worse.LiNeBrEaKThe other goal of a transportation system is to move people with the best time and service at a good price. A modern freight railroad would provide the capacity to put passenger cars between fast freight trains. Such a train would get me to Washington faster than I could drive, much more safely and with about 10 percent the carbon production.LiNeBrEaKIn order for the free-market system to select the best economic choices, we need to take the blinders off. Instead of hiding the real costs behind taxes and tax breaks, we must all pay the true costs for what we do. If we let the chips fall where they may, and we have all three transportation systems to choose from, then the free market economy will guide us to the decisions that make us the most competitive economically.LiNeBrEaKBob PeckmanLiNeBrEaKPeckman, of Roanoke, is a jazz drummer and retired ITT engineer and physicist.

San Antonio Express-News 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday   T210 Edition	So that's what it's like to get lost in a cornfield on Christmas  	210 SA; Pg. 6T  	454 words  	Corn. By itself the word is rather nondescript. But such a small word to describe such an amazing thing.LiNeBrEaKIt can be made into bread, soup, roasted, popped, grilled or baked into a casserole. There is sweet, regular or frozen. You can eat it plain or dress it up. LiNeBrEaKSome highly subsidized individuals have even turned it into automobile fuel.LiNeBrEaKWebster's Dictionary says corn is "a small, hard seed, of cereal grass. An American cereal plant with kernels growing in rows along a woody, husk-enclosed core. Maize."LiNeBrEaKHowever, corn in its purest essence can be explained thusly - any time period not lasting less than several days spent enduring movie after movie on the Hallmark Channel.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, I hear that is how we break the most hardened scumbags who populate the prison at our naval base in Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba.LiNeBrEaKThat said, I spent the holidays like a terrorist.LiNeBrEaKThe Hallmark Channel is to glib corn what Lifetime Television is to paranoid cheese. I know this because I've spent the past couple of days in the family holiday trenches, dodging corn puff, patriotic gobbledygook and unreal, feel-good nonsense movies. I'm not complaining here, just decompressing.LiNeBrEaKIt could have been worse, I could be related to folks who really like fishing and hunting shows and ended up watching an Outdoor Channel Christmas.LiNeBrEaKSo, as it is, I was very grateful to have watched hours of movies featuring families separated by tragic misunderstanding, then suddenly finding each other after decades separated by racial lines. Or the dozens of movies in which justice is served at the last second by the one person you did not expect, the horse.LiNeBrEaKThen, there were the "you never wanted me anyway so I'll just become a war hero" flicks, and finally, the "you're only misunderstood, but I'll stand by you with unconditional love - oh wait - I'm dead, grab a tissue."LiNeBrEaKThese are some of the many plots my brain simmered in this past festive season.LiNeBrEaKI think my eyes rolled so hard they fell down into my colon.LiNeBrEaKBut darn it, after the first four movies, I found myself beginning to like these escapist flicks.LiNeBrEaKMy favorite was the Civil War movie with the special horse and confederate soldiers. It was a tearjerker. The confederates repented of their racist ways and switched sides after the horse "Goldy" saved a dying person who was drowning in a flood caused by pre-global warming.LiNeBrEaKThey just threw down their rifles, turned their jackets inside out to the blue side, put on some shoes and started humming the "Battle Hymn of the Republic."LiNeBrEaKWe later found out that the horse was none other than the Spirit of Boxing Day incarnate.LiNeBrEaKOK, that's not how the movie went. But I was sleepy and began to hallucinate after hours of nonstop Hallmark movies and a diabetic sugar rush.

The Santa Fe New Mexican (New Mexico)  	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	Jones tapped to lead PRC: New chairman may take more cautious approach to alternative energy projects  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	510 words  	Jan. 7--In an unexpected move, the Public Regulation Commission changed leadership Tuesday, with Sandy Jones of Southern New Mexico replacing Jason Marks of the Albuquerque area as chairman on a 4-1 vote. LiNeBrEaKIt remains to be seen whether the change reflects an ideological shift on the PRC, which has been pushing utilities to subsidize more renewable-energy projects.LiNeBrEaK"It's hard to say," said a dejected-looking Marks, who was the lone dissenter in both the votes for Jones as chairman and David King as vice chairman.LiNeBrEaKNew Commissioner Jerome Block Jr., who represents much of Northern New Mexico and remains under investigation by the state Attorney General's Office over his spending of public campaign money, nominated King for vice chairman.LiNeBrEaKMarks said he and former Commissioner Ben Ray Lujan, who was just sworn into Congress, worked to make the leadership post "a weak chairmanship" after prior chairmen reigned over resources and the flow of information.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think that we'll return to that," Marks said.LiNeBrEaKJones, a 52-year-old former road-building contractor who lives in Sierra County, said he sees himself as just one of five commissioners who happens to run the meetings.LiNeBrEaKAsked about the differences between him and Marks, he suggested he will move more cautiously on alternative energy. Nearly half of the residents in his district are 150 percent or more below the poverty line, and he doesn't want the cost of alternative energy "on their backs" when people such as doctors, lawyers and college professors can afford solar panels.LiNeBrEaK"Why would we subsidize these people when they have the ability to pay for it?" he said.LiNeBrEaKBut Jones, who believes in global warming, said there is a need for alternative energy, which he said can't become cost-efficient until someone comes up with viable, large-scale energy storage systems.LiNeBrEaKAlternative-energy groups have been pushing for a faster expansion of solar power.LiNeBrEaKLast month, they urged the PRC to increase how much the state's largest utility, Public Service Company of New Mexico, pays residential customers who install rooftop solar panels. Some sought as much as 30 cents per kilowatt hour, but the PRC wound up keeping it at 13 cents.LiNeBrEaK"I support anybody who supports an aggressive renewable energy plan that causes us to make difficult decisions," said Patrick Griebel, an Albuquerque solar-company executive and a member of the Renewable Energy Industries Association of New Mexico. "But I don't know if a (new chairman) signals a shift."LiNeBrEaKThe PRC regulates industries such as utilities, telecommunications and insurance.LiNeBrEaKContact Doug Mattson at 986-3087 or dmattson@sfnewmexican.com	ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (90%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (89%); SOLAR ENERGY (89%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (89%); EXECUTIVE MOVES (89%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); POOR POPULATION (74%); CAMPAIGN FINANCE (74%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (74%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (74%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (71%); ROAD and BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION (66%); GLOBAL WARMING (62%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS (60%); INVESTIGATIONS (55%); HIGHWAYS and STREETS (52%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (50%); BUSINESS and PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (66%)  	BEN RAY LUGAN (56%)  	NEW MEXICO, USA (97%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	January 7, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Santa Fe New Mexican   	Doug Mattson, The Santa Fe New Mexican  				Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	SIC4931 ELECTRIC and OTHER SERVICES COMBINED (84%) General  	20090107-SF-Jones-tapped-to-lead-PRC-0107  	SF  		PUBLIC SERVICE CO OF NEW MEXICO (84%); SANTA FE NEW MEXICAN INC (50%)  												
San Gabriel Valley Tribune (California) 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	Gullible warming activists  	OPINION  	416 words  	Usually the gullible warming activists hibernate for the winter when their message is hard to swallow through chattering teeth.LiNeBrEaKSo it was a surprise to see in the Star-News (Dec. 10) an AP article about the United Nations, that bastion of wisdom and goodness, and their scientists claiming proof positive that global warming is real. LiNeBrEaKOf course, no details of this "proof" were offered in the article. One of the research-grant money-grubbing scientists said that the battle is over regarding the debate.LiNeBrEaKFunny, but we never really had a debate especially in the agenda-driven media.LiNeBrEaKNotice how Al Gore and his ilk never have publicly debated the other side on this and they never will. It would be too easy for them to stumble over their "facts."LiNeBrEaKYou can get that other side of the story that the media will never report to you but you must make an effort to find it.LiNeBrEaKLearn how 650 dissenting scientists plan to counter the 52 UN scientists by doing a Google search at EPW.SENATE.GOV. At that site click on the Minority page and in the search box enter UN Blowback.LiNeBrEaKYou will than be amazed at the information compiled by Marc Murano regarding this fraud of the century that has been hidden from you.LiNeBrEaKWarning to global-warming religious believers, this information will be quite disturbing, but it could set you free. Now turn on your electric blankets.LiNeBrEaKMichael Logan, PasadenaLiNeBrEaKArcadia too greedyLiNeBrEaKThe city of Arcadia gets my vote for "Greediest City in California" ("Arcadia seeks federal dollars," Star-News, Dec. 28).LiNeBrEaKThe fact that Arcadia, which has both median home values and household incomes well above the California average (and above Pasadena's), is paying one of the nation's largest lobbying firms to get more government funds ought to motivate taxpayers to write their elected officials to put a stop to this nonsense.LiNeBrEaKI mean, after the banks, insurance companies and auto industry, Arcadia should be called for a piling-on penalty.LiNeBrEaKLast time I checked, nobody is writing folks struggling to make ends meet a check.LiNeBrEaKI'm sure Arcadia's city manager is well meaning, but something like a federally funded bicycle lane ought to be at the bottom of the priority list for whatever dollars are being doled out by Washington.LiNeBrEaKEven Arcadia's water infrastructure project needs to take a back seat, unless it can be proven that the project will result in the creation of meaningful local jobs.LiNeBrEaKOur state has far more pressing needs like schools and roadways that need to be fixed first.LiNeBrEaKTom Cartwright, Pasadena	EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (77%); RESEARCH (77%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (72%); CITY GOVERNMENT (69%); LOBBYING (66%); PUBLIC FINANCE (65%); INFRASTRUCTURE (63%); RELIGION (50%); INSURANCE (50%)  	AL GORE (57%)  	LOS ANGELES, CA, USA (78%) CALIFORNIA, USA (91%) UNITED STATES (91%)  	January 8, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 MediaNews Group, Inc. and Los Angeles Newspaper Group, Inc.

The State (Columbia, South Carolina)  	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	Fight over new coal plant intensifies: Business interests tout need for electricity while conservationists decry air, water pollution  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	506 words  	Jan. 7--The state's leading business groups renewed their call Tuesday for a coal-fired power plant in Florence County at the same time conservationists announced a new, broader coalition to oppose the $2. 2 billion facility along the Great Pee Dee River. LiNeBrEaKTuesday's developments are the latest in an increasingly bitter fight over how to supply more power without polluting the state's air and water.LiNeBrEaKThe Santee Cooper coal plant would be built in the economically depressed, job-starved Pamplico area of eastern South Carolina. But the plant also would release tons of greenhouse gases and 93 pounds of toxic mercury annually along a river already plagued by mercury-poisoned fish.LiNeBrEaKAt a news conference on the State House steps, executives with the S.C. Chamber of Commerce and the S.C. Manufacturers Alliance said the coal plant is needed to maintain power for existing industries and provide an enticement for new ones.LiNeBrEaK"Affordable, reliable electricity is probably one of the most key components to the survival of business in this state," said Otis Rawl, president of the S.C. Chamber of Commerce. Rawl said the state's population is expected to increase by 1 million people in the next 15 years, creating more energy demand.LiNeBrEaKThe National Federation of Independent Business and the Pee Dee Supporters for Progress also attended Tuesday's news conference. Building the coal plant near Pamplico is part of an overall strategy South Carolina must pursue to supply electricity, which also includes more nuclear power, business officials said.LiNeBrEaKConservation groups said Santee Cooper can provide power by being more efficient and using alternate sources of energy instead of building a new coal plant. Environmentalists will hold a news conference at 12: 30 p.m. today at USC to discuss a coalition and Web site against the plant.LiNeBrEaK"We really want to broaden the effort and make our elected officials and governor and whoever else will listen aware that this is not just a fight that is going on in Florence," said the S.C. Coastal Conservation League's Nancy Cave.LiNeBrEaKBruce Nilles, a national Sierra Club expert on coal plants, will speak today as will Florence Mayor Stephen Wukela.LiNeBrEaKNew federal policies by incoming President Barack Obama may make it harder to build coal-fired power plants. For now, the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control has approved an air permit for the coal plant. The DHEC board is to discuss Thursday whether to hear an appeal of the permit by conservationists. Santee Cooper also needs other permits, including a major state water quality certification.LiNeBrEaKThe plant could begin providing energy as soon as 2013.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday   4 State / Suncoast Edition	IN A PERILOUS WORLD, WEAK PICK FOR CIA  	NATIONAL; TIMES EDITORIALS; Pg. 8A  	545 words  	President-elect Barack Obama clearly had trouble filling out his intelligence team. His efforts to find someone to head the Central Intelligence Agency reportedly ran into snags when his first choices were tainted by connections to the Bush administration's wrong-headed interrogation and rendition policies. But Obama's selection of Leon Panetta for CIA director raises different concerns and is perhaps the weakest of the incoming president's nominations for top positions. LiNeBrEaKIn a stark contrast to President Bush's preference for ideologues and loyalists, Obama has done a remarkable job of filling out his administration with highly qualified people. Choices like Nobel laureate in physics Steven Chu, for energy secretary, who has been a leader on climate change issues; and Timothy Geithner, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, for the Treasury Department, are prime examples of Obama tapping experience and expertise.LiNeBrEaKCompare these picks to Panetta, a former chief of staff for President Clinton and an eight-term congressman. He has a long connection to Democratic politics but little background in intelligence operations, beyond some work as an intelligence officer in the Army in the early 1960s. Was he really the best candidate?LiNeBrEaKPanetta is known as an exemplary manager, and to his credit he has been an outspoken critic of the CIA's enhanced interrogation program. But he lacks the depth of knowledge to pursue the goals of enhancing foreign intelligence gathering and analysis while reforming the CIA into an agency that comports with American and international legal standards.LiNeBrEaKIt should catch the president-elect's attention that leading Democrats in Congress are expressing skepticism about Panetta. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the new chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, telegraphed her disapproval in a terse statement - a view reportedly shared by the outgoing chair, Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. Their concerns aren't universal, and there is praise coming from some comforting sources. Former Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, who once chaired the Senate intelligence panel and was a member for a decade, expressed confidence in Panetta. "He understands the needs of users of intelligence. That's very valuable as he shapes and leads the principle human intelligence agency of the United States," Graham told the online Washington Independent. Others who expressed support for the nomination pointed to how close Panetta is to the incoming president, potentially giving the CIA special prominence and positioning.LiNeBrEaKThroughout the history of the CIA there have been successful directors from both inside and outside the agency. William Casey came to the post after heading up Ronald Reagan's bid for president and was a highly political pick, though even he had experience in intelligence operations at the agency that was a forerunner of the CIA.LiNeBrEaKIt is possible that Panetta, once he gets immersed in the agency, will turn out fine. But will the Obama administration have the time in this dangerous world for Panetta to get up to speed? A new president a bit short on experience in this area himself should have sought someone with more seasoning to lead an agency with more of its share of issues and turf battles.

Tampa Tribune (Florida) 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	LETTERS  	LOCAL NEWS; Pg. 13  	1021 words  	LETTER OF THE DAYLiNeBrEaKWatch Out For T-RexLiNeBrEaK"We're out of time. Things are going extinct." So said a Stanford University biologist (Terry Root) alarmed about global warming ("Obama Can't Wait To Tackle Climate," Views, Dec. 28).LiNeBrEaKWow, I didn't know. And here I was, selfishly glad that a Tyrannosaurus Rex wasn't snapping at my rear end. LiNeBrEaKLOUIS SCHNEIDERLiNeBrEaKHolidayLiNeBrEaKPriorities Upside DownLiNeBrEaKDuring my 12-year tenure as a state legislator in New Hampshire, I had the responsibility at one point to serve as chairman of the House Committee on State Institutions in order to oversee the operation and standards of our Youth Development Center (YDC) along with other state facilities. Governmental overview of state institutions is always needed, although experience shows that it is seldom productive.LiNeBrEaKFrom my appraisal of the situation as reported in the Tribune, it would seem that Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration is overlooking some important issues by recommending the removal of the license for Tampa Bay Academy.LiNeBrEaKPriorities seem to be all upside down. Children in need of 24-hour mental health care are being removed from unhealthy and dangerous surroundings, and yet only one-third of the employees who oversee their protection and care are being removed. In addition, two-thirds of the rest of this same group of negligent and inattentive personnel are sheltered from the agency's order by virtue of their positions in the academy's group homes and charter school and therefore retain their jobs, salaries, health care benefits and pensions.LiNeBrEaKWhy retain 15 staff members to rebuild another facility like the substandard one they now manage? Wouldn't it make more sense to start at the top? To dismiss the current managerial staff and bring in new individuals with better credentials who would, in turn, qualify and dismiss inadequate and disinterested personnel at all levels and replace them with compassionate, caring and well-educated caretakers?LiNeBrEaKCoincidentally, the cost to remove 15 at the top of the food chain might even help balance the agency budget and allow the hiring of a couple of new therapists.LiNeBrEaKELSIE VARTANIANLiNeBrEaKTampaLiNeBrEaKLook Outside PinellasLiNeBrEaKRegarding "Rays Identify 7 Potential Stadium Sites In Pinellas" by Russell Ray (Dec. 31):LiNeBrEaKEver since the new stadium discussions started, I have been stunned by the fact that the Rays organization does not realize how much they could increase their fan base and resulting ticket sales by relocating east of Tampa somewhere near the I-75/I-4 corridor. This would allow access to an additional 1. 5 million fans in Orange, Citrus, Hernando and Polk counties who may find it too far to travel to a game now, while at the same time remaining within a reasonable driving distance for fans in Pinellas, Hillsborough, Manatee and Sarasota counties.LiNeBrEaKFor a team still concerned about low attendance even after a winning season, this seems like a no-brainer. If we build it, they will come.LiNeBrEaKLYNN BARNHARDTLiNeBrEaKTampaLiNeBrEaKHillsborough's The PlaceLiNeBrEaKWhen you offer free parking, the lowest ticket prices in the league, your team makes the World Series and you still can't sell out regular season games (unless the Red Sox or Yankees are playing), then maybe it's time to consider a significantly different stadium site.LiNeBrEaKI suggest that Pinellas County will not support a baseball team, and it's a waste of time and money to build a new venue for the team anywhere near the current one (like the seven proposed sites). Something in Hillsborough County near the fairgrounds or Ford Amphitheatre would draw from Lakeland and Orlando, as well as north Tampa.LiNeBrEaKPinellas residents have been given a chance. They have shown they cannot fully support a major league team.LiNeBrEaKDAVE MULLANLiNeBrEaKTampaLiNeBrEaKStorms Causes DivisionLiNeBrEaKRegarding "Library Savings Small Part Of Sen. Storms' Agenda" (Jan. 3):LiNeBrEaKSenator Ronda Storms defends herself quite eloquently. Perhaps some of her economic agenda is commendable, but the problem with Storms has always been perception. Whether she is railing against public television, bikini bars or the library system, etc., she continues to be a divisive figure with her actions and rhetoric.LiNeBrEaKI have always thought politicians should strive to unite people, and she continues to divide.LiNeBrEaKAs a resident of District 10, my opinion has always been that the senator is under-qualified, out of touch and that the compensation she receives is a waste of our tax dollars. However, over the years and through several elections, I remain in the minority.LiNeBrEaKKEITH LAPLANTLiNeBrEaKValricoLiNeBrEaKA Better PerspectiveLiNeBrEaKI am happy to see that Sen. Storms took the time to put some perspective on her agenda addressing the state budget. Unfortunately, Tribune reporter Catherine Dolinski, in her out-of-context, selective reporting of misinformation, had me questioning why Storms was nitpicking the Dewey Decimal System.LiNeBrEaKMaybe Dolinski should be writing sound bites for television.

The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	Owl that entertained Albany found dead  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	442 words  	Jan. 7--ALBANY -- The snowy owl that made appearances around downtown Albany in recent weeks, thrilling bird-watchers and first-time viewers, has died. LiNeBrEaKThe fallen owl was found on a rooftop on Broadway and was brought to the Department of Environmental Conservation on Tuesday afternoon. DEC wildlife pathologist Ward Stone the white-faced bird was carrying a fatal parasite called trichomonas gallinae.LiNeBrEaK"It had a lot of mouth lesions, which is caused by the trichomonas parasite," Stone explained. "It was probably acquired from eating a pigeon with a pathogenic strain."LiNeBrEaKStone said it is common for owls that come into the city to become ill from eating city rodents and pigeons. Typically, owls, which are not migratory birds, will only fly south when food in their native-arctic is scarce.LiNeBrEaK"Oh that is so sad," said Susan Watson-Ames when she heard the news of the owl's death. Watson-Ames works in the SUNY System Administration Building across from where the snowy took up it's perch last week and had come out to see it.LiNeBrEaK"It was such a beautiful bird that I couldn't take my eyes off of it," Watson-Ames recalled. A steady stream of employees in her building had lined the sidewalk to see the snowy. "I had let people know about it," said Watson-Ames. "I was like the town crier."LiNeBrEaKStone said it is likely the snowy died sometime Sunday or Monday. It usually takes a couple of days and possibly up to a week for a bird to die from the parasite.LiNeBrEaK"It is a shame that this beautiful bird is dead," said Stone, who partially attributed global warming to the owl's death, because it can disrupt plant growth and prey populations.LiNeBrEaK"If global warming impacts severely on the arctic and sub arctic we can expect dramatic declines in the population of the snowy," Stone said. He will continue to study the owl to make a full determination of the cause of death.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, Watson-Ames, who had made a mental note a few days ago to keep a look out for the snowy, hopes she'll get to see another.LiNeBrEaK"I mean, this was so rare," she said. "In a way it was like a sign of some sort. There's a saying if you see an owl its a bad thing, but if you see a snowy owl, it's good luck."

USA TODAY 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	Of fish and forests  	NEWS; Pg. 10A  	419 words  	President Bush certainly has a penchant for protecting remote ocean ecosystems. His announcement Monday that he would set aside 195,280 square miles of Pacific Ocean in the Mariana Islands and elsewhere, combined with an ocean preserve he created near Hawaii in 2006, brings his total of protected waters above 300,000 square miles. LiNeBrEaKThat's an area bigger than Bush's home state of Texas. It's more than any person has set aside before and likely will for the foreseeable future. And it is, without doubt, a commendable effort to protect wide swaths of richly diverse aquatic life from commercial exploitation and waste dumping.LiNeBrEaKThe action two weeks before he leaves office does, however, underscore one of the unfortunate aspects of Bush's environmental policy. He is better at acting on behalf of the environment when there is no substantial business interest arguing the other side.LiNeBrEaKCloser to home than the pristine waters off Guam, Bush's record is decidedly less favorable (though not as awful as some environmental groups assert). He has almost always sided with energy, automotive, timber and other financial interests in questions of how vigorously to protect the environment.LiNeBrEaKFor instance, Bush spent much of his administration resisting calls to take the threat of global warming seriously. When he came into office in 2001 he withdrew the United States from Kyoto Protocol on climate change. And he has largely ignored a 2007 Supreme Court ruling stating that the Environmental Protection Agency had to devise a plan to address the matter.LiNeBrEaKAlthough Bush did move to impose tighter regulations on power plant and diesel fuel emissions, he has blocked efforts by states to enact air emissions standards more stringent than those of the federal government.LiNeBrEaKMany of Bush's land use policies in the western part of the lower 48 states make sense only in a political context, as an effort to please a constituency of energy producers. He has pressed for greater logging in national forests and more accommodating regulations on coal mining. Several of his more benign environmental policies -- fuel efficiency standards on cars for instance, or more money for renewable fuels -- came only when Democrats claimed power on Capitol Hill or energy prices surged.LiNeBrEaKIt is in this context that Bush's conservation polices should be judged. While he deserves praise for his protection of the seas, it is impossible not to notice that by building an environmental legacy on remote ocean ecospheres he picked the easiest fights.

The Washington Post 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday   Every Edition	On the Road For Change;  The Goal: A Farm At the White House 	FOOD; Pg. F01  	1250 words  	Daniel Bowman Simon and Casey Gustowarow didn't really have a plan when they set off on a cross-country drive in a topsy-turvy school bus with herbs, greens and root vegetables planted on the roof. But they didn't think they needed one. Their cause seemed so pure, so obviously righteous: to persuade the next president of the United States to grow food on the White House lawn.LiNeBrEaKBut that was August. The days were bright and hot. And the only obstacle to an abundance of spinach and Swiss chard were 60-mph headwinds and highway fumes. In December, it was a different story. On one day when they were parked at the edge of Penn Quarter's Thursday farmers market, sheets of rain lashed the bus. It was too cold to sleep in the bus, too cold to grow anything on the roof, too miserable for anyone to stop and sign the White House Organic Farm (WHO Farm) petition.LiNeBrEaKSimon and Gustowarow have traveled through 25 states and collected 10,000 signatures. But they've yet to hear whether President-elect Barack Obama will consent to transform the South Lawn into a working farm. LiNeBrEaKSimon, 28, and Gustowarow, 27, aren't the first, or the most famous, to lobby for a White House garden. The idea became a cause celebre for food lovers during the presidential election campaign. Chez Panisse chef-owner Alice Waters and author Michael Pollan, gods of the sustainable-food movement, called on the new president to plant organic fruits and vegetables to feed the first family and stock local food pantries. In February, Maine gardener Roger Doiron launched an online campaign, dubbed Eat the View, with the same goal. Advocates say a first family garden could set an example for millions of Americans and, by promoting sustainable food, help tackle the awesome challenges of climate change, food safety and energy conservation.LiNeBrEaKThe pair have made great sacrifices for the cause. Gustowarow left his job on a farm near Annapolis to make the cross-country journey. Simon paid $42,000 for a yellow school bus with half of another bus welded upside down on its top.  Topsy Turvy, as the bus is known, was owned by Ben Cohen of Ben and Jerry's fame, who had it purpose-built to demonstrate what he saw as the country's upside-down budget priorities. The pair's four-month-long, 11,000-mile journey coincided with record prices at the gas pump -- and the bus averages only seven or eight miles to the gallon. "I'm in a lot of debt," Simon shrugs. "But it's what I'm excited about."LiNeBrEaKIn a time of war and recession, a garden might not be at the top of  the executive agenda. And it's not clear whether Simon and Gustowarow can put it there. They have little in common with many of the ambitious staffers who come to Washington. They're dreamers: soft-spoken, humble and more interested in their cause than in connections.LiNeBrEaKThe friends met in 2003 while working in the Philippines for the Peace Corps. After returning home, Gustowarow went to work on a farm; Simon went to New York to help develop green roof projects.LiNeBrEaKIn February, Simon attended a conference at Harvard University. There, Waters was honored and gave a speech in which she said that her two dreams were to create gardens at schools across the country and to see food grown on the White House lawn, as it had been in the past. Simon was inspired: "I thought, this is an idea that deserves a grassroots movement. Alice Waters is someone who deserves to have her dreams come true."LiNeBrEaKBefore setting off on their journey the pair contacted Waters, who blessed the venture. They set up a platform bed in the back of the bus, decked the ceiling with American flags and stocked the "kitchen" shelves with spices, oil, grains and ready-made soup. They planted herbs and root crops in lightweight soil on the roof, and on Aug. 4 they set off from New York to San Francisco. They had three weeks to make it to Slow Food Nation, the country's largest food festival, held on Labor Day weekend.LiNeBrEaKThere, Simon and Gustowarow parked the bus alongside the "victory garden" planted in front of San Francisco's City Hall, where they solicited signatures from thousands of like-minded food lovers. Pollan came aboard the bus for a chat. The pair even drove to Berkeley for lunch with Waters at Chez Panisse. They don't remember what they ate; "she picked the menu," Gustowarow says.LiNeBrEaKFrom there, they traveled organically across the South. Simon says they set their sights on places "where we would be preaching to the choir, then seeing where the choir led us." They visited schools in Oakland and Berkeley. In Arizona, they stopped in Flagstaff and Sedona, where they drove out to Republican presidential nominee John McCain's ranch, only to be  shooed away by the Secret Service.LiNeBrEaKIn Lubbock, Texas, they hooked up with cheesemaker Nancy Patton of Haute Goat Creamery. "I was having drinks with my father at the retirement village when the phone rang, and this kid told me he was driving across the country in an upside-down school bus. The first thing I'm thinking is, 'How did you get my number?' "LiNeBrEaKPatton, a self-described conservative Republican, was impressed, however. "I thought it was a different stop for someone to pitch a cause like that. We're pretty cowboy here," she says. Patton put out a local press release and booked Simon and Gustowarow on the local Fox morning news program. Then she called a friend and asked him to design some T-shirts for them.LiNeBrEaK"My approach is a little different than theirs," she says. "But I just appreciate what they are doing. My question is: Who would be against this?"LiNeBrEaKGood question. There is a history of  agriculture at the White House. Its first tenant, John Adams, planted  a garden shortly after taking up residence in 1800.  Woodrow Wilson  brought in sheep to mow and fertilize the White House lawn in 1918, an effort to conserve resources for the war effort. In 1943, over the objection of the Agriculture Department, Eleanor Roosevelt planted a victory garden, inspiring millions of Americans to grow their own food.LiNeBrEaKSince then, however, only herbs have been grown at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Jimmy Carter, a Georgia farmer who extolled the virtues of gardening during his campaign, declined calls in 1978 to plant a vegetable garden at the White House. The issue has not been raised again seriously until now.LiNeBrEaKThe WHO Farm petition goes further than other similar calls to action. Simon and Gustowarow want schoolchildren and disabled Americans to work in the White House garden, a request that might pose a tricky security challenge. (Simon says including more participants in the project will make it more viable.) They also ask, among other things, that the gardeners plant heirloom seeds and use compost made from food waste from the kitchens that serve the White House, congressional buildings and Supreme Court.LiNeBrEaKHe and Gustowarow plan to upload their petition to http://www.change.gov, the Obama-Biden transition Web site, before  the inauguration, then send it to the White House by mail. (The petition will remain open, Simon says, until there is a garden on the White House lawn. It can be signed at http://www.thewhofarm.org.)LiNeBrEaKIn the new year, Gustowarow is hoping to find a piece of land to farm. Simon will continue on his quest. "I'm not terribly optimistic this will happen the day [the Obamas] move into the White House," Simon says. "I think we've planted a seed -- no pun intended -- that opens up the possibility."LiNeBrEaKComing tomorrow: Adrian Higgins contemplates what a White House vegetable garden might entail, in the Home section.

Winston-Salem Journal (North Carolina)  	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	Winston-Salem Journal, N.C., Ask SAM column: Ask SAM  	LIFESTYLE  	853 words  	Jan. 7--Q. We purchased a computer from a store on Saturday. We hooked it up on Sunday afternoon and could not get it to work properly after several attempts. We returned the computer to the store with our receipt on Monday at noon. We explained the problem and asked for a refund. We did not feel confident buying another item. We were charged a 15 percent restocking charge for returning the computer. When we expressed our dismay at this charge, we were told that "everybody does it." I called several computer stores listed in the Yellow Pages and not one store had a "restocking charge." What do you think? -- L.R.LiNeBrEaKA. It is not unheard of for a store to charge a restocking fee for electronic items. We checked four retail chain stores that sell electronics, and all of them charge a restocking fee in at least some situations. LiNeBrEaKA store is not required to accept merchandise returns unless an item is defective. A store doesn't have to refund your money if an item is defective, but it must provide you with a replacement.LiNeBrEaKYou wanted a refund, not a replacement, and it is not clear whether the computer was defective, or whether the staff at the store attempted to find the source of the problem.LiNeBrEaKComputers are not always "plug and play." Setup may sometimes require technical assistance, which doesn't always mean that the computer is defective.LiNeBrEaKStore policies on refunds for returned items vary, especially electronics.LiNeBrEaKFor example, Target charges a restocking fee on certain electronic items if the item is not in its original packaging. For online purchases, Target charges a 15 percent restocking fee for such items as camcorders, digital cameras and computers. Some consumer electronics cannot be exchanged or replaced.LiNeBrEaKBest Buy charges a 15 percent restocking fee on opened notebook computers, projectors, camcorders, digital cameras, radar detectors, GPS navigation and in-car video systems. When special-order items are returned, there is a 25 percent fee.LiNeBrEaKOther stores we checked charge restocking fees for items that have been opened or items not in their original packaging.LiNeBrEaKBecause return and refund policies vary so much, customers should make sure that they understand the policy before they buy.LiNeBrEaKQ. I've seen the lightning and heard the thunder. How many days from now should I expect snow, according to the old wives' tale? -- A.S.LiNeBrEaKA. One tale we have heard is that if you hear thunder in winter, it will snow within 30 days. We've also heard that winter thunder predicts snow within a week. We also saw the lightning and heard the thunder on Monday night.LiNeBrEaKThunder in winter is less common than in summer. During warmer months, the sun warms the earth and the air rises, transferring the heat to the cooler air in the atmosphere. In the winter, the surface temperatures are colder, which makes the air more stable.LiNeBrEaKHere are other weather predictions we have heard before:LiNeBrEaK--Thunder in February means that there will be frost on the same day in May.LiNeBrEaK--"If there's thunder during Christmas week, winter will be anything but meek" is one tale. Another predicts that thunder in December means a mild winter.LiNeBrEaK--Schoolchildren believe that wearing their pajamas inside out and backward increases the likelihood of snow (and school cancellation).LiNeBrEaKQ. The gym where I work out is trying to eliminate providing paper towels to clean the equipment after use. We are supposed to bring our own towel and wipe the equipment. The gym has a very dirty-looking rag there for customers to use. This seems unsanitary to me. Considering that most people are not bringing their own towels to clean the equipment, it is not getting cleaned. Is this violating any health rules? -- T.B.LiNeBrEaKA. There are no specific sanitation codes that apply to health clubs, said Bob Whitwam, the director of environmental health services for the Forsyth County Health Department. The health department regulates public swimming pools, hot tubs and spas. If a fitness club has a pool or a spa, the health department regulates only that area.LiNeBrEaK"If there was enough of a health concern, a local or state board could take action," Whitwam said. "But this is more of a quality-of-service issue. The membership of the club would be the ones responsible to put pressure on the owners."LiNeBrEaKWitness neededLiNeBrEaKTo an accident that happened at 9: 45 a.m. on Dec. 23 at the intersection of Lewisville-Vienna and Grapevine roads in Lewisville. The vehicles involved were a tan Buick Century, a white Jeep and a small white or gray car of unknown make. A vehicle that hit the other cars and left the scene lost its hood.

Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News 	January 7, 2009 Wednesday 	New Green Task Force aims to keep H.B. a cool city  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	498 words  	Jan. 7--After a year and a half, Hermosa Beach has done away with the Green Building Committee and replaced it with a more official and focused group that will strive to make the city as a whole more environmentally friendly. LiNeBrEaKResident Dency Nelson was chair of the Green Building Committee, which was supposed to be one of five groups that focused on making Hermosa Beach greener. However, none of the other groups were ever formed and public interest in the GBC started to fizzle.LiNeBrEaKA few months ago, Nelson was talking to Community Development Director Ken Robertson about the committee lacking support. During their conversation, both agreed the unofficial GBC should be scratched and the City Council should officially approve a new board that would cover a broader scope.LiNeBrEaKIn November, the council unanimously approved Robertson and Nelson's recommendation and formally created the Green Task Force.LiNeBrEaK"We've come to the same conclusion that this is very important and should be a priority for the city," Nelson said. "Now we have a more focused and dedicated task force that is almost at the commission level."LiNeBrEaKThe GTF is currently accepting applications until Feb. 19 to fill the five seats. Its first meeting will most likely be held in March once the members are chosen, Robertson said. There will also be a sixth seat open for a School District representative to emphasize environmental education, he added.LiNeBrEaKRobertson said since the GTF is an appointed group by the City Council, it should create more interest from environmental enthusiasts, thus providing more leadership and direction for how Hermosa Beach can hold true to being a "cool city."LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, Hermosa Beach became the first town in the area to become a cool city and made a commitment to help stop global warming and improve the environment. Nelson hopes the new task force will keep the city on track to achieve its goals.LiNeBrEaKThe GTF will begin focusing on how to reduce the city's carbon footprint by creating ways to make transportation, new construction, remodeling and recycling more friendly to the environment, said Nelson, who plans to apply for one of the open seats.LiNeBrEaKNelson said even though the GBC and other groups never turned into what he'd hoped for, he's certain this task force will take off and gain in popularity since it's officially being supported by the city.LiNeBrEaK"Hermosa Beach is doing the best it can," Nelson said. "The city must obtain the goals of the Cool Cities Initiative so that Hermosa Beach remains one."LiNeBrEaKApplications can be obtained on the city's Web site at www.hermosabch.org	GREEN BUILDING (90%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); CITIES (89%); CITY GOVERNMENT (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS and INSTITUTIONS (76%); CONSTRUCTION (73%); TALKS and MEETINGS (73%); SCHOOL DISTRICTS (65%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  			January 8, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009    	Eric Michael Stitt, The Beach Reporter, Manhattan Beach, Calif.

Albuquerque Journal (New Mexico)  	January 6, 2009 Tuesday 	Board Considers Limiting Emissions  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	383 words  	Jan. 6--A state regulatory commission Monday agreed to consider using its powers to limit greenhouse gas emissions in the state.LiNeBrEaKThe move, pushed by environmentalists and opposed by industry, opens a new front in the debate over how to respond to industrial pollutants scientists say are contributing to climate change. LiNeBrEaKThe vote by the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board set a hearing for August on the question. But before that hearing can be held, the board also agreed to give opponents a chance to argue their case that regulating greenhouse gases is beyond the board's legal mandate.LiNeBrEaKThe petition to the board, filed by the group New Energy Economy and the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, is an effort to impose more strict greenhouse gas emission standards than currently being considered by state officials, said John Fogarty, New Energy Economy's executive director.LiNeBrEaKFogarty's group wants to roll back New Mexico emissions 25 percent below their 1990 levels by 2020. Fogarty said in an interview Monday the number was based on the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- "the best available science."LiNeBrEaKNew Mexico state government has thrown its weight behind a more modest effort, working with a regional consortium of states and Canadian provinces to cut emissions 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.LiNeBrEaKFogarty's efforts Monday ran into strong opposition from industry representatives, who argue that the Environmental Improvement Board does not have the legal authority to regulate greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK"We do not believe the EIB has the statutory authority to do what they're being asked to do," said Bob Gallagher, executive director of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association. Gallagher said his organization favors a national measure, which the incoming Obama administration has said it plans to implement, rather than individual state measures.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 	January 6, 2009 Tuesday   Online Edition	Political Insider;  Winds of change: The 'flatulence tax' and you 		205 words  	Tuesday, January 6, 2009, 09: 58 AMLiNeBrEaKRedState.com today goes after the alleged "flatulence" tax, a so-far theoretical measure that would slap fees on cows, pigs and the greenhouse gases they produce. LiNeBrEaKThe Business and Media Institute has a fresh piece on the topic as well.LiNeBrEaKThere's little chance that the measure will pass muster with the Environmental Protection Agency, but farmers across the U.S. have been in a panic.LiNeBrEaKIn November, the New York Farm Bureau issued a warning that such a tax would be costly:LiNeBrEaKThe tax for dairy cows could be $175 per cow, and $87. 50 per head of beef cattle. The tax on hogs would upwards of $20 per hog.LiNeBrEaKAny operation with more than 25 dairy cows, 50 beef cattle or 200 hogs would have to obtain permits. This would cover about 99 percent of dairy production, more than 90 percent of beef production, and more than 95 percent of all hog production in New York, according to USDA statistics.LiNeBrEaKSo far as we know, the pork-and-beans industry --- a notorious source of methane, as Mel Brooks proved in "Blazing Saddles" --- has fended off all attempts to include its product in the discussion.LiNeBrEaKhttp://www.ajc.com/metro/content/shared-blogs/ajc/politicalinsider/entries/2009/01/06/winds_of_change_the_flatulence.html	DAIRY FARMING (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); HOG and PIG FARMING (77%); AGRICULTURE (77%); METHANE (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS (76%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (76%); DAIRY INDUSTRY (75%); TAXES and TAXATION (73%); BEEF CATTLE FARMING (57%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (56%) Blogs  		NEW YORK, USA (91%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 16, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspapers  	2009 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution   	JIM GALLOWAY; Staff  	NEW YORK FARM BUREAU (57%)  																				
Bangor Daily News (Maine)  	January 6, 2009 Tuesday 	Lectures to focus on climate change: University of Maine series to discuss research and life in 21st century  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	491 words  	Jan. 6--The concepts and theories behind the issue of climate change are complicated. Several University of Maine scientists and professors are hoping, however, to demystify, enlighten and perhaps even engage the public in the different ways they claim climate change affects our lives. LiNeBrEaKThe UMaine-based Climate Change Institute will hold "Climate Change on Planet Earth," a monthly lecture series that will feature specialists in areas related to climate change discussing their research as it relates to life in the 21st century.LiNeBrEaKThe lectures will be held in the Bangor Public Library's Lecture Hall and are free and open to the public. The talks start at 6: 30 p.m. and usually wrap up by 7: 45 p.m. The library is at 145 Harlow St.LiNeBrEaKNext up is a Jan. 14 talk by the coordinator of the series, Gregory Zaro, an assistant professor in the Climate Change Institute and anthropology department. Zaro will talk about his research in a lecture titled, "Ancient Civilizations, Archaeology and Environmental Change in South America."LiNeBrEaKZaro, who spends several months of the year in remote spots in Bolivia and southern Peru, will discuss how archaeology can reveal long-term ecological change and humans' role in that change.LiNeBrEaK"[There is] so much focus on industrial nations and pollution, but people don't understand there are thousands of years of human history before the industrialized era when people have had huge impacts on landscape and environment," Zaro said.LiNeBrEaKWhile Zaro will transport his audience to South and Central America, the February lecture will hit much closer to home next month when Joe Kelley, an earth sciences and Climate Change Institute professor, will deliver a lecture called "The Rise and Fall of the Maine Coast: People and a Drowning Shoreline." The date has not yet been set.LiNeBrEaKPaul Mayewski, a UMaine professor and the Climate Change Institute director, gave the opening lecture. He was followed by Steve Norton, a professor of geological sciences who is a specialist in atmospheric pollution.LiNeBrEaKAlthough several of the lecture topics are very specific, the goal is to get the public interested in a complex issue.LiNeBrEaK"We hear all these competing ideas and arguments about climate change," Zaro said. "I don't think the general public really understands what climate change is about and how we measure it. This presents an opportunity for people to come hear thoughts about particular subjects, ask questions and hear responses."LiNeBrEaKFor information on the lecture series, call 581-1857 or e-mail Gregory.Zaro@umit.maine.edu	CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); HUMANITIES and SOCIAL SCIENCE (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); ANTHROPOLOGY and ARCHAEOLOGY (90%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (78%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (78%); TALKS and MEETINGS (76%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (73%); AIR POLLUTION (72%); ARCHAEOLOGY (72%); COASTAL AREAS (70%); LIBRARIES (70%); PUBLIC LIBRARIES (70%)  		MAINE, USA (95%); EARTH (92%) UNITED STATES (95%); SOUTH AMERICA (93%); CENTRAL AMERICA (79%); BOLIVIA (79%); NORTH and SOUTH AMERICAS (50%)  	January 8, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Bangor Daily News   	Jessica Bloch, Bangor Daily News, Maine  	UNIVERSITY OF MAINE (93%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	General  	20090106-NG-Lectures-to-focus-on-climate-change-0106  	NG  		MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (60%)  												
Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 6, 2009 Tuesday 	Letters to the Editor  	MY TOWN; Alameda; Letters; News; Local  	709 words  	CO2 hysteriaLiNeBrEaKTHE TONE of the Dec. 19 My Word by Rich Godfrey, "Greenhouse gases   does Fremont care?" implied that human activity has a great deal to do with global warming and that carbon dioxide is a major culprit.LiNeBrEaKThe case can't be made for either assumption. If global warming were caused by human activity rather than the sun, why is Mars also warming? LiNeBrEaKWhile carbon dioxide is a very minor greenhouse gas, water vapor is 1,000 to 10,000 times more abundant in the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKMany people are anxious to accept global warming and the need to control CO2 emissions. Fossil fuels make an easy target for government control of people and for taxes.LiNeBrEaKMuch of the hysteria about CO2 danger was promulgated by Al Gore, who has a huge stake in brokering carbon off-sets and alternative energy production.LiNeBrEaKIt's all about money and control.LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide is produced by natural causes in greater abundance than by human activity. The recent fires in California alone produced more CO2 than all the cars in the state would emit in 50 to 100 years.LiNeBrEaKFurthermore, methane is 23 times more effective as a greenhouse gas and I don't see how we can stop vegetation from decomposing, or cows from passing gas.LiNeBrEaKHarold ManleyLiNeBrEaKFremontLiNeBrEaKMore than a turf warLiNeBrEaKTHE DEC. 30 article, "Bridge Brouhaha," described a situation that is sadly an accurate example of how dysfunctional California has become.LiNeBrEaKTwo unions, both of which have assisted in providing their members and their members' families good wages and benefits, recently were involved in an unseemly Port of Oakland squabble over unloading a ship that contained important steel beams for the San Francisco Bay Bridge reconstruction. Unfortunately, all this impasse did was to delay construction of a critically needed element of infrastructure and probably add to the bridge's cost.LiNeBrEaKThe article missed the most important element of the drama at the port. The ship, the Zhen Hua, is carrying steel beams from China. China? What happened to America's steel industry?LiNeBrEaKFormerly the world's leader in production and innovation, our steel mills apparently can't compete with China.LiNeBrEaKWhen the ship   not constructed in America because our shipbuilding industry no longer builds ships for our diminishing maritime fleet   returns to China, it will most likely be empty because America's economy imports far more than we export.LiNeBrEaKThat fact is more important than the turf warfare between two unions.LiNeBrEaKRobert C. DouglassLiNeBrEaKFremontLiNeBrEaKState budget disgraceLiNeBrEaKIT IS a disgrace to be a Californian these days, considering the state of negotiations over our unbalanced state budget.LiNeBrEaKMy recommendations:LiNeBrEaK1. Sales tax on everything, including food. This would tap into the underground cash economy that is not taxed. Everyone would be paying their fair share.LiNeBrEaK2. Crack down on the cash economy that is not reported or taxed. About $25 billion goes to Mexico on an annual basis. How much of that total comes from California and is that money taxed before it is sent out?LiNeBrEaK3. No more services for illegal immigrants. Why should I pay for schooling for an illegal when students who are citizens and legal residents have to have their schooling cut?LiNeBrEaK4. All California elected officials must take a 25 percent cut in pay and lose all of the extra perks, (cars, gas cards, etc). They don't get paid until the budget is passed. They also need to be fired for non-performance of their job descriptions.LiNeBrEaK5. Change the tax law so that homeowner association (HOA) fees are tax deductible or a portion is. Many homeowners must pay the fees in addition to their mortgage payment.LiNeBrEaKI encourage everyone to send a tea bag to Sacramento and call their elected official and complain.LiNeBrEaKGail Pi-GonzalezLiNeBrEaKFremontLiNeBrEaKBring back comic stripLiNeBrEaKHAVE YOU noticed? The Argus decided to drop "Hi and Lois" from its comic strip lineup.LiNeBrEaKIt has been replaced by some strip titled "The Knight Life."LiNeBrEaKI have been a long time "Hi and Lois" fan, and I am not happy about this.LiNeBrEaKWhy did they decide not to ask us readers first? I would have told them to drop "Sally Forth."LiNeBrEaKDoes any newspaper really care about the few readers they have anymore? It seems they do not.LiNeBrEaKPlease return "Hi and Lois" to your comic strip lineup right away and please consider bringing it back to your Sunday comic strip lineup.LiNeBrEaKPaul NielsenLiNeBrEaKFremont	LETTERS and COMMENTS (92%); GLOBAL WARMING (91%); EMISSIONS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); IRON and STEEL MILLS (88%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (88%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (88%); METHANE (78%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (77%); IMPORT TRADE (77%); AUTOMOTIVE FUELS (76%); CARBON OFFSETS (74%); BUDGET (74%); SALES TAX (74%); TAXES and TAXATION (70%); SHIPBUILDING (68%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (68%); WAGES and SALARIES (50%)  	AL GORE (56%)  	SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (93%); SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%); CHINA (94%)  	January 7, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved  	BAY AREA NEWS GROUP  									PORT OF OAKLAND (53%)  												
The Dallas Morning News (Texas)  	January 6, 2009 Tuesday 	Supporters outnumber protesters at hearing on proposed EFH nuclear reactors  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	673 words  	Jan. 6--GLEN ROSE -- If the turnout for Tuesday's public meeting on expansion of the nuclear plant is any sign, protesters might not pose much of a threat to Energy Future Holdings' plans to build two new reactors.LiNeBrEaKSome representatives of state environmental groups and a few local people expressed concern about the safety of the new reactor design, the impact on local water supply and storing nuclear waste onsite. LiNeBrEaK"I maintain that these reactors are not necessary," said Karen Hadden, executive director of the Sustainable Energy and Economic Development Coalition, an advocacy group. "There are so many ways to build the local economy without the risk of handling radioactive material."LiNeBrEaKMany more local politicians and business leaders stood up to tell the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which arranged the meeting, that EFH, formerly TXU Corp., has long been a good neighbor.LiNeBrEaK"We're not new to this process or new to this relationship," said Somervell County Judge Walter Maynard. "They've always been very good stewards of the water and the air and the land."LiNeBrEaKLuminant, the division of EFH that operates the Comanche Peak nuclear plant, filed an application last year to build and operate two new reactors here, bringing the total number to four. The company proposed using a new reactor design that hasn't yet been built.LiNeBrEaKTuesday's meeting is part of the commission's official process to handle those applications. The commission will consider input from the local community when deciding whether to approve the license.LiNeBrEaKHadden, who actively opposes nuclear plants around the state, agreed that local opposition appeared small on Tuesday.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think that's unusual," she said. Many people in Somervell and Hood counties work for the plant or know people who work for the plant, and "it takes a lot of courage" to oppose plant expansion.LiNeBrEaKFurther, several protesters complained that they first heard of the meeting on Christmas Eve, though people who support the plant found out about the meeting as early as December 17.LiNeBrEaK"It's definitely foul play," Hadden said.LiNeBrEaKRep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, said he's "perturbed" about the notification process.LiNeBrEaKHe also called on the commission to study whether the nuclear reactors have affected cancer rates in North Texas.LiNeBrEaKLuminant carefully prepared the groundwork for Tuesday's meeting. Jan Caldwell, community relations manager for the nuclear plant, has met with local officials to discuss the expansion.LiNeBrEaKSeveral commissioners courts and other political groups passed resolutions supporting the plant, sometimes at Caldwell's suggestion. She also helped write some resolutions.LiNeBrEaKA few supporters pointed out that nuclear plants don't emit greenhouse gases while operating and don't emit the kind of pollution coal plants spew. Other supporters sang the praises of Luminant.LiNeBrEaK"They've helped our economy to perform better than other places," said Granbury mayor pro tem Lisa Johnson. "We wish Luminant a speedy and successful application process."LiNeBrEaKOf course, community support could turn, as it did when TXU attempted to build 11 new coal-fired power plants. After high-profile politicians and business leaders publicly opposed the coal plants, TXU agreed to build only three plants.LiNeBrEaKBut for the nuclear reactors, there's likely a bigger threat: Paying for them. Executives have said unless the U.S. government can guarantee loans for the multi-billion-dollar expansion, the company cannot afford to build the new reactors.LiNeBrEaKSo far, the Department of Energy has only set aside enough money to guarantee loans for a few of the dozens of new nuclear reactors that power companies have proposed.

The Gazette (Cedar Rapids, Iowa)  	January 6, 2009 Tuesday 	Controversial Waterloo power plant cancelled  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	456 words  	Jan. 6--LS Power has pulled the plug on plans to build a $1. 3 billion coal-fired generating station in Waterloo.LiNeBrEaKThe company blamed "slowing load growth in the region due to the current downturn in the U.S. economy, and the fact that LS Power has more advanced projects under development in the region that could serve the same need." LiNeBrEaKThe project was opposed by county boards of health environmental groups concerned mainly about the plant's impact on regional air quality and the effect its carbon dioxide emissions could have on climate change. Those environmental issues probably played a large part in LS Power's plans to cancel the project, according to attorney Wally Taylor of Cedar Rapids, legal chair of the Sierra Club's Iowa Chapter.LiNeBrEaK"It's great news, and it foreshadows the economic problems that coal-burning plants are going to have," Taylor said.LiNeBrEaKTaylor said the plant faced a growing possibility of restrictions on its fine particulate emissions, restrictions that the company had hoped to avoid. He said the possibility that the plant could face carbon taxes or placed under a cap-and-trade system of regulating greenhouse gas emissions will also increase under the new federal administration taking office next month.LiNeBrEaKLS Power's Elk Run Energy Station differed from most other power plants operating in Iowa, in that it would not generate power for use by its owners. Rather, LS Power planned to sell its output to utilities or other major users.LiNeBrEaKThe project cancellation was announced just days after Dynegy Inc. announced it would not continue a coal-fired power plant development joint venture with LS Power.LiNeBrEaKThe Cedar Rapids-based public interest law center Plains Justice issued a statement congratulating LS Power and Dynegy for recognizing that developing new coal plants is "just too financially risky for their stockholders."LiNeBrEaKPlains Justice said a new Alliant Energy power plant planned for Marshalltown takes the same "imprudent financial risks."LiNeBrEaKThe boards of health in Johnson, Fayette and Black Hawk counties had passed resolutions opposing the plant for air quality reasons.LiNeBrEaKLS Power Assistant Vice President Mark Milburn expressed gratitude for the "unwavering support" of many individuals and businesses in the Cedar Valley area.LiNeBrEaKn Contact the writer: (319) 398-8317 or david.dewitte@gazcomm.com	ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (92%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (91%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (90%); POWER PLANTS (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (87%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (78%); COAL INDUSTRY (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (76%); CLIMATE CHANGE (76%); PUBLIC HEALTH and WELFARE LAW (76%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (76%); PARTICULATE MATTER (70%); LAWYERS (70%)  		IOWA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 7, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Gazette   	Dave DeWitte, The Gazette, Cedar Rapids, Iowa  	SIERRA CLUB (56%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	NAICS221210 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION (92%); NAICS221122 ELECTRIC POWER DISTRIBUTION (92%); NAICS211112 NATURAL GAS LIQUID EXTRACTION (92%); SIC1321 NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (92%); NAICS221111 HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (52%); SIC4931 ELECTRIC and OTHER SERVICES COMBINED (52%); SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES (92%) General  	20090106-CR-Controversial-Waterloo-power-plant-cancelled-0106  	CR  	DYN (NYSE) (92%); LNT (NYSE) (52%) NYSE:DYN, NYSE:LNT  	DYNEGY INC (92%); MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (61%); ALLIANT ENERGY CORP (52%)  												
The Houston Chronicle (Texas)  	January 6, 2009 Tuesday 	Efficient business: City's chief 'green' official blends his background in electrical engineering with his drive to save money and solve problems  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1126 words  	Jan. 6--The city's chief officer of sustainable growth is far from your stereotypical "green" activist. Cris Eugster does not belong to the Sierra Club or the Audubon Society. He has no background in environmental science or policy or politics. He is a clean-cut electrical engineer who spent years as a McKinsey consultant, jetting around the world to advise corporate titans on technology, energy and waste logistics.LiNeBrEaKEugster isn't even sure he would call himself an environmentalist.LiNeBrEaK"I describe myself more as a problem solver," he said. LiNeBrEaKNevertheless, the 43-year-old seems a good match for Mayor Bill White's approach to environmental development. Like the mayor, Eugster brings a businessman's background to the job: The focus is on innovation, incentives and incremental victories.LiNeBrEaKWhen Eugster recounts how the city helped low-income residents install energy-saving insulation, he speaks about "performance metrics." If the topic is luring wind-energy companies to Houston, he describes "business value propositions."LiNeBrEaKIt takes a nerd ...LiNeBrEaKEugster is a bit of a nerd, he agrees. He reads the city's electric bill, looking for ways to cut it. He likes to analyze processes, pose questions: How much can the city save by screwing energy-saving bulbs into all its traffic lights? (About $10,000 a day.) What uses the most energy in the city? (Sewage treatment plants, where giant fans blow hot air over our excrement to dry it out.) How much does that cost? ($28 million every year in electric and gas bills.)LiNeBrEaK(For those who are not sewage experts, the excrement is dried to keep it out of the bayous, then dumped in landfills or turned into fertilizer.)LiNeBrEaK"The thing that excites me about sustainability is it's a complex problem with many variables," said Eugster, who did his undergraduate work at Texas AandM University.LiNeBrEaKEugster's approach sometimes is called eco-efficiency, said Joseph Romm, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. It emerged in the 1990s with the realization that many environmental actions also save dollars.LiNeBrEaK"Most of those things had to do with using energy and materials more efficiently," Romm said. But the market-based approach will not solve all environmental problems, he added. Issues such as toxic waste, water quality and global warming also need government regulation, enforcement and infrastructure investment.LiNeBrEaKWhite created the position for the city, and looked for someone like Eugster to fill it.LiNeBrEaK"We needed somebody with business experience to run numbers and distinguish between ideas that were green but not economical, and things that could also save us money," he said. "I'm a big believer in the environment, but for the decades I've worked on sustainable development, I've often seen ideas that sounded good in theory but had a very low return on investment."LiNeBrEaKWooing foreign investmentLiNeBrEaKEugster, who has a doctorate in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also has the scientific background to understand the technology behind building codes and wind power purchasing, White explained.LiNeBrEaKEugster doesn't just parse kilowatts. He also is an economic diplomat for Houston. He recently returned from a trip to China, where he visited solar-panel factories and manufacturers of oil pipelines. It was the first step in possibly wooing Chinese companies to set up facilities in Houston.LiNeBrEaKEugster also worked with other city leaders to persuade a Danish company, Vestas Wind Systems, to pick Houston for its first U.S. research and development facility. Originally, Vestas was considering Austin and other cities -- with Houston running a distant fourth. The owners worried Houston, with its "old energy" image, would hurt their green "brand."LiNeBrEaKBut Eugster and other civic leaders went on a marketing blitz.LiNeBrEaK"We convinced them Houston is the energy capital of the world," Eugster said. "This is a place to do business, to get things done, and a lot of their potential clients and customers are here. Shell is building huge wind farms."LiNeBrEaKVestas decided on Houston in June and plans to open the RandD center in 2009.LiNeBrEaKEugster said he wants to lure more new energy companies here.LiNeBrEaKTo back up his rhetoric, he ticks off some of Houston's real "green" accomplishments: locking in a wind-power contract that made the city the No. 1 municipal purchaser of renewable power, or snagging a "Solar America City" grant from the Department of Energy.LiNeBrEaKMore important than the DOE recognition was what came next. Eugster used the grant as a lure to corral private-sector partners, leveraging the initial $400,000 award to get an additional $1. 15 million in private funds.LiNeBrEaKThe money will go toward solar panels on the roof of the George R. Brown Convention Center and the creation of a solar "farm," perhaps on the site of the old Sunnyside landfill.LiNeBrEaKSaving the taxpayers' cashLiNeBrEaKThe total cost to the local taxpayer is zero, if you don't count Eugster's time. It's typical of Eugster's -- and White's -- green strategy: create public-private partnerships, and concentrate on changes that will save the taxpayers money.LiNeBrEaKThat explains the city's recent focus on recycling tree and yard waste, rather than radically ramping up "curbside" pickup of consumer recyclables such as plastics and paper.LiNeBrEaKWhile the traditional curbside program only reaches half of the city's households and has struggled with participation rates, the new "tree waste" program will reach everyone.LiNeBrEaK"Green waste is a no brainer," Eugster said. The tree limbs, branches and stumps constitute 12 percent of all the city's solid waste.LiNeBrEaKStarting in January, tree waste will be picked up every other month on traditional "heavy trash" days. Recycling the tree waste could save the city $1. 5 million per year.LiNeBrEaKEugster will have one more year under White's administration to work on energy efficiency and other green initiatives.LiNeBrEaKHe will spend some of that time tackling decidedly unsexy subjects, such as lowering electricity consumption at those raw sewage treatment plants. He is exploring the idea of using jet engine turbines to dry the excrement. The spinning turbines create electricity to help power the plant, while the waste exhaust from the jets does the drying work.LiNeBrEaK"I'm a technology guy from both my background and my passion," he said. "And I think we can solve a lot of problems with technology and innovation."LiNeBrEaKcarolyn.feibel@chron.com	ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (90%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (90%); ENGINEERING (90%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); SEWERAGE SYSTEMS (87%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (78%); CITY LIFE (78%); WIND ENERGY (78%); ENERGY REGULATION (77%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (77%); CONSULTING SERVICES (76%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (74%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (72%); HAZARDOUS WASTE (71%); TOXIC and HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES (65%); FERTILIZERS (62%); LANDFILLS (51%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%); LOW INCOME PERSONS (53%)  		HOUSTON, TX, USA (79%) TEXAS, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (79%)  	January 8, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Houston Chronicle   	Carolyn Feibel, Houston Chronicle  	NATIONAL AUDUBON SOCIETY (84%); SIERRA CLUB (84%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	Agriculture/Food  	20090106-HO-Efficient-business-0106  	HO  	OTC-PINK:VWSYF  	MCKINSEY and CO (72%)

But the market-based approach will not solve all environmental problems, he added. Issues such as toxic waste, water quality and global warming also need government regulation, enforcement and infrastructure investment.LiNeBrEaKWhite created the position for the city, and looked for someone like Eugster to fill it.LiNeBrEaK"We needed somebody with business experience to run numbers and distinguish between ideas that were green but not economical, and things that could also save us money," he said. "I'm a big believer in the environment, but for the decades I've worked on sustainable development, I've often seen ideas that sounded good in theory but had a very low return on investment."LiNeBrEaKWooing foreign investmentLiNeBrEaKEugster, who has a doctorate in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also has the scientific background to understand the technology behind building codes and wind power purchasing, White explained.LiNeBrEaKEugster doesn't just parse kilowatts. He also is an economic diplomat for Houston. He recently returned from a trip to China, where he visited solar-panel factories and manufacturers of oil pipelines. It was the first step in possibly wooing Chinese companies to set up facilities in Houston.LiNeBrEaKEugster also worked with other city leaders to persuade a Danish company, Vestas Wind Systems, to pick Houston for its first U.S. research and development facility. Originally, Vestas was considering Austin and other cities - with Houston running a distant fourth. The owners worried Houston, with its "old energy" image, would hurt their green "brand."LiNeBrEaKBut Eugster and other civic leaders went on a marketing blitz.LiNeBrEaK"We convinced them Houston is the energy capital of the world," Eugster said. "This is a place to do business, to get things done, and a lot of their potential clients and customers are here. Shell is building huge wind farms."LiNeBrEaKVestas decided on Houston in June and plans to open the RandD center in 2009.LiNeBrEaKEugster said he wants to lure more new energy companies here.LiNeBrEaKTo back up his rhetoric, he ticks off some of Houston's real "green" accomplishments: locking in a wind-power contract that made the city the No. 1 municipal purchaser of renewable power, or snagging a "Solar America City" grant from the Department of Energy.LiNeBrEaKMore important than the DOE recognition was what came next. Eugster used the grant as a lure to corral private-sector partners, leveraging the initial $400,000 award to get an additional $1. 15 million in private funds.LiNeBrEaKThe money will go toward solar panels on the roof of the George R. Brown Convention Center and the creation of a solar "farm," perhaps on the site of the old Sunnyside landfill.LiNeBrEaKSaving the taxpayers' cashLiNeBrEaKThe total cost to the local taxpayer is zero, if you don't count Eugster's time. It's typical of Eugster's - and White's - green strategy: create public-private partnerships, and concentrate on changes that will save the taxpayers money.LiNeBrEaKThat explains the city's recent focus on recycling tree and yard waste, rather than radically ramping up "curbside" pickup of consumer recyclables such as plastics and paper.LiNeBrEaKWhile the traditional curbside program only reaches half of the city's households and has struggled with participation rates, the new "tree waste" program will reach everyone.LiNeBrEaK"Green waste is a no brainer," Eugster said. The tree limbs, branches and stumps constitute 12 percent of all the city's solid waste.LiNeBrEaKStarting in January, tree waste will be picked up every other month on traditional "heavy trash" days. Recycling the tree waste could save the city $1. 5 million per year.LiNeBrEaKEugster will have one more year under White's administration to work on energy efficiency and other green initiatives.LiNeBrEaKHe will spend some of that time tackling decidedly unsexy subjects, such as lowering electricity consumption at those raw sewage treatment plants. He is exploring the idea of using jet engine turbines to dry the excrement. The spinning turbines create electricity to help power the plant, while the waste exhaust from the jets does the drying work.LiNeBrEaK"I'm a technology guy from both my background and my passion," he said. "And I think we can solve a lot of problems with technology and innovation."

Kyodo News International (Tokyo, Japan)  	January 6, 2009 Tuesday 	Westinghouse wins deal to build 2 nuclear reactors in Florida  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	223 words  	Jan. 6--TOKYO -- Toshiba Corp. said Tuesday its U.S. nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric Co. and U.S. engineering firm Shaw Group Inc. have won a deal to build two nuclear reactors in Florida. LiNeBrEaKThey will construct the AP1000 reactors for Progress Energy Florida, a subsidiary of U.S. power utility firm Progress Energy, Toshiba said. The first of the reactors is planned to start operation in 2016 and the second in 2017.LiNeBrEaKThis is the third such deal in the United States for Westinghouse since 2008. It won similar deals last spring to build two nuclear reactors each for Southern Co.'s Georgia Power and South Carolina Electric and Gas Co., a subsidiary of SCANA Corp.LiNeBrEaKToshiba said nuclear plant construction and refurbishment demand is on the rise to provide a stable supply of electricity and prevent global warming.LiNeBrEaKToshiba and Westinghouse will accelerate efforts to meet such market needs through aggressive business activities, Toshiba said.

The New York Times 	January 6, 2009 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	Bush to Protect Vast New Pacific Tracts  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 13  	537 words  	President Bush will designate vast tracts of American-controlled Pacific Ocean islands, reefs, surface waters and sea floor as marine national monuments on Tuesday, limiting fishing, mining, oil exploration or other commercial activity, White House officials said Monday.  LiNeBrEaK  The protected zones, including parts of the deep Mariana Trench and a string of largely uninhabited reefs and atolls near the Equator and American Samoa, include a total of 195,280 square miles, an area larger than the states of Washington and Oregon combined.LiNeBrEaK  The islands, atolls, reefs and underwater mountain ranges offer unique habitat to hundreds of rare species of birds and fish. Among them are tropicbirds, boobies, frigate birds, terns, noddies, petrels, shearwaters and albatrosses, according to environmental groups who pushed for the protection. It is also the habitat of the rare Micronesian megapode, a bird that  incubates its eggs using subterranean volcanic heat. LiNeBrEaK  The president's action, which requires no Congressional or other approval, builds on the designation two years ago of the 139,000-square-mile Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in the northwest Hawaiian Islands under the federal Antiquities Act. LiNeBrEaK  Dana Perino, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Bush's action would preserve huge ocean areas for future generations and would not conflict with military activities or freedom of navigation. LiNeBrEaK  ''With the designation of the world's largest marine reserve in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands in 2006, and now these three other sites, George W. Bush has done more to protect unique areas of the world's oceans than any other person in history,'' said Joshua Reichert, managing director of the Pew Environmental Group.LiNeBrEaK  The declaration came after two years of study and relatively modest opposition from commercial and recreational fishing groups and some officials in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, who feared it would throttle future economic development.LiNeBrEaK  The Central Pacific islands and atolls are known as the Line Islands, extending nearly 2,000 miles and including Johnston Atoll; Howard, Baker and Jarvis Islands; Kingman Reef; Wake Island; and Rose Atoll. They are remote and largely uninhabited. Most became American territory under the Guano Islands Act of 1856, which allowed sea captains to claim islands that were rich in guano -- bird and bat droppings -- which were used to make fertilizer and gunpowder. LiNeBrEaK  In the western Pacific Ocean, the declaration includes the marine waters around the Northern Marianas, including the Mariana Trench, the deepest canyon in the world.LiNeBrEaK  Some officials of the Marianas complained to the White House that protecting the islands and waters would limit economic opportunity for islanders and strip them of their authority to regulate their resources. But others welcomed the decision.LiNeBrEaK  Diane Regas of the Environmental Defense Fund said the designation had both short-term ecological benefits and a longer-term favorable impact on global warming.LiNeBrEaK  ''If we can keep that area untouched,'' Ms. Regas said, ''it will provide an unparalleled scientific resource and a huge investment in improving the planet's resilience to climate change.''

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	January 6, 2009 Tuesday   All Editions	NBA still bouncing right along  	SPORTS; FOR THE RECORD; Pg. S02  	327 words  	Let squawk-radio fulfill its destiny to further global warming by gabbing Giants-Eagles to death.LiNeBrEaKTime for another look at some of what's going on as the NBA approaches the halfway mark: LiNeBrEaK* No coach has been fired since Reggie Theus became No. 6 this season on Dec. 15, but keep an eye on Chicago's Vinny Del Negro.LiNeBrEaKHe further wounded an already deteriorating chemistry by fining five players for eating in the locker room (fast-food joints near arenas might go under without the NBA).LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, his team looks clueless on the floor, exposing his inexperience.LiNeBrEaKGM John Paxson also could eventually take a fall for the surprising hire and building a mismatched roster he could blow up by the Feb. 19 trade deadline.LiNeBrEaK* Yet, firing Del Negro might not help, considering how this season's replacements have fared entering Monday's play (fired coaches' record in parentheses): Washington's Ed Tapscott, 6-15 (1-10); Oklahoma City's Scott Brooks, 3-13 (1-12); Toronto's Jay Triano, 6-11 (8-9); Minnesota's Kevin McHale, 4-10 (4-15); Sacramento's Kenny Natt, 2-8 (6-18); and Philadelphia's Tony DiLeo, 4-6 (9-14).LiNeBrEaK* Anyone who's watched Adam Morrison in Charlotte this season might mistake him as a cross between the Addams Family's Lurch and Quasimodo: a robotic hunchback.LiNeBrEaKThe third overall pick in 2006 should soon join 2001 top pick (for Washington) Kwame Brown, plus one-year coaching busts Leonard Hamilton (Wizards) and Sam Vincent (Bobcats) as examples of Michael Jordan's executive ineptitude.LiNeBrEaK* Speaking of third-overall busts, Darius Miles (picked in 2000) played the final 1: 46 Sunday for Memphis after missing two-plus seasons with what Portland thought was a career-ending knee injury.LiNeBrEaKThus, the Blazers take $9 million salary-cap hits this and next season, voiding a successful injury appeal that took him off their books.LiNeBrEaK* Shaquille O'Neal might not be done yet as at almost 37; he's averaged 21. 9 points and 10. 4 boards as Phoenix has won five of its past seven.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 6, 2009 Tuesday 	Obama embraces Arnold's greenhouse standards  	NEWS  	744 words  	Just in case anyone still wondered, President-elect Barack Obama has now made it plain he is a greenhouse gas believer. He gave no truck during his campaign to skeptics' frequent claims that climate change has nothing to do with human activity and it's now certain he won't as president.LiNeBrEaKIt is also evident that one of his first orders of business will be to establish a federal greenhouse gas-reduction plan that looks a lot like what California is devising under the mandate of the 2006 measure known as AB32. That's the landmark California law requiring cars and stationary pollution sources to cut their overall carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels over the next 12 years. LiNeBrEaKCalifornia has been frustrated for more than a year in this department because George W. Bush's administration refused to give a go-ahead for the state to adopt strict vehicle emission rules as part of that effort. Under the previous six presidents, green lights for smog-cutting measures tougher than federal standards had always been automatic.LiNeBrEaKAt Bush's behest, the federal Environmental Protection Agency maintained that granting the state a go-ahead like those received for every other anti-pollution advance of the last 37 years would interfere with federal plans to adopt national rules, creating confusion for auto makers.LiNeBrEaKOf course, there are no such federal plans. Nor would there have been any interference with plans if they did exist. For 16 other states now automatically adopt any new California clean-air standard within four years after it's passed here. Those states, together with California, account for more than half the vehicle sales in America   which in practicality means the moment California gets a green light, carmakers must get ready to sell California-qualified cars elsewhere, too.LiNeBrEaKBut the Bush administration claptrap will not last much longer. Obama made that clear in a strongly worded video played the other day as part of the opening ceremony of an international climate change conference hosted by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.LiNeBrEaK"Too often, Washington has failed to show leadership (on greenhouse gas reductions)," Obama said. "That will change when I take office. My presidency will mark a new chapter in America's leadership on climate change that will strengthen our security and create millions of new jobs in the process"... We'll establish strong annual targets that set us on a course to reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020 and reduce them by an additional 80 percent by 2050."LiNeBrEaKHe was, therefore, adopting the precise goals of AB32, written by then-Assemblywoman, now state senator-elect Fran Pavley of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, and later signed by Schwarzenegger after he negotiated some changes to soften it.LiNeBrEaKIf there was any doubt one of his first acts as president will be to grant the delayed California waiver, Obama removed it by saying:LiNeBrEaK"I promise you this. Once I am president, any governor who is willing to promote clean energy will have a partner in the White House." That could have been a description of Schwarzenegger.LiNeBrEaKIn short, Obama was announcing one change he will bring in his first days in office.LiNeBrEaKFor Schwarzenegger, this means he's lost his mantle as America's loudest and most visible governmental advocate in the global warming fight. But it will also mean that many goals he's pursued will come to fruition, or at least a start in that direction.LiNeBrEaKSo there was satisfaction in his voice when Schwarzenegger said, "That is staggering. This is so huge. That's really big, because now we as a nation can lead, like we do in other things. Now we can inspire other nations"..."LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger, entering his last two years as governor, plainly wants to be remembered for the climate change fight as much as for any other thing he's done. "Let me tell you," he said, "when I signed the nation's first law to cap greenhouse gas emissions, California was leading a revolution, but without any soldiers"... Our revolution now has soldiers and it's spreading around the globe and I'm very happy about that."LiNeBrEaKIn effect, Schwarzenegger was passing a leadership torch to Obama, after years of carrying it through a dark time. And Obama indicated in strong language that he's ready to accept the relay handoff and run with it   another striking example of California pioneering a national and international trend.LiNeBrEaKThomas D.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 6, 2009 Tuesday 	Opinion: Social equity needs attention in energy policy  	NEWS; Opinion  	660 words  	"The time for delay is over," President-elect Barack Obama said recently following a meeting about energy and climate policy with former Vice President Al Gore and Vice President-elect Joe Biden. "We have the opportunity now to create jobs all across this country in all 50 states to repower America, to redesign how we use energy and think about how we are increasing efficiency to make our economy stronger."LiNeBrEaKTo that end, the incoming administration has announced plans to fund capital projects like mass transit, electrical grids, sewer systems and public utilities. It will invest in jobs to design alternative fuels, build windmills and solar panels, and install fuel-efficient heating and cooling systems. LiNeBrEaKWe need such efforts urgently. Yet if past is prologue, there is a great deal of work to be done to ensure that the federal government carefully weighs the distribution of its investments. Who will benefit, who will not? Who may be harmed inadvertently?LiNeBrEaKIn recent history, federal investment in infrastructure and economic transition has overlooked (or directly harmed) particular groups of Americans. New roads and highways led to mass displacement of minority, elderly and low-income households; water and wastewater systems bypassed many communities of color; post-Katrina reconstruction aid widely failed to reach immigrant workers in the Gulf states; and so on.LiNeBrEaKLurking in the energy and climate-change agenda are similar risks. Here are key equity concerns that need a place in our dialogue:LiNeBrEaKRenewable-energy transmission: Aggressive construction of renewable energy facilities will require broad expansion of the electric grid to reach isolated places where large wind farms and solar plants can be built. New electrical transmission lines will create visual intrusions and potential health risks.LiNeBrEaKCap-and-trade programs: The widely favored method for reducing carbon emissions is to set limits, but allow polluters to buy and sell emissions credits. This system offers many advantages, but it will permit continued operation of some highly polluting facilities that harm those living and working nearby.LiNeBrEaKUtility costs: As climate conditions change, the costs of electricity, natural gas and fuel oil will rise. At the same time, regulators favor electricity pricing that will increase costs during peak periods. Lower-income households will be least able to afford the technology needed to reduce energy consumption and avoid peak periods.LiNeBrEaKEnergy efficiency in rental markets: Government programs will provide rebates and tax incentives to encourage energy efficiency. In the residential rental market   which consumes at least 40 percent of residential energy   this presents a major challenge. Owners have little incentive to lower energy consumption in rental units, and tenants have little incentive to invest in efficiency improvements.LiNeBrEaKMetropolitan infrastructure: America's roads, bridges and water systems are in dire need of rehabilitation. Yet such projects inevitably come with winners and losers. They increase home values and quality of life in some communities while risking condemnation, displacement and environmental impacts in others.LiNeBrEaKAmerica's universities and think tanks have developed policy solutions to these challenges. The administration needs to tap this expertise.LiNeBrEaKAs Obama has said, energy and climate security is "not only a problem, it is also an opportunity." His administration has an opportunity   and a duty   to lead with policies that are as equitable as they are ambitious.LiNeBrEaKMichelle Wilde Anderson is an assistant professor at UC-Berkeley School of Law and an adviser to the Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Race, Ethnicity and Diversity.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	January 6, 2009 Tuesday   FINAL EDITION	AROUND THE GLOBE  	NEWS; Pg. 007  	1032 words  	Bush orders protectionsLiNeBrEaKfor Pacific island chainsLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON - Parts of three remote and uninhabited Pacific island chains are being set aside by President Bush as national monuments to protect them from oil and gas extraction and commercial fishing in what will be the largest marine conservation effort in history.LiNeBrEaKThe three areas - totaling some 195,280 square miles - include the Mariana Trench, and the waters and corals surrounding three uninhabited islands in the Northern Mariana Islands, Rose Atoll in American Samoa and seven islands strung along the equator in the central Pacific Ocean. LiNeBrEaKEach location harbors unique species and some of the rarest geological formations on Earth - from the world's largest land crab to a bird that incubates its eggs in the heat of underwater volcanoes.LiNeBrEaKThe move is a boost to the environmental record of a president who has been accused of not doing enough against air pollution and global warming. He also lifted a moratorium on oil and gas drilling off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.LiNeBrEaKIt will be up to President-elect Barack Obama to hammer out how the areas will be managed, and to make sure the prohibitions are enforced.LiNeBrEaKFrench boat is hijackedLiNeBrEaKand crew taken hostageLiNeBrEaKPARIS - Pirates hijacked a French boat and took its nine crew members hostage in the latest attack in some of the world's most dangerous waters off oil-rich southern Nigeria, the boat's owner said yesterday.LiNeBrEaKThe captain of the Bourbon Leda was able to speak with the boat's owners Sunday and said all nine crew members were unharmed, according to a statement by the company, Bourbon, which provides specialist boats for the oil and gas industry. It said in the statement yesterday that it was working to free the crew.LiNeBrEaKPiracy is rampant in the waters off Nigeria, with attacks and hostage-taking linked to militants pressing the Nigerian government to send more oil proceeds to the region.LiNeBrEaKThe pirate attacks have been increasing, particularly off the coast of Somalia. A French navy vessel thwarted two attacks Sunday by heavily armed Somali pirates on cargo ships in the dangerous Gulf of Aden and captured 19 of them.LiNeBrEaKIn 2008, pirates attacked 111 ships in the Gulf of Aden, hijacking 42 of them, and receiving tens of millions of dollars in ransoms.LiNeBrEaKJudge extends deadlineLiNeBrEaKfor governor's indictmentLiNeBrEaKCHICAGO - Federal prosecutors have been granted an extra three months to seek an indictment of Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich.LiNeBrEaKU.S. Chief District Court Judge James Holderman entered an order allowing the indictment deadline to be extended from Jan. 7 to April 7, according to the court docket in the Blagojevich case. Prosecutors had asked last week for the extension, citing the complexity of their investigation of pay-to-play politics in the Blagojevich administration.LiNeBrEaKThe government charged Blagojevich in a criminal complaint, citing the need for speed to keep him from allegedly making a deal to sell to the highest bidder his appointment to the U.S. Senate seat vacated by President-elect Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKBut it must seek a formal indictment because defendants cannot be tried on criminal complaints.LiNeBrEaKPrized bluefin tuna netsLiNeBrEaKa premium price in TokyoLiNeBrEaKTOKYO - Two sushi bar owners paid more than $100,000 for a Japanese bluefin tuna at a Tokyo fish auction yesterday, several times the average price and the highest in nearly a decade, market officials said.LiNeBrEaKThe 282-pound premium tuna caught off the northern coast of Oma fetched $104,700, or 9. 63 million yen, the highest since 2001, when another Japanese bluefin tuna brought an all-time record of 20 million yen, market official Takashi Yoshida said.LiNeBrEaKYoshida said the extravagant purchase - about $370 per pound - went to a Hong Kong sushi bar owner and his Japanese competitor who reached a peaceful settlement to share the big fish. The Hong Kong buyer also paid the highest price at last year's new year event at Tokyo's Tsukiji market, the world's largest fish seller, which holds near-daily auctions.LiNeBrEaKA slightly bigger imported bluefin caught off the eastern United States sold for $15,400 in yesterday's auction.LiNeBrEaKTypical tuna prices at Tokyo fish markets are less than $25 per pound. But bluefin tuna is considered by gourmets to be the best, and when sliced up into small pieces and served on rice in restaurants, it goes for very high prices.LiNeBrEaKTheft of six tombstonesLiNeBrEaKpuzzles police in N.Y.LiNeBrEaKCOLONIE, N.Y. - Police are puzzling over what would motivate a father and son to haul off six tombstones from a monument company in suburban Albany.LiNeBrEaKTown of Colonie Detective Lt.

The Washington Times 	January 6, 2009 Tuesday 		NATION; INSIDE POLITICS; A06  	1084 words  	Picking KaineLiNeBrEaK"Expectations that Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine will be installed as chairman of the Democratic National Committee by President-elect Barack Obama suggest strongly that the party headquarters will continue the move by outgoing Chairman Howard Dean to expand the party beyond its old 18-state model," Paul Bedard writes in the Washington Whispers column at www.usnews.com.LiNeBrEaK"Party officials say Obama's pick of Kaine indicates that the new president both wants to reward and recognize support from traditionally GOP states like Kaine's Virginia and to expand the party's march into Republican territory. Kaine backed Obama very early in the Democratic primaries and helped to turn the home of the Confederacy into a Democratic state that backed Obama in the general election," Mr. Bedard observed.LiNeBrEaK"The officials said that Kaine would be the second party chairman to move away from the old, urban-state-based approach of sustaining support in 18 key states to a more expansive approach that is likely to include outreach in Southern states and traditional Republican strongholds like Texas. LiNeBrEaK"One official said that like Obama and Dean, Kaine understands the value in toning down the harsh partisan rhetoric while reaching out to new voters. Dean's move was controversial four years ago, but now even his critics give him credit for rebuilding the party in all 50 states, a move that the Obama campaign was able to piggyback off in its 2008 victory."LiNeBrEaKRelaxed BushLiNeBrEaK"Bush's critics - and especially the left-wing haters - are going to be disappointed when they see his demeanor as he leaves his eight-year presidency," the Weekly Standard's Fred Barnes writes, describing a recent lunch he and William Kristol had with the president.LiNeBrEaK"In our conversation, he wasn't bitter or downcast or pessimistic, nor was he boastful or disdainful. He appears comfortable with what he expects his legacy will be, including a battle against Islamist terrorists that [will] endure under President [-elect] Obama," Mr. Barnes said.LiNeBrEaK"In recent weeks, Bush has been interviewed more than a dozen times about his years in the White House, though not by either the New York Times or The Washington Post. And there are more interviews to come, including several with Texas reporters and one this week with Brit Hume of Fox News Channel.LiNeBrEaK"During our conversation, Bush occasionally spoke off the record and several times 'really' off the record. He talked lightheartedly about being surprised when lectured on global warming at his first meeting with European Union leaders. He wasn't persuaded to change his view. Now the new EU president, Czech Republic President Vaclav Klaus, is a global warming skeptic.LiNeBrEaK"On the Middle East, Bush said the key moment in his becoming strongly pro-Israel - unlike his father, President George H.W. Bush - was a visit in 1998 just after he'd been re-elected governor of Texas. Ariel Sharon, then Israeli settlements minister, flew him by helicopter over Israel and the West Bank. He saw firsthand, Bush says, how vulnerable Israel, a democratic ally, is to attack."LiNeBrEaKMaking historyLiNeBrEaK"So, this is Change We Can Believe In?" the New York Post's Charles Hurt writes.LiNeBrEaK"It's more like the same old change we've heard jingling in the pockets of politicians since the beginning of time. And it's the same dirty change that has landed the bums in jail since the beginning of democracy," Mr. Hurt said.LiNeBrEaK"Barack Obama hasn't even made history yet by getting into the White House, but he's already making history for the number of serious scandals between his election and his inauguration.LiNeBrEaK"First, it was Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, Obama's old pal and political ally. Now New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson - Obama's pick for commerce secretary - bails out amid a grand jury investigation into how a major political donor snared a lucrative contract from the state.LiNeBrEaK"At this rate, Obama will be lucky to have any friends left after his first 100 days in office.LiNeBrEaK"And what about all the grand promises Obama made after his election about meticulously fly-specking every one of the people he plans to put in his administration to avoid improprieties or even the appearance of them?LiNeBrEaK"They vetted Richardson and didn't smell this little federal investigation?LiNeBrEaK"So let's just put him in charge of the nation's economy. That's not a very important position.LiNeBrEaK"Obama ran for president and won handily on the promise that he is a new kind of politician, carrying a voice directly from the people. And he promised an open and honest government. People gave Obama the benefit of the doubt and decided not to hang the words and deeds of others on him.LiNeBrEaK"But at some point, it all becomes much more serious. It becomes the grave issue of judgment and knowing whom you can trust. Obama has allowed himself to be surrounded by some seriously flawed people.LiNeBrEaK"If you are known by the company that you keep, then Obama needs to find him some new friends."LiNeBrEaKShe's backLiNeBrEaK"Ann Coulter is at it again," Myrna Blyth writes at www.wowowow .com.LiNeBrEaK" 'Guilty: Liberal " Victim " and Their Assault on America' (Crown Forum), the newest book from the leggy, blonde, irritatingly slender liberal-basher hits bookstores this week and is already climbing Amazon's bestseller list. And so the usual media Ann-a-rama has begun with Coulter launching the book on her pal Sean Hannity's radio and TV shows. She'll be on 'Today' on Tuesday and will follow that with countless interviews," the writer said.LiNeBrEaK"I talked to Coulter about 'Guilty' as she was about to embark on her media tour. The book is (no surprise) another in her attacks against liberals. Her thesis this time is that liberals always act like they are being victimized, primarily by the Republican Attack Machine. While in fact, they, with the help of a very biased media, tend to victimize all who disagree with them.LiNeBrEaK"She has written about media bias before. 'I really didn't intend to make the book so much about the media,' she told me, 'but I just couldn't help it because the media has so much power. They like to act as if they are powerless, but everything today is about the media. I just had to point out all their dirty little tricks. If you are Paul Revere you have to sound the alarm.'LiNeBrEaKMiss Coulter, in the interview, was a little softer in describing the president-elect: "Judging by his Cabinet choices, Obama may not be as crazy as I thought he was. That may be worse for my career but better for the country."

The Washington Post 	January 6, 2009 Tuesday   Regional Edition	A Monumental Decision;  George W. Bush becomes the conservation president, at least at sea. 	EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A12  	377 words  	YES, YOU READ that right. A man whose administration doesn't exactly have a green seal of approval from environmentalists will grant monument status today to three vast and breathtaking areas teeming with marine life in the South Pacific. Combined with other designations over the past eight years, including the creation of a 138,000-square-mile marine national monument in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands two years ago, Mr. Bush has now protected more ocean habitat (333,000 square miles) than any of his predecessors. LiNeBrEaKMr. Bush is using the American Antiquities Act to protect more than 195,000 square miles of marine habitat. This 1906 law gives the president the power to designate as national monuments any landmarks and other structures with historic or scientific value. Because Mr. Bush chose this route, as he did two years ago with the Hawaii designation, his action takes effect immediately, without a lengthy bureaucratic review under the federal marine sanctuaries law.LiNeBrEaKThe Mariana Trench Marine National Monument includes 21 active underwater volcanoes, geothermal vents and the Mariana Trench. James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, noted during a media call yesterday that the trench is five times longer than the Grand Canyon and deeper, at its deepest point, than Mount Everest is tall. The Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument encompasses five widely dispersed  reefs, atolls and islands that are home to seabirds, migratory birds, turtles and an abundance of predatory fish, such as sharks. And, according to Mr. Connaughton, the Rose Atoll Marine National Monument in American Samoa boasts "some of the broadest extent of live coral cover on the Earth."LiNeBrEaKThe ecosystems and geological formations that will now be protected from exploitation or disturbance will preserve the environment and some species that are disappearing in other parts of the world. Equally important, the national monuments will provide a platform for scientific discovery, particularly as the impact of climate change on the oceans becomes more apparent. "These locations are truly among the last pristine environments on Earth," Mr. Connaughton said. And thanks to Mr. Bush's action today, they will remain that way.

The Washington Post 	January 6, 2009 Tuesday   Met 2 Edition	Bush to Protect Three Areas in Pacific;  Marine Monuments Burnish an Environmental Record That Is Seen as Mixed 	A-SECTION; Pg. A01  	1094 words  	President Bush will create three new marine national monuments in the Pacific Ocean today, according to his top aides, a move that will help preserve sprawling sea and island ecosystems and cement the one aspect of his legacy that has won praise, sometimes grudgingly, from many environmentalists.LiNeBrEaKBush's decision to safeguard far-flung areas totaling 195,280 square miles, which comes just two weeks before he leaves office, underscores his contradictory environmental record. While he has resisted imposing mandatory curbs on greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change and has opened large areas of the nation to drilling, mining and other use of resources, by the end of his term he will have protected more ocean than any person in history. LiNeBrEaKInvoking powers of the Antiquities Act of 1906 that are used to protect statues and cultural sites, Bush will sharply restrict oil and gas exploration and commercial fishing around numerous remote islands in the central and western Pacific that have long been U.S. possessions. Scientists identified them as biologically and geologically rich areas. The monuments, which together are equal in size to Spain, include regions teeming with sharks and other top marine predators, along with vibrant coral and hydrothermal vents.LiNeBrEaKJames L. Connaughton, who chairs the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said the new designations, coupled with Bush's 2006 decision to create the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and a handful of smaller designations, mean that Bush has matched the record of some of the nation's most conservation-minded presidents. Spanning an additional 138,000 square miles, the Hawaiian monument is one of the world's largest protected marine reserves.LiNeBrEaK"In the last eight years, we've been able to accomplish conservation in marine environments on par with what we've achieved on land over the past 100 years," Connaughton said in an interview.LiNeBrEaKIn making the decision, Bush overruled the objections of recreational fishing interests and Vice President Cheney, who argued that the restrictions would create a dangerous precedent. Recreational fishermen will be required to apply for permits to fish in the protected areas.LiNeBrEaKBush, a fisherman himself, has consistently demonstrated more of an interest in marine issues than in other environmental matters, even making ocean conservation the theme of last year's Easter Egg Roll. First lady Laura Bush, an avid bird-watcher, weighed in as well, soliciting input from outside scientists, asking for briefings on the proposed monument designations, and privately telling some participants in the process that she considers the monuments a key part of her husband's environmental legacy.LiNeBrEaKAmong the unique ecological treasures that will receive new protection are the giant coconut crab, the largest land-living arthropod; an endangered bird that incubates its eggs with volcanic heat; a boiling pool of liquid sulfur; and a 31-mile-wide active mud volcano.LiNeBrEaKJoshua S. Reichert, managing director of the Pew Environment Group, said Bush "has ushered in a new era of ocean conservation in the United States and the world at large" with his push to protect ecologically valuable marine areas.LiNeBrEaK"It has taken 137 years, since the creation of America's first national park in Yellowstone in 1872, to recognize that unique areas of the world's oceans deserve the same kind of protection as we have afforded similar places on land," Reichert said. "And none too soon."LiNeBrEaKBut Vikki Spruill, president and chief executive of the Ocean Conservancy, an advocacy group, cautioned that in light of Bush's other policies, it is too early to judge the impact of the new protections.LiNeBrEaK"On balance, when you compare this to little to no action on climate change and the lifting of the moratorium [on offshore oil drilling] that's been in place for 27 years, that begins to paint a different picture," she said. "This move, by itself, is a really positive move. The net gain is a question we will have to address years from now."LiNeBrEaKThe decision to protect some isolated islands along with the Mariana Trench, the deepest ocean canyon in the world, also represents a strategic shift by ocean conservationists, who have decided they are better off safeguarding some of the sea's most pristine regions than trying to curb fishing, drilling and other "extractive" activity everywhere.LiNeBrEaKDiane Regas, managing director of the Environmental Defense Fund's oceans program, said there is "an emerging realization" that some places need to be cordoned off while others "need to be managed so people can survive on the fish and enjoy fishing."LiNeBrEaKBut Michael Nussman, president of the American Sportfishing Association, decried the new policy, saying that it presumes recreational fishing is "an evil activity."LiNeBrEaK"If you're going to keep the public out of a public area, you need a darned good reason to do that," said Nussman, whose group represents manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers who supply the sport fishing industry. "We don't think they've met that 'darned good reason' test."LiNeBrEaKSome experts suggested that the administration should have imposed more stringent protections in the three marine monuments, which include Rose Atoll on American Samoa; seven islands that constitute the central Pacific's Line Islands; and a grouping that includes the three northernmost islands in the northern Marianas chain and the Mariana Trench.LiNeBrEaKEnric Sala, a National Geographic researcher who has conducted two expeditions to the Line Islands, questioned why the protections extend only 50 miles from shore, rather than the 200 miles over which the United States can claim exclusive economic jurisdiction, and why they do not encompass the water above the rim of the Mariana Trench.LiNeBrEaK"In the ocean, everything is connected," said Sala, noting that the sharks that inhabit the Line Islands feed on seabirds that travel hundreds of miles from shore in search of food for their chicks.LiNeBrEaKConnaughton said the administration had determined that going beyond 50 miles would not provide significant "scientific benefits for conservation" and that there was no scientific record demonstrating that the waters above the trench need to be protected.LiNeBrEaKStill, Sala welcomed protection for the regions, which he called "the instruction manual to understand how coral reefs function, and the baseline to understand what we've done in terms of destruction of the coral reef ecosystems. . . . For a president that's not very green, ironically, this is going to be his largest legacy."

The Washington Post 	January 6, 2009 Tuesday   Regional Edition	Obama's Chance For a Blue Legacy  	EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A13  	760 words  	Today, President Bush will begin for the ocean what President Theodore Roosevelt did when he created the National Park System. The administration is announcing plans to create a national monument that will protect 195,000 square nautical miles of the Pacific Ocean -- bigger than the size of California and almost 50 percent larger than all U.S. national parks combined. Sweeping areas of the ocean's most pristine treasures, including spectacular corals and the deepest canyon in the world, will be protected by law and given the chance to become stronger.LiNeBrEaKYet what is most significant about this move is the opportunity it creates for President-elect Barack Obama. LiNeBrEaKCovering 71 percent of the planet, the oceans are our life-support system. They provide most of the oxygen that we breathe and much of the food that we eat. As the engine that drives our climate, the oceans are the front line of the global climate challenge, absorbing half of the carbon dioxide we've pumped into the  atmosphere and more excess heat from greenhouse gases than all the rain forests combined. Indeed, the oceans are the unsung hero in the climate change battle -- but  they are also the most vulnerable victims.LiNeBrEaKAnd while today's designation and protection represent major progress, there is still much to be done. The effects of climate change on the oceans are widespread; higher air and water temperatures alone have produced changes including the loss of sea ice, shifts in ocean circulation, rises in sea level, extreme weather events and harmful changes to fish and other marine wildlife. The increased concentration of carbon dioxide has led to acidification of ocean water, threatening the crucial base of the food web. The need to build ocean resilience is all the more critical since the 27-year moratorium on new oil and gas drilling offshore was lifted last year, threatening further harm to the marine environment while, ironically, doing little to resolve the nation's energy crisis.LiNeBrEaKWe at the Ocean Conservancy urge the Obama administration to build on President Bush's step forward by strengthening ocean protections that ensure the health of our planet. Obama could begin building a truly blue legacy with the following steps:LiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&middot; Mandate that every action on climate change include consideration of its impact on our oceans. The executive branch's No. 1 impediment in responding effectively to the impacts of climate change on the oceans is lack of authority and guidance. The president should direct his team to determine how best to manage for increased ocean resilience and adaptation to the effects of climate change and how to strengthen the needed science.LiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&middot; Focus on the Arctic. The Arctic, Earth's air conditioner, is already experiencing some of the most severe effects of climate change. Not only is sea ice  melting, but coastal communities have been dislocated. Despite the profound fragility of many marine ecosystems in the Arctic, the Bush administration has set out to open 77 million acres for oil and gas development -- exploration that will, ironically, increase greenhouse gas emissions that cause the melting. Any industrialization of the Arctic must be preceded by a comprehensive scientific assessment of the consequences of carrying out industrial activities. As the relevant Cabinet member, the interior secretary should immediately suspend any further planned lease sales and commence a multiagency public review and assessment of the Arctic, its peoples and its resources.LiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&middot; Bring order to the oceans. Like urban sprawl, we have marine and coastal sprawl, as the oceans today face a wealth of unprecedented activity. Wind farms and other energy facilities, commercial fishing, diverse recreational uses, offshore drilling and shipping superhighways are all competing to stake their claims. We urgently need a comprehensive plan for the oceans' many uses, in a way that sustains our oceans' resources. For example, in the production of seafood, the administration has the opportunity to ensure that commercial fishing and aquaculture are both pursued sustainably. As president, Obama should issue an executive order stating the national responsibility to manage America's waters for long-term ocean health and to make smart decisions for our shared ocean future.LiNeBrEaKThese initial actions, in addition to fulfilling Obama's promise to combat climate change, would set the stage for a blue presidential legacy -- one that Teddy Roosevelt would envy and  of which Obama could be proud.LiNeBrEaK The writer is president and chief executive of Ocean Conservancy.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 	January 5, 2009 Monday   Online Edition	Jay Bookman;  Why abandon the gasoline tax? 		683 words  	Monday, January 5, 2009, 12: 37 PMLiNeBrEaKThe state of Oregon is toying with the remarkably stupid idea of trying to tax people for transportation based on how many miles they drive. The idea is to use that new tax revenue to replace the traditional per-gallon gasoline tax, which taxes people based on how much gasoline they consume.LiNeBrEaK"A state task force will look at equipping every new vehicle in the state with a Global Positioning System tracking device to quietly record every mile driven and where.... The plan still requires legislative endorsement, and the full details could take several more years to work out, but state analysts said the governor's endorsement is a crucial step on a road many states are beginning to travel ---- ending dependence on the gasoline tax. LiNeBrEaK'This is a way to try to develop a fair funding mechanism that we're going to have to have if we're going to be aggressive in terms of looking at electric cars and hybrids and plug-ins and all those options, and at the same time continue to invest in our roads and infrastructure,' said Rem Nivens, the governor's deputy communications director."LiNeBrEaKAs the story suggests, the Oregon approach reflects a growing national disenchantment with the gasoline tax as a source of revenue. I've heard Georgia DOT Commissioner Gena Evans, for example, also speak favorably if theoretically about the idea of taxing by miles traveled instead of by gallons consumed. The fascination with tolls as a financing method for transportation is also motivated at least in part by that aversion to the gasoline tax.LiNeBrEaKBut that makes no sense to me. For one thing, collecting revenue through a gasoline tax requires very little infrastructure or government bureaucracy, and no inconvenience to the motorist. It is simple and straightforward. By contrast, collecting revenue through tolls or a massive GPS-monitoring system is far more intrusive, complicated and expensive. (Do we really need to attach GPS systems to our cars so government can track our every move? Does the concept of privacy have no meaning any more?)LiNeBrEaKSecond, the problem that Oregon is trying to address is that under the current gasoline tax, people who drive hybrids and other high-mileage vehicles will pay less in taxes than people who drive gas hogs. But that doesn't sound like a problem to be solved; quite the contrary, it sounds like a solution to be encouraged. LiNeBrEaKEnergy-wasting vehicles ought to be taxed higher, because they impose more external costs such as forcing us to import more oil and contribute more to air pollution and global warming. Using taxes to discourage energy inefficiency is a good idea, not a bad one.LiNeBrEaKNow, if all-electric cars ever become a major part of our transportation infrastructure, some kind of mileage-based tax might conceivably be necessary. But that's a long, long way into the future. I see no reason whatsoever to abandon the gasoline tax.LiNeBrEaKAs another writer recently put it:LiNeBrEaK".... the virtues of a gas tax remain what they have always been. A tax that suppresses U.S. gas consumption can have a major effect on reducing world oil prices. And the benefits of low world oil prices are obvious: They put tremendous pressure on OPEC, as evidenced by its disarray during the current collapse; they deal serious economic damage to energy-exporting geopolitical adversaries such as Russia, Venezuela, and Iran; and they reduce the enormous U.S. imbalance of oil trade which last year alone diverted a quarter of $1 trillion abroad Furthermore, a reduction in U.S. demand alters the balance of power between producer and consumer, making us less dependent on oil exporters. It begins weaning us off foreign oil, and, if combined with nuclear power and renewed U.S. oil and gas drilling, puts us on the road to energy independence."LiNeBrEaKThat writer is the conservative Charles Krauthammer, in the current issue of the conservative Weekly Standard, proposing a $1 increase in the federal gasoline tax with the revenue used to reduce federal payroll taxes.LiNeBrEaKhttp://www.ajc.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/ajc/bookman/entries/2009/01/05/the_state_of_oregon_has.html	FUEL TAX (92%); GASOLINE (90%); TAXES and TAXATION (90%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (89%); TRANSPORTATION SECTOR PERFORMANCE (78%); MOTOR VEHICLES (76%); GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (76%); ELECTRIC VEHICLES (76%); INFRASTRUCTURE (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (71%); AIR POLLUTION (50%) Blogs  		OREGON, USA (94%); GEORGIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 14, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspapers  	2009 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution   	JAY BOOKMAN; Staff  																					
Austin American-Statesman (Texas) 	January 5, 2009 Monday   Final Edition	Climate change gains head of steam  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A08  	531 words  	The collapse of the nation's financial markets, starting in September and still sending shock waves through the economy, and the presidential election pushed the issue of climate change off the nation's front burner. But the problem did not stop to await the election outcome or the economic bailouts. LiNeBrEaKIn fact, a new report from the U.S. Geological Survey says that previous estimates of how rapidly climate change may be occurring probably have been too conservative. In other words, it is happening faster than expected - and Texas might feel its effects in the form of drought sooner rather than later.LiNeBrEaKThe study was commissioned by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, which coordinates the work of 13 federal agencies.LiNeBrEaKThe fundamental question asked by the study was whether climate change will continue to occur at a relatively steady pace or if it might lurch forward. The answer is mixed, because there are different manifestations of climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe report concludes that rapid change in glaciers, ice sheets and thus sea level could occur in this century, and that the southwestern United States already might be beginning a period of severe drought. Already, the report says, climate studies of North America and the global subtropics indicate that "subtropical drying will likely intensify and persist in the future due to greenhouse warming.LiNeBrEaK"This drying is predicted to move northward into the southwestern United States. If the model results are correct, then the Southwestern United States may be beginning a period of increased drought," the report says.LiNeBrEaKThat's not to say our current drought is the direct product of global warming, though it could be, or has been made worse because of global warming. But the report gives no comfort to those who think that any truly noticeable climate change - what the government report calls "abrupt change" - is centuries away. Decades is more like it .LiNeBrEaKThis is not a report that tries to blame everything on man-made global warming. It notes, for example, that North America underwent some extreme "megadroughts" between the years 900 and 1600.LiNeBrEaKNor is it a fear-mongering study. It concludes that there probably won't be a massive release of methane from the seabed, which could considerably worsen global warming, nor that the Atlantic Ocean circulation system will suddenly shut down.LiNeBrEaKBut it does conclude that sea levels could rise by 4 feet by 2100 - versus the 1. 5 feet predicted by a United Nations panel on climate change. That's a warning that ought to be taken seriously now - especially along the Texas coast.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, it appears Texas government will try to ignore the problem of climate change. Gov. Rick Perry, digging in his boot heels, seems to admit only grudgingly that climate change is occurring, never mind that science has concluded that it is being driven by humankind's use of fuels that produce carbon dioxide - coal, oil and natural gas, primarily.LiNeBrEaKPerry says potential federal legislation to begin limiting carbon dioxide production could harm the Texas economy. But drought and rising sea levels won't? Texas needs to find a way to take the lead on this problem, not try to pretend it will go away.

The Boston Globe 	January 5, 2009 Monday   THIRD EDITION	Sensible climate legislation  	OP-ED; Pg. A11  	731 words  	DESPITE our wounded economy, President-elect Obama is determined to address the problem of climate change early in his first term. Congressional leaders seem anxious to accommodate him by enacting legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions. But many members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, may balk at the prospect of emission limits that could lead to increased energy prices at a time when consumers can ill afford them. Experience with one regional cap-and-trade program suggests a federal program can be enacted that avoids energy price increases, at least until the economy has had time to recover. LiNeBrEaKMassachusetts and nine other northeastern states recently required their fossil-fuel power plants to purchase allowances that match their carbon emissions. Early sales of allowances by this multistate compact, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, have resulted in low prices, slightly over $3 per ton of emissions. That translates to the equivalent of less than 2 percent of average wholesale electricity prices. These prices are the result of a regional cap on carbon emissions that is slightly above the level expected over the next few years under business-as-usual conditions. Not until 2015 does the cap begin to decrease, and then only gradually, each year through 2020. With our economy in recession, demand for electricity will grow slowly, if at all, keeping allowance prices low and avoiding carbon-related price increases, at least through 2015.LiNeBrEaKMembers of Congress, not to mention environmentalists, might ask: Why bother to establish a cap that does not reduce emissions right away? The answer lies in the nature of climate change. It is not a problem that can be solved in a few years. It will take coordinated global action and vast technological changes over many years to meaningfully slow the process of climate change. We must achieve decades of modest, but compounding, changes in the way we use energy to achieve a low-carbon economy. We need the determination of the tortoise rather than the hyper-activity of the hare. Even so, there are several good reasons for establishing a business-as-usual emissions cap right away.LiNeBrEaKFirst, promptly enacting a federal cap-and-trade system gives all carbon emitters an unambiguous warning to prepare for a future in which emissions will count against them. A decade-long schedule of gradually decreasing carbon limits will encourage entrepreneurs and investors to intensify efforts to develop new technologies that control, reduce, and sequester emissions. Some of these innovations will need years to achieve commercial viability; the sooner their evolution begins, the better.LiNeBrEaKSecond, even if allowance prices are low in the short run, emitters who can inexpensively reduce their emissions will do so, and sell their surplus allowances to those who need extras. These transactions will begin to reveal the cost to reduce emissions and provide the price signals for doing so that our economy urgently needs.LiNeBrEaKThird, setting a cap, initially, at current levels of emissions provides a low-cost form of insurance against a worst-case scenario. For example, if a technological problem required the extended shutdown of many nuclear plants, the cap would limit emissions from carbon-intensive oil and coal plants and encourage the use of carbon-free renewable energy and energy efficiency.LiNeBrEaKThe northeastern states are selling most of their allowances through public auctions. The proceeds are being invested mainly in efficiency programs and in wind and solar energy. Likewise, a federal program will work best for consumers if the government sells carbon allowances and invests at least a portion of the proceeds in similar programs, as well as in the science of sequestering carbon. These investments will help keep the cost of carbon allowances low, minimize consumer price impacts, and create valuable jobs. Allowance revenues that cannot be productively used in these ways should be returned to consumers through tax cuts.LiNeBrEaKWith a business-as-usual emissions cap in the early years and the strategic use of revenue from allowance sales, the president and Congress can move aggressively to limit carbon emissions, despite our weakened economy.LiNeBrEaKDavid O'Connor is senior vice president for energy and clean technology at ML Strategies, LLC.

Khaleej Times (Dubai, United Arab Emirates)  	January 5, 2009 Monday 	Oman Plans Several Events for Environment Day on January 8  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	475 words  	Jan. 5--MUSCAT -- Oman will mark its annual 'Environment Day' on January 8 with a host of activities spearheaded by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs. The Muscat Municipality, the Ministry of Agriculture and The Art of Living Foundation (AoL) will also be actively involved. LiNeBrEaKEvents planned include tree planting, exhibitions and seminars, cleaning of coral reefs and beaches, planting of mangroves, educational visits to nature reserves, sports, painting and photographic competitions.LiNeBrEaKThe main activity, the Environment Ministry said, would focus on tree plantation, being organised as part of the worldwide initiative called 'Mission Green Earth, Stand Up and Take Action' (Mgesuta). Mgesuta was launched jointly by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), United Nations Millennium Campaign (UNMC) and AoL with the objective of planting 100 million trees worldwide between July 2008 and July 2009.LiNeBrEaK"Mgesuta will go a long way in achieving environmental sustainability, one of the eight millennium development goals," a spokesman for the ministry said. Till October 2008, in 37 countries worldwide, almost 65 million saplings had been planted. In Oman too, till that date, 5,500 saplings were distributed in schools.LiNeBrEaKA patch of land, close to the Al Sahwa Roundabout in Seeb, has been earmarked for tree plantation by around 200 students from various schools, citizens and residents on January 8. Native trees like Tulh (Acacia gerard), Shu'/ Ban (moringa peregrine), Ghaf (Prosopis cineraria), Simr (acacia tortilis), Sedar (Ziziphus spina-christi), which are most suited to the soil and climate conditions of the land, have been identified for plantation.LiNeBrEaK"An exhibition to educate children on the characteristics of these native plants and in general to make them more aware of the importance of maintaining and nurturing our environment through the greening of the earth will be set up," the spokesman said.LiNeBrEaK"To bring in an air of festivity one of the schools will have a band in attendance.LiNeBrEaK"A call for participation to all schools is being made through letters inviting them to depute students for the plantation event," he added.LiNeBrEaKCombating global warming, reducing pollution, improving the quality of soil, air and replenishing ground water were imperatives that each individual needed to take responsibility for and act upon immediately, the ministry spokesman said.LiNeBrEaKravindranath@khaleejtimes.com	ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (89%); SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE (78%); SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); TIMBER TRACT OPERATIONS (75%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (74%); ISLANDS and REEFS (73%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (73%); PHOTOGRAPHY (72%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (72%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  		DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (93%) UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (94%); OMAN (94%)  	January 5, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009    	Ravindra Nath, Khaleej Times, Dubai, United Arab Emirates  	UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME (56%); UNITED NATIONS (56%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	General  	20090105-KJ-Oman-Plans-Several-Events-for-Environment-Day-on-January-8-0105  	KJ  		MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (61%)

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	January 5, 2009 Monday 	A wine fan's New Year's resolutions  	FOOD NEWS  	506 words  	Despite what you may have heard, wine lovers are not perfect. We need New Year's resolutions too.LiNeBrEaKHere are mine:LiNeBrEaK_I will lose 30 pounds (OK, that's out of the way).LiNeBrEaK_I will taste every wine I come across that I've never heard of before. This is a rewarding resolution. In 2008, I learned about grillo, a light, crisp, wine from Sicily from the grape of the same name that tastes a little like green tea. A couple of years ago I tasted a cabernet sauvignon made in Cuba. Well, one out of two isn't bad.LiNeBrEaK_I will try wines from every new wine area I learn about. Ever have a syrah from British Columbia? It's by Mission Hill, and it tastes of black plums, tobacco, black pepper and red meat. Yes, all at once. LiNeBrEaK_Speaking of that, I will adopt the philosophy of "illegitimati non carborundum" (look it up; they won't let me say it here in English) when people get on my case about enthusiastic wine descriptions. It's my hobby. As Billy Joel would say, "I have been a fool for lesser things." If I say a wine smells like iodine or red meat, it does. To me, anyway.LiNeBrEaK_I will continue my quest to try a wine from all 50 states. One of the best wines I've tasted was a sweet dessert wine made of pumpkins in Illinois. They chunked up the pumpkins in a tree shredder and somehow got them to ferment. Now I hear they make wine in Alaska.LiNeBrEaK_I will stop making fun of blush zinfandel, even though it has every reason to blush.LiNeBrEaK_In hard economic times, I will become relentless in pursuit of really nice wines cheaper than $10. Last year's winner was the 2007 Bodega Norton Malbec from Mendoza, Argentina: chocolate-cherry aromas and flavors; soft, ripe and mellow; $9.LiNeBrEaK_I will try wines in boxes. Lots of them. I will do it with an open mind. I will report back the results honestly.LiNeBrEaK_I will take with a grain of salt those medical studies that say wine prevents heart attack, stroke, glaucoma, diabetes, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's. I will take comfort knowing those researchers are raising some of the healthiest mice on the planet.LiNeBrEaK_I will taste an English wine, if I can find one (and work up my courage). The British press says that, due to global warming, there are more than 200 wineries today in the Sceptered Isle. And if they're as good as English food, well ...LiNeBrEaK_Oh, don't write in. There's nothing I love more than steak and kidney pie (wait a minute ... kidney?!)LiNeBrEaK_Even though Chateau Mouton Rothschild's price has plummeted by half to less than $600 a bottle, I will not urge a federal bailout of the wine industry.LiNeBrEaK_I will try not to lose my taste for expensive wines. I will try to cultivate a richer class of friends. (If they have a boat, so much the better.)

The Monitor (McAllen, Texas)  	January 5, 2009 Monday 	Climate change requires quick, decisive action  	COMMENTARY  	858 words  	NEW YORK _ Like a monster movie, climate change casts an ominous, larger-than-life shadow. The American Museum of Natural History's special exhibition (http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/climatechange/) depicts it well. After witnessing such dramatic images of searing heat, melting ice, unusually powerful storms, rising seas and other devastating occurrences, it would be impossible for anyone to ignore or minimize the seriousness of the situation.LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, "Climate Change: The Threat to Life and a New Energy Future" leaves you with a sense of optimism. It suggests practical solutions, and offers options for meeting global energy demands and reducing emissions. The task of making the right policy choices in this area will join the growing list of challenges for the incoming Obama administration. Fortunately, President-elect Barack Obama has kept a watchful eye on the environment and climate change, and has assembled a skilled, savvy team of advisors. LiNeBrEaKStill, it is worth emphasizing that climate change has a unique sense of urgency attached to it. Unresolved, it could pose the worst danger of all to humankind. Consider that the terrifying impacts mentioned above make up just the first wave of disruption. After the heat sears, the ice melts, the storms unleash their fury and the seas rise, people _ from those in individual communities to entire national populations _ will have to contend with massive migration, more widespread diseases, shortages of all kinds, civil violence and wars.LiNeBrEaKFor more advice on what we might do, I turned to environmentalist Peter Pritchard, a turtle and tortoise specialist, who was named a "Hero of the Planet" by Time magazine. As head of the Chelonian Research Institute, he travels extensively and has an especially astute finger on the pulse of the Earth.LiNeBrEaKPritchard recommended that the Obama administration take a leadership role by:LiNeBrEaK_Continuing to study climate change, which is not fully understood. It is so colossal and complicated _ and so much a mixture of both natural (forest fires and volcanic eruptions) and artificially produced (the burning of fossil fuels) phenomena _ that we need persistent efforts by the best brains to get a better handle on it.LiNeBrEaK_Preparing Americans for the realities to come. After centuries of pumping carbon into the atmosphere, we should brace ourselves for the possibility that climate change is already too entrenched for organized human action to reverse it. We should not delude ourselves. At best, we may be looking at a partial fix, not a complete one.LiNeBrEaK_Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. We clearly were able to make adjustments in our personal use during recent months when the price of gasoline skyrocketed. In actuality, we could routinely get around in much smaller and lighter vehicles. In addition, we could replace fossil fuels with a wide spectrum of alternatives. These range from other sources of energy, such as wind, wave, nuclear (with appropriate safeguards), solar and truly clean coal (if that is possible), to walking, bicycling and designing towns differently.LiNeBrEaK_Rethinking the way that we develop our coastlines. Americans, along with people everywhere, have often had commercial and recreational motivations for building their seaside communities. For example, we have treated barrier islands as if they were secure, rather than a defense for the more stable land behind them. Despite the inevitable resistance, we should greatly reduce _ if not entirely stop _ building in areas that are essentially impossible to protect from rising seas and intensifying storms.LiNeBrEaK_Re-evaluating our national security culture. We have been dismally behind the curve for a number of years now, continuing to believe that warfare can resolve difficult questions or disputes. By now, we should have learned that conducting long-distance wars is too expensive in terms of lives and resources. Why not look to Europe for inspiration? It opted to create a union and has managed to avoid war within that structure thus far. That achievement represents quite an improvement over what had happened during the preceding centuries, when conflict was rife. Nations that are closely linked economically, politically and culturally have much more of an incentive to settle differences amicably and deal with dangers such as climate change in a collective manner.LiNeBrEaKPritchard's ideas are worth considering because, unlike a monster movie, climate change is real. We must move quickly and decisively, lest it overwhelm and consume us.LiNeBrEaKABOUT THE WRITERLiNeBrEaKJohn C.

The New York Times 	January 5, 2009 Monday   Late Edition - Final	A 50-Year Farm Bill  	Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED CONTRIBUTORS; Pg. 21  	656 words  	Wes Jackson is a plant geneticist and president of The Land Institute in Salina, Kan. Wendell Berry is a farmer and writer in Port Royal, Ky.LiNeBrEaKTHE extraordinary rainstorms last June caused catastrophic soil erosion in the grain lands of Iowa, where there were gullies 200 feet wide. But even worse damage is done over the long term under normal rainfall -- by the little rills and sheets of erosion on incompletely covered or denuded cropland, and by various degradations resulting from industrial procedures and technologies alien to both agriculture and nature. LiNeBrEaK  Soil that is used and abused in this way is as nonrenewable as (and far more valuable than) oil. Unlike oil, it has no technological substitute -- and no powerful friends in the halls of government. LiNeBrEaK  Agriculture has too often involved an insupportable abuse and waste of soil, ever since the first farmers took away the soil-saving cover and roots  of perennial plants. Civilizations have destroyed themselves by destroying their farmland. This irremediable loss, never enough noticed, has been made worse by the huge monocultures and continuous soil-exposure of the agriculture we now practice.LiNeBrEaK  To the problem of soil loss, the industrialization of agriculture has added pollution by toxic chemicals, now universally present in our farmlands and streams. Some of this toxicity is associated with the widely acclaimed method of minimum tillage. We should not poison our soils to save them. LiNeBrEaK  Industrial agricultural has made our food supply entirely dependent on fossil fuels and, by substituting technological ''solutions'' for human work and care, has virtually destroyed the cultures of husbandry (imperfect as they may have been) once indigenous to family farms and farming neighborhoods.LiNeBrEaK  Clearly, our present ways of agriculture are not sustainable, and so our food supply is not sustainable. We must restore ecological health to our agricultural landscapes, as well as economic and cultural stability to our rural communities. LiNeBrEaK  For 50 or 60 years, we have let ourselves believe that as long as we have money we will have food. That is a mistake. If we continue our offenses against the land and the labor by which we are fed, the food supply will decline, and we will have a problem far more complex than the failure of our paper economy. The government will bring forth no food by providing hundreds of billons of dollars to the agribusiness corporations. LiNeBrEaK  Any restorations will require, above all else, a substantial increase in the acreages of perennial plants. The most immediately practicable way of doing this is to go back to crop rotations that include hay, pasture and grazing animals. LiNeBrEaK  But a more radical response is necessary if we are to keep eating and preserve our land at the same time. In fact, research in Canada, Australia, China and the United States over the last 30 years suggests that perennialization of the major  grain crops like wheat, rice, sorghum and sunflowers can be developed in the foreseeable future. By increasing the use of mixtures of grain-bearing perennials, we can better protect  the soil and substantially reduce greenhouse gases, fossil-fuel use and toxic pollution. LiNeBrEaK  Carbon sequestration would increase, and the husbandry of water and soil nutrients would become much more efficient. And with an increase in the use of perennial plants and grazing animals would come more employment opportunities in agriculture -- provided, of course, that farmers would be paid justly for their work and their goods.LiNeBrEaK  Thoughtful farmers and consumers everywhere are already making many necessary changes in the production and marketing of food. But we also need a national agricultural policy that is based upon ecological principles. We need a 50-year farm bill that addresses forthrightly the problems of soil loss and degradation, toxic pollution, fossil-fuel dependency and the destruction of rural communities. LiNeBrEaK  This is a political issue, certainly, but it far transcends the farm politics we are used to. It is an issue as close to every one of us as our own stomachs.

John Yoo, a deputy assistant attorney general from 2001 to 2003, is a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.LiNeBrEaKTHE Constitution's Treaty Clause has long been seen, rightly, as a bulwark against presidential inclinations to lock the United States into unwise foreign commitments. The clause will likely be tested by Barack Obama's administration, as the new president and Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton, led by the legal academics in whose circles they have long traveled, contemplate binding down American power and interests in a dense web of treaties and international bureaucracies.LiNeBrEaK  Like past presidents, Mr. Obama will likely be tempted to avoid the requirement that treaties must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate. The usual methods around this constitutional constraint are executive agreements or a majority vote in the House and Senate to pass a treaty as a simple law (known as a Congressional-executive agreement).  LiNeBrEaK  Executive agreements have an acknowledged but limited place in our foreign affairs.Congressional-executive agreements are far more troubling. They have evoked scathing attacks by constitutional experts and have been strongly resisted in the Senate, at least so far. LiNeBrEaK  The framers of the Constitution designed the treaty process with a bias against ''entangling alliances,'' as Thomas Jefferson described them in his first inaugural address. They designated the Senate as the body responsible to protect the interests of the states from being bargained away by the president in deals with foreign nations. The framers required a supermajority to ensure that treaties would reflect a broad consensus and careful, mature decision-making.LiNeBrEaK  America needs to maintain its sovereignty and autonomy, not to subordinate its policies, foreign or domestic, to international control. On a broad variety of issues -- many of which sound more like domestic rather than foreign policy -- the re-emergence of the benignly labeled ''global governance'' movement is well under way in the Obama transition. LiNeBrEaK  Candidate Obama promised to ''re-engage'' and ''work constructively within'' the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Will the new president pass a new Kyoto climate accord through Congress by sidestepping the constitutional requirement to persuade two-thirds of the Senate? LiNeBrEaK  Draconian restrictions on energy use would follow. A majority of the Congress would be much easier for Mr. Obama to get than a supermajority of the Senate. A scholar at the Brookings Institution has already proposed that a new president overcome objections to this environmentalists' holy grail by evading the Treaty Clause. LiNeBrEaK  President George W. Bush resisted many efforts at global governance. But his administration still sometimes fell into the temptation to flout the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority in the Senate. LiNeBrEaK  In 2002, the administration considered submitting the Treaty of Moscow, a nuclear arms reduction agreement, for majority approval of Congress. Vice President-elect Joe Biden, who was then the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, privately made clear that he would vigorously oppose such an attempt to evade the Senate's constitutional prerogatives. The administration agreed to submit the agreement as a treaty, and the Moscow agreement cleared the Senate. LiNeBrEaK  We hope the new vice president will not reverse his commitment to the Senate's constitutional authority. But an administration determined to tie one hand behind America's back might use Congressional-executive agreements to push the nation all too easily into quixotic and impractical global governance regimes. LiNeBrEaK  President Bill Clinton signed Kyoto, but the Senate in effect rejected it. He also signed the Rome Treaty of 1998 that established an International Criminal Court, which would subject American soldiers and officials to unaccountable international prosecutors and judges for alleged war crimes (including, potentially, the undefined crime of ''aggression''). Mr. Clinton did not even send this agreement to the Senate. Mr. Bush ''unsigned'' it. Mr. Obama might re-sign it and seek approval by only a majority of both houses of Congress.LiNeBrEaK  Other international regimes might restrict America's freedom of action to defend itself. In 1999, the Senate rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would have undermined America's ability to verify the reliability and effectiveness of its nuclear deterrent. Mr. Obama has said he supports ratification. The historical precedents are that major arms control agreements must receive the approval of two-thirds of the Senate. LiNeBrEaK  President Bush, like President Clinton, did not sign a global agreement that would ban antipersonnel land mines, on the grounds that they are a key component of the American defense of South Korea. But his administration has pressed for ratification of the treaty on the law of the sea, which would subject disputes over the free passage of American naval vessels to the jurisdiction of an international maritime court -- which the Senate has so far refused to ratify. LiNeBrEaK  If Mr. Obama were to submit either of these agreements for approval by a simple majority of the House and Senate, his actions would pose a serious challenge to American principles of law and democratic governance. Global governance schemes delegate power to independent international organizations to make and enforce laws that would apply domestically, by international bureaucrats who are unaccountable to Congress, the president, American public opinion or the democratic process. LiNeBrEaK  It is true that some multinational economic agreements, like Bretton Woods, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement, went into effect after approval by majorities of Congress rather than two-thirds of the Senate. But international agreements that go beyond the rules of international trade and finance -- that involve significant national-security commitments,or that purport to delegate lawmaking and enforcement functions to international organizations, or that could fundamentally alter the American constitutional system of individual rights -- should receive the intense scrutiny of the treaty process, regardless of their policy merits. LiNeBrEaK  By insisting on the proper constitutional process for treaty-making, Republicans can join Mr. Obama in advancing a bipartisan foreign policy. They can also help strike the proper balance between the legislative and executive branches that so many have called for in recent years.

New Haven Register (Connecticut)  	January 5, 2009 Monday 	Coffee has its perks, despite economy  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	512 words  	Jan. 5--NEW HAVEN -- There appears to be one true growth industry in the Elm City: coffee shops.LiNeBrEaKIn the next couple of weeks, two more are scheduled to open, both of them on or near the Yale campus.LiNeBrEaKAnd in the springtime, yet another coffee outlet, with outdoor seating, is expected to debut on Orange Street in the East Rock neighborhood. LiNeBrEaKThe new places will join an array of Dunkin' Donuts and assorted independents scattered across the city.LiNeBrEaKThe owners of the new shops say they're not worried about the economic meltdown or the ever-spiraling number of coffee joints.LiNeBrEaKPeople just have to have their coffee.LiNeBrEaKA new Willoughby's, on the ground floor of the Jeffrey H. Loria Center for the History of Art at 190 York St. (near Chapel Street) is being advertised via "Coming soon" signs in the windows. The building adjoins the refurbished Paul Rudolph Hall.LiNeBrEaKBob Williams and Barry Levine, co-founders and co-owners of Willoughby's, said in an interview from their Branford office they expect to open in about two weeks.LiNeBrEaKWilliams said, "I don't know how many coffee shops New Haven can support. But we've always had good luck in New Haven."LiNeBrEaKHe noted Willoughby's had four outlets in New Haven at one point. The one remaining in the city is at Whitney Avenue and Grove Street, but there is a Willoughby's in Branford and in Madison.LiNeBrEaKLevine said it's using "a narrow lens" to call any Willoughby's a "coffee shop."LiNeBrEaK"We're coffee roasters," he said, pointing out that many customers buy pounds of coffee.LiNeBrEaKAlthough Williams said the new Willoughby's will be geared toward Yale students and faculty, he said it will be open to the public.LiNeBrEaKA few blocks away, at 82B-84 Wall St., workers are preparing Blue State Coffee, which will have 50 seats. The workers said the target for opening is around the middle of this month.LiNeBrEaKBlue State Coffee already has a shop in Providence, R.I., and soon will open another one there, at the Brown University Book Store. Ten percent of the proceeds go to causes such as global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe third entry is Cafe Romeo, destined for 534 Orange St., former home of Bunnell Paint and Hardware.LiNeBrEaKThe people backing it are Romeo Simeone, owner of Romeo and Cesare Gourmet Shoppe at 771 Orange St. and two of his business partners. He said he thinks it will be open before Easter.LiNeBrEaKHe reported great neighborhood interest in the cafe. "Everybody asks me, 'When? When?' "LiNeBrEaKSimeone said he is not concerned about competition from other coffee houses. He believes the outdoor seating will attract mothers with children in strollers and young people.LiNeBrEaK"With the economy, people can still afford to have a little sandwich, a coffee, a little piece of cake," he reasoned.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	January 5, 2009 Monday 	How to rewrite the biz-school curriculum  	COMMENTARY; Pg. 5  	663 words  	WELLESLEYLiNeBrEaKAS THE YEAR draws to a close, we find ourselves in a global economy where many of the long-held fundamentals for doing business are no longer valid.LiNeBrEaKFor the past 25 years, the basic models taught at business schools were predicated on three key assumptions   easy access to credit, cheap energy and an abundant supply of skilled labor at low cost. Each of these assumptions is now in a state of flux.LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, the global credit crisis and its disastrous aftermath have erased the long-held assurance that market mechanisms always return the economy to some measure of coherence. LiNeBrEaKFor business schools, the challenges of realigning their curricula with the realities of today s marketplace have never been greater. Twenty years ago, when I chaired the process of renewing the Harvard Business School curriculum, I believed that the half life of what passes for content in a business school was 10 years at most. Today it is far less.LiNeBrEaKSo, what should business schools teach the next generation of business leaders?LiNeBrEaKFirst, as former General Electric Chairman Jack Welch advises, for much of our curriculum we should throw away our textbooks and  teach today.  We need to be thoughtful observers and interpreters of our surroundings and, in Welch s words,  see the world as it is, not as it ought to be.  How can we purport to prepare students for their futures in managerial careers without developing an appreciation of the failures embedded in today s economic and social realities?LiNeBrEaKIf we are to teach issues as they are   not as they ought to be or used to be   we need to address the narrowness of the traditional business-school curriculum. LiNeBrEaKThere is often a huge disconnect between the way problems are organized in the classroom and the way they actually occur in the world. Courses are typically organized by function, but managers must grapple with problems that rarely can be defined by a single function. So, not only is content without context less important, it is the integration of that content around problems and opportunities that prepares students for real-world decision-making.LiNeBrEaKStudents need to be able to learn in an environment where the overwhelming number of assumptions they are working under will change at a rapid pace. That is the role of entrepreneurial learning: teaching students to be resourceful in making and identifying opportunities wherever they might exist and to be able to mobilize resources to create economic value from these opportunities.LiNeBrEaKAnd, it is no longer just economic value that matters. Business schools have an obligation beyond helping our students to build better businesses. We must educate them to build a better world. As Tom Friedman noted in his latest book, Hot, Flat and Crowded, if we are going to make progress on problems like global warming and poverty,  we will need new tools, new infrastructure, new ways of thinking and new ways of collaborating with others    the very kinds of tools and experiences that a relevant business-school education can provide.LiNeBrEaKFinally, since we know we are in a world that will continue to evolve and change, business schools should build their curricula on a foundation of critical thought and timeless skills for lifelong learning, which have become substantially more important. In fact, what most people call graduation, and academics know as commencement, is really more about the latter   that we are beginning a process of systematic lifelong learning to cope with a world that is changing at a rate much faster than anyone could ever have anticipated.LiNeBrEaKLooking ahead, we are going to see fundamental restructuring in our economy, in our essential industries, and in higher education   and all of those restructurings will provide business schools with an enormous opportunity to play a leadership role in defining what comes next.LiNeBrEaKLeonard A. Schlesinger is president of Babson College. His previous job was as vice chairman and chief operating officer of Limited Brands.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	January 05, 2009 Monday 	THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM 2008  	BUSINESS; Pg. B7  	707 words  	LAST YEAR WAS a banner year for lousy business headlines. Wall Street's demise, a tanked economy in recession, plummeting 401(k)s, massive layoffs, government bailouts, and crooks who swindle charities out of business. As a workplace coach, I am constantly preaching that debriefing and mining "lessons learned" is good business practice. What we are unconscious about, unaware of or blind to can kill us. With that in mind, let's take a look back at 2008. What can we learn from this dismal year? Here are my top 10 lessons:LiNeBrEaK1. Don't plead for taxpayer bailout money from your luxury corporate jet. The chief executive officers from the top three U.S. automakers made what will undoubtedly be one of the top PR blunders in business history. LiNeBrEaK2. When asking for a loan, come in with a solid plan and strategy. This lesson comes from the same three automaker CEOs. This is Business 101. Isn't that what CEOs are paid to do - come up with a strategic plan? Speaking of strategy, how is it that following years of rising gas prices and dependence on foreign oil the auto industry was caught so off guard with their heads in the sand still churning out gas guzzlers? Perhaps they were out of touch. One GM exec was quoted saying that global warming is a "crock of (expletive)."LiNeBrEaK3. Lesson three comes again from - you guessed it - the big three automakers. Have a Plan B. By GM's Chief Operating Officer Fritz Henderson's astonishing own admission following their most recent trip to beg for a Washington bailout, "there is no Plan B." Another golden rule of business: Always have a contingency plan.LiNeBrEaK4. OK, enough beating up on automaker execs; let's move to investors. If it sounds too good to be true, it is. Bernard Madoff's $50 billion Ponzi scheme was a classic lesson for all business people: Do your homework. Oh, and don't put all your eggs in one basket. There are more lessons from this headline but I don't have enough space.LiNeBrEaK5. Don't party with the government's bailout money. Work on restoring public trust instead. AIG's lavish corporate vacation a week after taking $85 billion in an emergency bailout loan is a case study for the PR books. What were they thinking? And their response that this is "standard practice" was worse. Do they really think the general public is that stupid? Who among us would equate a bankruptcy scenario to "business as usual?"LiNeBrEaK6. Avoid unreasonable risks. Lending money to anyone who asks for it isn't good business practice. We need only look in our backyard to Washington Mutual for this lesson.LiNeBrEaK7. Adapt and thrive (it's true in nature and business). Apple's core is computers, but the popularity of the iPhone 3G (now available at a Wal-Mart near you) is a bright spot in an otherwise glum business year. Apple offers a lesson in how to evolve and thrive in business. It was one of the few that posted a profit in the fourth quarter, having sold 6. 89 million iPhones during the quarter.LiNeBrEaK8. What happens on Wall Street is felt on Main Street. From large to small, business is hurting, which means stores are closing and jobs are lost. According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, 73,000 retail stores may close in the first half of 2009. Unfortunately, the ball truly does roll downhill.LiNeBrEaK9. A penny saved is a penny earned. Really. Debt is the underpinning of all that went wrong in 2008.LiNeBrEaK10. Think twice before hitting "send" with your snippy e-mail response. Former Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo got into hot water after apparently clicking "reply to all" instead of "forward" describing his response to a struggling mortgage customer's plea for help as "disgusting" and "unbelievable." Mozilo's nasty-gram fired back directly to the customer (who then posted it on the Internet - oops) made it clear to everyone who was truly "disgusting" and "unbelievable."LiNeBrEaKLet's raise our glasses to having 2008 behind us. May we learn from our past and our mistakes.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	January 5, 2009 Monday   THIRD EDITION	In danger and in the spotlight Threatened species - including two that can be seen in our area - grace pages of National Geographic. UNDER THE MICROSCOPE  	NEWS; Pg. A2  	759 words  	It's been a rough year for endangered species.LiNeBrEaKFirst, the polar bear was listed as threatened, becoming a sad symbol of global climate change.LiNeBrEaKMore recently, President George W. Bush's administration pushed through a revision of the Endangered Species Act that many groups believe severely impedes the benchmark law.LiNeBrEaKBut finally, endangered species are getting some prominent exposure this month as many of them - including two from the St. Louis area - appear in the January issue of National Geographic. LiNeBrEaKThe article, "Last One," by Verlyn Klinkenborg, features dramatic photos of more than two dozen threatened or endangered species - everything from a grizzly bear to a Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit, which went extinct before publication.LiNeBrEaKAnna, a Mexican gray wolf at the Wild Canid Survival and Research Center in Eureka, is featured on page 103 of the magazine, and about a dozen American burying beetles from the St. Louis Zoo occupy a photo spread on pages 96 and 97.LiNeBrEaKThe animals were photographed almost two years ago by Joel Sartore, who has shot 25 National Geographic stories - including six on endangered species.LiNeBrEaKSartore has been taking photos of the wolves at the Eureka sanctuary since the early 1990s and has a good relationship with the staff there, said Sue Linsdsey, the center's director.LiNeBrEaKAnna was an easy choice as a model. Not only is she one of the most genetically valuable wolves in the federal Mexican gray wolf reintroduction program, she's not terribly afraid of people, because she was hand-raised by the center's staff after her littermates died. "She's Little Miss Photogenic," Lindsey said. "She looks almost huggable."LiNeBrEaKSartore spent the better part of the day at the center in Eureka back in 2007 photographing Anna in her enclosure. When it began to snow, Sartore got the shot that landed Anna in National Geographic, where she represents her dwindling species.LiNeBrEaKMexican gray wolves were considered to be extinct in the wild until they were reintroduced in the Southwest in 1998.LiNeBrEaKThe Wild Canid center is the only facility in the United States to have a captive breeding program for both red and Mexican gray wolves. Currently located at Washington University's Tyson Research Facility, the center plans to relocate to newly acquired property in Jefferson County and is raising funds for the move.LiNeBrEaK"Seeing her in an article like this is just huge for us," Lindsey said.LiNeBrEaKOver at the zoo, Sartore photographed the beetles with the help of keeper Glenn Frei and Bob Merz, zoological manager of invertebrates.LiNeBrEaKMerz said the beetles were photographed as they crawled across a piece of glass. The beetle wranglers stood constant guard over the insects, which have steadily declined in population since at least the 1920s.LiNeBrEaK"The trick is knowing their behaviors," said Merz, director of the zoo's American burying beetle conservation center. "You've got to be able to move quickly, because they can helicopter right out of there."LiNeBrEaKLike Lindsey, Merz said that Sartore was incredibly patient and respectful of the fact he was working with rare animals.LiNeBrEaKHaving the beetles appear in National Geographic - a magazine that's often collected and kept for years - makes the experience quite meaningful, Merz said.LiNeBrEaK"It really reaffirms the work we're doing with endangered species and why they're so very important," he said.LiNeBrEaKYOU CAN HOWL WITH THE WOLVES AND WATCH THE BEETLES BURROWLiNeBrEaKWhile it might be tough to get an autograph, Anna, the Mexican gray wolf, and the American burying beetles that appear this month in the National Geographic are available for viewing.LiNeBrEaKo The beetles are on display at the Insectarium at the St. Louis Zoo. The zoo is open every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.LiNeBrEaKFor more information, visit stlzoo.org or call 314-781-0900.LiNeBrEaKo Anna and the other wolves at the Wild Canid Survival and Research Center in Eureka can be visited by appointment. Regularly scheduled public tours and programs are offered on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Private tours can be scheduled on those days, and some weekdays are also available.LiNeBrEaKThe center is offering special programs on Friday and Saturday evenings in January, when visitors can learn more about wolves and get the chance to howl with them.LiNeBrEaKAdults only can get a chance to howl with the wolves on Jan. 16 during the center's monthly wine and cheese program.LiNeBrEaKAll events require a reservation. Some book weeks in advance, so call early. Program prices vary.LiNeBrEaKTo make reservations or inquire about tours or programs, call 636-938-5900.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	January 5, 2009 Monday   FINAL EDITION	Warmer climate is health threat  	EDITORIAL; Pg. 013  	759 words  	Acording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5 to 20 percent of the U.S. population gets the flu each year. Of those, about 200,000 people require hospitalization and 36,000 ultimately die.LiNeBrEaKBut imagine if, in addition to the stresses of cold and flu season, American health providers were annually confronted with widespread outbreaks of malaria or a host of other diseases that could spread into the United States due to global warming.LiNeBrEaKIf this sounds like a scenario from a Hollywood thriller, think again. LiNeBrEaKAccording to a growing body of research, the threat of global warming bringing new diseases to America's shores is one that U.S. policy-makers need to take seriously.LiNeBrEaKAs the world warms, diseases are spreading farther, heat waves are lasting longer and air quality is declining. In 2005, the World Health Organization stated that the effects of climate change might have caused more than 150,000 deaths in the year 2000, and unless action were taken soon, succeeding years would likely fare worse.LiNeBrEaKIndeed, a report released last month at a conference of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene warned that changing climates, when combined with international air travel, could help spread the scourge of malaria to areas in the United States and Europe that have historically remained untouched.LiNeBrEaKEvery outbreak of disease, or weather phenomena with adverse implications for human health - such as smog - has multiple causes. We can never say any isolated event stems solely from global warming.LiNeBrEaKBut using that as an excuse for inaction misses the larger point. Many public health threats are closely tied to the climate, and the hotter it is, the more likely these threats become. Global warming pollution, therefore, is stacking the deck against our own health.LiNeBrEaKSmog, for instance, is caused by the interaction between air pollutants, sunlight and heat. The United States regulates those pollutants leading to smog, but currently does not directly control the emissions that cause global warming. This ignores a key part of the problem, as rising temperatures are projected to increase U.S. smog-related deaths 4. 5 percent by mid-century, with a corresponding jump in asthma attacks, lung damage and cardiac arrest.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming is not just an abstract concern about wildlife at the world's poles. It's also a problem that hits close to home, and health professionals already see warning signs. In an issue devoted largely to global warming, the Journal of the American Medical Association urged, "It is not too late and none too soon for the health care community to advocate policies that wean us from fossil fuels and ultimately mitigate the extent of human-induced climate change."LiNeBrEaKThe spread of malaria poses one such problem. According to the WHO, in some countries with a heavy malaria burden the disease can account for as much as 40 percent of public health expenditures. This includes a combination of health care costs imposed both on the public (such as through the need for new infrastructure to handle increased medical demands) and directly on individuals and families (through increased personal expenditures on items such as antimalarial drugs).LiNeBrEaKWith the U.S. health care system already under tremendous pressure, the additional challenge of global warming is one that our health care providers can scarcely afford.LiNeBrEaKLast summer, the Environmental Protection Agency released the most comprehensive analysis to date on the U.S. health problems caused by global warming. That report, which compiled research from dozens of previous studies, found it "very likely" that heat-related morbidity and mortality would increase in the decades ahead, with broad impacts spanning every region of the country.LiNeBrEaKNevertheless, even with this report in hand, the agency has yet to officially declare whether greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health. While the EPA should get some credit for sounding an alarm, the agency hasn't provided any significant steps to address America's unrestrained carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKWhile relaxation in a warmer climate was historically prescribed for colds and a wide range of other ailments, global warming is nobody's cure. The health reports on climate change, from the EPA, CDC and WHO, should provide the stimulus for the next Congress and the Obama administration to enact binding, science-based limits on the emissions that cause global warming.LiNeBrEaKPhyllis Cuttino is director of the domestic global warming campaign for the Pew Environment Group and may be reached at pcuttino@pewtrusts.org	PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (91%); DISEASES and DISORDERS (91%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); POPULATION SIZE (90%); TROPICAL DISEASES (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); INFLUENZA (90%); MALARIA (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); SMOG (89%); AIR POLLUTION (88%); HEALTH CARE COSTS (78%); HEALTH CARE (77%); TROPICAL MEDICINE (77%); EMISSIONS (76%); BUSINESS and PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (74%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (73%); AIR QUALITY (73%); CONFERENCES and CONVENTIONS (70%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (68%); ASTHMA (60%); COMMON COLD (73%)  		NEW JERSEY, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (99%); EUROPE (79%)  	January 5, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Newark Morning Ledger Co.

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 	January 5, 2009 Monday 	Put nuclear energy on the table  	LETTERS  	420 words  	In Minnesota's endeavor to formulate new policy on carbon-free energy generation, let's consider all alternatives.LiNeBrEaKIt's amazing to me that, given all the talk about solving our "energy crisis," Minnesota policymakers haven't taken the basic step of making sure that all carbon-free generation sources are on the table. LiNeBrEaKMinnesota is one of 14 states that forbids regulators from even considering a new nuclear energy plant. In fact, our ban goes much further than other states' bans. In this age of concern over global warming pollutants and other emissions from fossil fuel plants, isn't our policy a little outdated -- maybe even a little absurd?LiNeBrEaKThe 2009 Legislature should put Minnesota back on track to true leadership on the climate change debate by allowing us to consider all carbon-free alternatives.LiNeBrEaKK. E. Roettgering, MahtomediSisters asked Mayosto staff hospitalLiNeBrEaKThe article in the Travel section regarding the interesting sites of Rochester was great ("Mayo Clinic makes this Minnesota city a magnet for millions," Dec. 21).LiNeBrEaKHowever, a clarification must be made. It said that after the 1883 tornado, the Mayo doctors started St. Mary's Hospital. It was, rather, the other way around. The Sisters of St. Francis of Rochester had aided in the care of the injured after the tornado. Afterward, Mother Alfred Moes, the foundress of the order, knew Rochester needed a hospital and approached Dr. William Mayo with the idea. If the sisters built a hospital, would he and his two sons, who were studying medicine out east, staff it? He agreed. And the hospital was built and opened on Sept. 30, 1889.LiNeBrEaKAfter many years, it is now part of the Mayo complex.LiNeBrEaKSister Zoa Braunwarth, OSF, West St. PaulIcy sidewalksremain until springLiNeBrEaKI always enjoy an account of the Pioneer Press Watchdog helping ordinary citizens ("That sidewalk ice can be a pain in your butt -- and your wallet," Jan. 1). I know it could be me in their shoes. I am concerned about sidewalk ice. I slip easily, but take a dog out for long walks twice each day. The ordinances and penalties noted by the Watchdog exist, but it is my experience, every year, that the city is unresponsive. I have never seen any results. Uncleared sidewalks remain that way until spring.LiNeBrEaKI politely report an address to the city at the correct number. Last year, I shared my list of addresses with the office of Council Member Pat Harris. Same results: zip, nada, nothing. The Watchdog ought to have reported an address. Then she would understand my frustration.LiNeBrEaKSteve Scholl, St. Paul	LETTERS and COMMENTS (92%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (90%); LEGISLATORS (78%); POWER PLANTS (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (76%); NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (76%); ORDINANCES (76%); GLOBAL WARMING (70%)  		MINNESOTA, USA (97%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	January 9, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 St. Paul Pioneer Press All Rights Reserved  	Pioneer Press  	MAYO CLINIC (55%)  																				
St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)  	January 5, 2009 Monday 	In danger and in the spotlight  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	643 words  	Jan. 5--THREATENED SPECIES -- including two that can be seen in our area -- grace pages of National Geographic.LiNeBrEaKIt's been a rough year for endangered species.LiNeBrEaKFirst, the polar bear was listed as threatened, becoming a sad symbol of global climate change.LiNeBrEaKMore recently, President George W. Bush's administration pushed through a revision of the Endangered Species Act that many groups believe severely impedes the benchmark law. LiNeBrEaKBut finally, endangered species are getting some prominent exposure this month as many of them -- including two from the St. Louis area -- appear in the January issue of National Geographic.LiNeBrEaKThe article, "Last One," by Verlyn Klinkenborg, features dramatic photos of more than two dozen threatened or endangered species -- everything from a grizzly bear to a Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit, which went extinct before publication.LiNeBrEaKAnna, a Mexican gray wolf at the Wild Canid Survival and Research Center in Eureka, is featured on page 103 of the magazine, and about a dozen American burying beetles from the St. Louis Zoo occupy a photo spread on pages 96 and 97.LiNeBrEaKThe animals were photographed almost two years ago by Joel Sartore, who has shot 25 National Geographic stories -- including six on endangered species.LiNeBrEaKSartore has been taking photos of the wolves at the Eureka sanctuary since the early 1990s and has a good relationship with the staff there, said Sue Linsdsey, the center's director.LiNeBrEaKAnna was an easy choice as a model. Not only is she one of the most genetically valuable wolves in the federal Mexican gray wolf reintroduction program, she's not terribly afraid of people, because she was hand-raised by the center's staff after her littermates died. "She's Little Miss Photogenic," Lindsey said. "She looks almost huggable."LiNeBrEaKSartore spent the better part of the day at the center in Eureka back in 2007 photographing Anna in her enclosure. When it began to snow, Sartore got the shot that landed Anna in National Geographic, where she represents her dwindling species.LiNeBrEaKMexican gray wolves were considered to be extinct in the wild until they were reintroduced in the Southwest in 1998.LiNeBrEaKThe Wild Canid center is the only facility in the United States to have a captive breeding program for both red and Mexican gray wolves. Currently located at Washington University's Tyson Research Facility, the center plans to relocate to newly acquired property in Jefferson County and is raising funds for the move.LiNeBrEaK"Seeing her in an article like this is just huge for us," Lindsey said.LiNeBrEaKOver at the zoo, Sartore photographed the beetles with the help of keeper Glenn Frei and Bob Merz, zoological manager of invertebrates.LiNeBrEaKMerz said the beetles were photographed as they crawled across a piece of glass. The beetle wranglers stood constant guard over the insects, which have steadily declined in population since at least the 1920s.LiNeBrEaK"The trick is knowing their behaviors," said Merz, director of the zoo's American burying beetle conservation center. "You've got to be able to move quickly, because they can helicopter right out of there."LiNeBrEaKLike Lindsey, Merz said that Sartore was incredibly patient and respectful of the fact he was working with rare animals.LiNeBrEaKHaving the beetles appear in National Geographic -- a magazine that's often collected and kept for years -- makes the experience quite meaningful, Merz said.LiNeBrEaK"It really reaffirms the work we're doing with endangered species and why they're so very important," he said.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	January 5, 2009 Monday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	your views  	LOCAL; Pg. B6  	1057 words  	Here's a solutionLiNeBrEaKRE "A BETTER idea," letter, Dec. 26: I totally agree with the writer, but I'd like to go even further. It's been obvious over the last months that regardless of $4-per-gallon gas, we're still going to drive our gas-guzzling SUVs, alone, whenever we want to. Now that a barrel of oil is down from $149 to $39, and gas has fallen to approximately $1. 50 per gallon, I propose a $1 per gallon tax.LiNeBrEaKI'm being facetious, of course. It would be the kiss of death for any politician to propose such lunacy. But just think of the infrastructure we could rebuild (all our aging bridges, most of all the Jordan), the third crossing we so badly need, the additional Midtown Tunnel tube, the Martin Luther King Highway connecting to Interstate 64, all without tolls. And that's just in Hampton Roads. Imagine what could be done statewide. LiNeBrEaKRandy HernandezLiNeBrEaKNorfolkLiNeBrEaKAnticipating tax hikesLiNeBrEaKCompanies are laying off workers, consumer spending is down, huge price discounts are offered to bolster holiday sales. What's causing this economic downturn?LiNeBrEaKSimple. It's like the squirrels storing up food for the winter. Consumers are storing up cash in anticipation of the long-proclaimed winter of tax increases promised by our congressional and senatorial leaders and our president-elect. It's true that our economy has slowed noticeably, but I believe many of the announced layoffs are nothing more than preemptive actions in anticipation of tax increases expected once Barack Obama takes office.LiNeBrEaKControlling of the economy lies in the hands of consumers like you and me. When we spend, the economy thrives; when government raises our taxes, we have less to spend. Higher taxes will lead to more job losses and less consumer spending and need I say more. Wake up, America.LiNeBrEaKTerrell BaardsgaardLiNeBrEaKVirginia BeachLiNeBrEaKHead in the sandLiNeBrEaKIt is alarming and morally unacceptable that risk analysis done by insurers and local governments reveal coastal communities are in danger of being washed away, yet coastal development is unabated.LiNeBrEaKInsurers use models that don't account for recent and projected melting of Greenland and Antarctica. North Carolina has the opportunity to incorporate sea level rise (and other related impacts from global warming such as stronger and larger storm surges and hurricanes) into new flooding maps. But it chooses not to, obscuring the real hazards that coastal citizens face.LiNeBrEaKWe must have transparency from insurers and local governments to ensure that coastal residents are prepared for the perils of living on a vulnerable coastline. If we do not act prudently, all of our homes and dreams could be washed away, just like that home on the Outer Banks.LiNeBrEaKToni RealeLiNeBrEaKSoutheast Coastal OrganizerLiNeBrEaKSouthern Alliance for Clean EnergyLiNeBrEaKCharleston, S.C.LiNeBrEaKSupport real choiceLiNeBrEaKRe "Ethical retreat on contraceptives," editorial, Jan. 1: In an expected downer for the new year, The Pilot's editorial against President Bush's wise promulgation of "right of conscience" legislation revealed the sad reality of the so-called pro-choice philosophy. Apparently the editorial board of The Pilot and those who might agree with them believe in the right of choice for everyone except those opposed to abortion on moral or religious grounds. The ability to choose not to participate in the procedures that end innocent life is apparently not worth protecting. I could not disagree more.LiNeBrEaKThe sad fact is that the ones who will not compromise on the issue of abortion are those on the side that promotes it. Since we cannot agree that abortions for the sake of gender selection are appalling, or that the refusal to give medical care to the baby born of a botched abortion ought to be illegal, persons of pro-life conscience must be given the right to exempt themselves from such procedures. To insist otherwise is to demand the violation of one person's "choice" in favor of another's.LiNeBrEaKOne can only hope that the president-elect will keep his promise to listen to all Americans in regard to this issue, reject the nefarious, unconstitutional FOCUS act and allow the rights of conscience to be exercised by the many involved in the medical field, not just doctors and nurses. After all, he claims to be "pro-choice."LiNeBrEaKRev. Msgr. Michael D.

One must wonder if the article was endorsed by the alcohol industry.LiNeBrEaKThis article is a slap in the face to all who have had a family member killed or injured by a drunken driver. In Virginia, sadly, alcohol-related crashes were up 49 percent in 2008 from the previous year. It is irresponsible to encourage subliminal messages that indicate that it's OK to drive after drinking.LiNeBrEaKFor the past 27 years, our group and others have raised awareness to the dangers of drinking and driving. We have tried in every way to separate the lethal mix of alcohol from the automobile. In fact, it is now socially unacceptable to drink and drive.LiNeBrEaKThere are many alternatives, including choosing a sober designated driver, calling a cab, hiring a limo or calling a business that will see that you and your car arrive home safely.LiNeBrEaKWe sincerely hope the next time we see a cocktail glass like the one in this article, with a car inside, there will be a bold-faced, black X in the middle of the glass.LiNeBrEaKLillian DeVennyLiNeBrEaKState PresidentLiNeBrEaKVirginians Opposing Drunk DrivingLiNeBrEaKNorfolkLiNeBrEaKWealthy public servantsLiNeBrEaKHow do people of modest means become wealthy when entering "public service"?

Guy Friddell, Larry Bonko, Lawrence Maddry, George McClelland, Dick Welsh, Turner Dozier, Kay McGraw, Richard Bayer, Ronald L.

The Yomiuri Shimbun (Japan)  	January 5, 2009 Monday 	Tax carrot eyed to spur small Tokyo firms to make energy-saving investment  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	479 words  	Jan. 5--TOKYO -- In a bid to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the capital, the Tokyo metropolitan government likely will introduce tax cuts from April for small and midsize companies that bring about energy savings through equipment and plant investment. LiNeBrEaKTokyo would become the first municipality to introduce such local corporate tax cuts -- expected to be in the region of 25 billion yen over five years -- to encourage firms to make their facilities environmentally friendly. Some observers said the move likely will spur other municipalities to take similar action.LiNeBrEaKWith a recession sweeping the nation, the metropolitan government also hopes this measure to combat global warming will make companies more willing to invest in new equipment and premises.LiNeBrEaKThe metropolitan government projects that about 40,000 of the 500,000 small and medium-size companies in the Tokyo metropolitan area would be eligible for such tax cuts.LiNeBrEaKCompanies that have switched to energy-saving power specifications on tool machinery or have installed equipment such as boilers, air conditioning or lighting systems that consume less heat or electricity, will be eligible for the tax cut.LiNeBrEaKUnder the plan, a company could halve the cost of its investment -- up to a ceiling of half the local corporate tax it is scheduled to pay.LiNeBrEaKFor example, if a firm scheduled to pay an annual total of 1 million yen in local corporate tax invested in energy-saving equipment worth 800,000 yen, half the amount of the investment -- 400,000 yen -- would be deducted, leaving it with a tax bill of 600,000 yen.LiNeBrEaKShould the firm invest in equipment worth the same amount or more than its total tax bill, it would pay half its scheduled corporate tax. For example, if the company paying 1 million yen in tax installed equipment worth 1. 2 million yen, a 500,000-yen tax saving ceiling would apply, despite the fact that half the investment cost would be 600,000 yen.LiNeBrEaKThe metropolitan government became the first in the nation to establish an ordinance that will make it obligatory from fiscal 2010 for reductions to be made in carbon dioxide emissions at the about 1,300 large industrial facilities in the capital.LiNeBrEaKThe tax cuts, however, could entice small and midsize companies not covered by the ordinance to invest in energy-saving equipment.LiNeBrEaKUnder the Kyoto Protocol, Japan is required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions between 2008 and 2012 by 6 percent from the 1990 levels.

Albuquerque Journal (New Mexico)  	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	Drier Climate On the Way For Southwest  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	586 words  	Jan. 4--Climate change is increasing the chances of severe and persistent drought in the Southwest, according to a new report from a panel of federal scientists.LiNeBrEaK"It's going to get drier," said Richard Seager, a climate researcher at Columbia University in New York.LiNeBrEaKThat means diminished water supplies, Seager said. LiNeBrEaKIt is possible that greenhouse-induced drying may have already begun, though the evidence is unclear, according to Seager, one of the report's authors. "We can't tell yet," Seager said in a telephone interview.LiNeBrEaKThe report, from the U.S. Geological Survey, is one in a series produced by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program. The program brings together teams of scientists to give government decision-makers their assessment of the latest science related to the way Earth's climate is changing.LiNeBrEaKThere is broad scientific agreement that human emissions of carbon dioxide from burning coal and oil are changing Earth's climate. While an overall planetary warming, often called "global warming," is the most notable effect, scientists say regional effects -- such as drought in the Southwest -- are likely to have the greatest effect on society.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to the problems of drought in the Southwest, according to the report, other problems faced by the United States could include:LiNeBrEaKn Increased emissions of methane in the arctic. The methane, created as organic matter decomposes, is trapped in the frozen soil and is released as the soil warms. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, and growth in emissions could create a feedback effect, speeding up global warming, according to the report.LiNeBrEaKn Rising sea levels.LiNeBrEaKn "Rapid and sustained" loss of arctic sea ice.LiNeBrEaKIn New Mexico, the data on long term warming is clear. The last 15 years have been warmer than the long-term average for the state, according to data from the Western Regional Climate Center in Reno, Nev., with nine of the 15 warmest years on record in the state falling during that span.LiNeBrEaKBut the question of whether climate change is already drying us out is less clear. After an extremely wet period, beginning in the 1970s, our climate began drying out in the late 1990s. Scientists are trying to determine whether the drying trend is the result of global warming or natural variability, Seager said.LiNeBrEaKEven without the effects of climate change, the Southwest is subject to "megadroughts" far more severe than anything experienced in the past century, including the Dust Bowl and the devastating drought that swept across New Mexico and Arizona in the 1950s, according to the new report.LiNeBrEaKScientists who use tree rings to study ancient droughts have seen evidence for repeated decadeslong droughts, which are possible even without the effects of climate change, noted Balaji Rajagopalan, a climate researcher at the University of Colorado who did not work on the new federal study.LiNeBrEaKRajagopalan noted that, while there is uncertainty about how large the effect of climate change will be here, the collision of a rapidly growing population and inevitable drought in the region is a problem no matter what global warming dishes out.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 	January 4, 2009 Sunday   Main Edition	OUR OPINIONS;  Nuke revival puts all risk on customers 	@ISSUE; Pg. 17A  	691 words  	While Georgia Power and other utilities eagerly advocate a "nuclear renaissance," their enthusiasm for building new plants doesn't extend to sharing the considerable financial risks involved. Nor have private investors flocked to put money in new nuclear plants.LiNeBrEaKTo the contrary, Georgia Power's proposal to build two reactors at its existing Vogtle plant on the Savannah River near Augusta calls for company ratepayers --- you and me and anybody else who pays an electric bill to Georgia Power --- to bear almost all the considerable risk while making sure its stockholders and private investors bear almost no risk at all. LiNeBrEaKIf the cost of the project soars, or if the project is abandoned for some reason after billions are invested, ratepayers will be stuck with the entire bill and Georgia Power will walk off scot-free.LiNeBrEaKAnd with Georgia Power's share of the project already estimated at $6. 4 billion for just 45 percent of the plant output, that potential exposure is very large.LiNeBrEaKNobody, not even Georgia Power officials, speaks with any confidence in those cost estimates, and for good reason. The "new generation" reactors coming on line may be better engineered than their predecessors, and the threat of global warming has given nuclear energy an environmental sheen of green. But the economics, even with lucrative federal subsidies, remain uncertain.LiNeBrEaKIn Finland, the first new reactor built in Europe in 20 years is already three years behind schedule and 50 percent over budget. A little closer to home, the Tennessee Valley Authority had to more than double its cost estimate for two new Westinghouse AP1000 reactors --- the same untested reactors that Georgia Power proposes to build --- to as high as $17 billion.LiNeBrEaKIn Europe, the delays and cost overruns have been blamed in part on the fact that nuclear construction, management and production skills have atrophied after a generation of disuse. The same would be true here in the United States. LiNeBrEaK"This dramatic decline in the domestic supply chain is clearly having an effect," the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission told The Wall Street Journal last spring. "The global supply chain is stretched, if not to the breaking point, at least to the tipping point."LiNeBrEaKFor example, only one company in the world, Japan Steel Works Ltd., is capable of manufacturing the foot-thick reactor vessel needed in most designs, and the company is rushing to expand production from five vessels a year to 12 by 2012. That sounds reassuring until you realize that license applications for more than 30 new reactor units have been filed here in the United States alone, with more coming.LiNeBrEaKCompounding the problem, no AP1000 reactor has yet been built for commercial service, and its design is still being finalized with federal regulators. Yet Georgia Power is pressing the Public Service Commission to act by March to approve construction and financing of two such units.LiNeBrEaKUnder the company's proposal, ratepayers would have to start paying for the units immediately, long before they were actually built and producing power. Ratepayers would also bear most of the risks if anything went wrong.LiNeBrEaKThe PSC's advocacy staff has recommended that the commission reject that financing plan, arguing that Georgia Power and its stockholders should share some of the risk with the company's customers, in part to ensure that Georgia Power has incentive to keep costs low. That seems reasonable, logical, even necessary. If the company doesn't have faith that it can bring the project on line at a reasonable cost, it shouldn't push that risk onto ratepayers.LiNeBrEaKAnd yet that's the pattern everywhere. Utilities and private investors just aren't willing to put their own money at risk. Ratepayers' money, yes --- investors' money, no.LiNeBrEaK"No private-sector entity is investing in or proposing to invest in a new nuclear plant without direct or indirect support from the public," PSC Utility Finance Director Tom Newsome told the commission in written testimony.LiNeBrEaKSomething's not right about that.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 	January 4, 2009 Sunday   Online Edition	Jay Bookman;  Nuke revival puts all risk on customers 		705 words  	Sunday, January 4, 2009, 06: 47 AMLiNeBrEaKWhile Georgia Power and other utilities eagerly advocate a "nuclear renaissance," their enthusiasm for building new plants doesn't extend to sharing the considerable financial risks involved. Nor have private investors flocked to put money in new nuclear plants.LiNeBrEaKTo the contrary, Georgia Power's proposal to build two reactors at its existing Vogtle plant on the Savannah River near Augusta calls for company ratepayers ---- you and me and anybody else who pays an electric bill to Georgia Power ---- to bear almost all the considerable risk while making sure its stockholders and private investors bear almost no risk at all. LiNeBrEaKIf the cost of the project soars, or if the project is abandoned for some reason after billions are invested, ratepayers will be stuck with the entire bill and Georgia Power will walk off scot-free.LiNeBrEaKAnd with Georgia Power's share of the project already estimated atLiNeBrEaK$6. 4 billion for just 45 percent of the plant output, that potential exposure is very large.LiNeBrEaKNobody, not even Georgia Power officials, speaks with any confidence in those cost estimates, and for good reason. The "new generation" reactors coming on line may be better engineered than their predecessors, and the threat of global warming has given nuclear energy an environmental sheen of green. But the economics, even with lucrative federal subsidies, remain uncertain.LiNeBrEaKIn Finland, the first new reactor built in Europe in 20 years is already three years behind schedule and 50 percent over budget. A little closer to home, the Tennessee Valley Authority had to more than double its cost estimate for two new Westinghouse AP1000 reactors ---- the same untested reactors that Georgia Power proposes to build ---- to as high as $17 billion.LiNeBrEaKIn Europe, the delays and cost overruns have been blamed in part on the fact that nuclear construction, management and production skills have atrophied after a generation of disuse. The same would be true here in the United States.LiNeBrEaK"This dramatic decline in the domestic supply chain is clearly having an effect," the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission told The Wall Street Journal last spring. "The global supply chain is stretched, if not to the breaking point, at least to the tipping point."LiNeBrEaKFor example, only one company in the world, Japan Steel Works Ltd., is capable of manufacturing the foot-thick reactor vessel needed in most designs, and the company is rushing to expand production from five vessels a year to 12 by 2012.

The Charlotte Observer (North Carolina)  	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	Forging next nuclear age: Ellen Ruff is in charge of Duke Energy's first new nuclear plant in 20 years.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1217 words  	Jan. 4--Ellen Ruff has spent about half her life working for Duke Energy.LiNeBrEaKAnd now, the 60-year-old has a new assignment. She is Duke's first president of nuclear generation.LiNeBrEaKTopping her to-do list is shepherding the Charlotte company's plans for the $18 billion William States Lee III plant near Gaffney, S.C., its first new nuclear plant in two decades. Duke has said it may look for partners to help with the cost.LiNeBrEaKRuff previously worked as head of Duke Energy Carolinas since 2006. Her current assignment comes during great change for the industry, amid intense focus on carbon dioxide emissions, climate change, energy efficiency and a new administration coming to Washington. She reports directly to Duke CEO Jim Rogers now.LiNeBrEaKThere's also been much criticism over Duke's save-a-watt proposal to conserve energy by offering financial incentives to encourage customers to buy energy efficient upgrades for homes and businesses. All customers would pay for the program through their monthly bills, although critics charged that Duke would make too much money on the program. LiNeBrEaKRuff is also a board member of the United Way of Central Carolinas, which has seen its share of controversy following the firing of its CEO last year after disclosures of a lucrative pension deal.LiNeBrEaKA lawyer and Connecticut native, Ruff recently talked with the Observer about the industry and her new responsibilities. She spoke shortly before Duke announced it was freezing salaries this year for about half of its 18,000 workers.LiNeBrEaKQuestions and answers have been edited for brevity and clarity:LiNeBrEaKQ. Tell me about your new job and your main goals for it.LiNeBrEaKIt's all about nuclear. It's about refocusing on nuclear development generally, and specifically in the Southeast. It's a rising cost environment, and we are very anxious to find a way to develop nuclear in terms of being a clean source of energy, and non-carbon emitting.LiNeBrEaKSecondly, we're going to have reliable, affordable source of generation for our customers, because at the end of the day, this is about our customers, and having a source of generation there for them and finding a way to build nuclear in the most cost-effective way.LiNeBrEaKWe'd like legislation that would further promote a concept to make nuclear generation affordable and easy to do in a joint venture structure. The goal will be outreach, talking to stakeholders that include regulators and legislators, and first of all talking to our sister utilities about what goals they have and what is mutually beneficial for the companies and the customers.LiNeBrEaKQ. What is the status of Duke's efforts to share costs on the Lee plant?LiNeBrEaKWe have filed for a federal loan guarantee for Lee. In terms of partners, we don't have any now. We're just beginning.LiNeBrEaKQ. Can Duke go it alone on Lee if you wind up with no partners?LiNeBrEaKWe certainly are prepared for that. The license application has that in mind, and we will be prepared for Plan B if that's the direction we need to go. Because primary in our obligation is to have reliable, low-cost electricity available and that includes Lee. We will always have a plan to get there. To be successful with regional generation it will have to be collaborative in some form.LiNeBrEaKQ. What is the status of save-a-watt, and why has there been resistance to it?LiNeBrEaKWe're waiting for decisions from our regulatory commissions. We have customers that are asking for those products to be available so we're hopeful that we'll have a decision soon.LiNeBrEaKI wouldn't say it's a resistance to the program. There's huge support for energy efficiency as a component of the portfolio. The question is how do we price it. And I think 90 percent of the discussion around save-a-watt has been around the pricing mechanism that we proposed.LiNeBrEaKIf we were a grocery store selling products, the concept of us being paid for selling less of a product is an unusual one. Save-a-watt is a very important part of the new paradigm going forward.LiNeBrEaKQ. How do you see the change in administration impacting your industry?LiNeBrEaKEvery one of the new appointees in the Cabinet has talked about climate change. (Duke CEO) Jim Rogers has been out front in talking about the need to set the rules of the road for carbon and I think that's going to happen.LiNeBrEaKClimate change today is a reality, whether we have legislation in the first or second 100 days. I think it's been accepted as a reality by the public and we are going to find a way to address it, and the new administration has been very clear we will do that.LiNeBrEaKQ. What's your overall take on the economy?LiNeBrEaKIt's hard times. I have three children, 25, 23 and 19, and I think it's an experience for them. It's a hard time to get jobs, unemployment appears to be rising, budget constraints are being discussed in regards to state budgets. I'm on the N.C. economic development board. That's a subject of discussion, how are we going to move to Plan B in this economy and still weather the storm and make progress.LiNeBrEaKFor us, we still have to maintain the long view, because so much of what we do is the long view. Part of my role in this area is exactly that, to take those steps forward on nuclear. But this company, in my 30 years, Duke has always been focused on the cost containment issues.LiNeBrEaKThere's always a concerted effort on cost control, whether there are signs of a recession or not. When it first occurred, we drew down on our line of credit. We drew a billion dollars to ensure our liquidity and our ability to be in the market.LiNeBrEaKQ. You've spent about 30 years at Duke. To what do you attribute your longevity?LiNeBrEaKDuke's motto when I came to work was citizenship and service. And throughout the 30 years, I've seen that commitment from this company and seen its importance to the region. On an individual basis for me, it was an opportunity to work on incredible complex issues but one that is ultimately important to everyone you meet in the grocery store.LiNeBrEaKWhat I have loved the most about this last job and going forward is the interaction with people. When you open yourself up for that, it is absolutely terrific.LiNeBrEaKQ. As a United Way board member, how do you restore public confidence in the agency?LiNeBrEaKI think United Way has taken the steps, formed the independent committee to look at both the internal structure and the governance structure related to United Way. It was a learning experience for many of us (on the board) but I think we came out on the other side knowing more about the importance of being transparent because it is certainly critical to restore that confidence. I think we did the right thing in taking the steps to restore the transparency.LiNeBrEaKQ. Tell me something about yourself outside of work that would surprise people who know you?LiNeBrEaKMy husband's a vegetarian so I'm a very good vegetarian cook. I had about 17 people for Thanksgiving, and said to my middle son, "You know I don't like cooking meat much anymore. He said, I knew it, you're going to become like Dad."

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	Bush's global warming moves create 2 scenarios for Obama  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	864 words  	WASHINGTON _ President George W. Bush could be forcing President-elect Barack Obama to act almost immediately to curb global warming, after years of the Bush administration fighting attempts to crack down on greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKOr, depending on which interpretation prevails, Bush could be giving his successor much-needed breathing room on a volatile issue.LiNeBrEaKIn its final weeks, the Bush administration has moved to close what it calls "back doors" to regulating carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. It barred the Environmental Protection Agency from considering the effects of global warming on protected species. And it excluded carbon dioxide from a list of pollutants the EPA regulates under the Clean Air Act. LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists call the moves a last-minute attempt to block speedy, executive action by the president's successor on climate change, an issue that Obama calls a top concern. But they say it could backfire, by prompting lawsuits and fueling fights over coal-fired power plants that the new administration would need to resolve quickly.LiNeBrEaKObama "now has to clean up a mess," said David Bookbinder, chief climate counsel for the Sierra Club, which has challenged the EPA over the Clean Air Act decision and plans to sue to block it. "They're forcing him to act sooner than he otherwise might have."LiNeBrEaKYet energy industry lobbyists predict the challenges will fail. They say the Bush administration's actions give Obama time and political cover to take a more deliberative approach to emissions regulation and avoid overly broad, overly swift rules that could slow construction projects for schools and businesses, not just power plants.LiNeBrEaK"I'm quite confident that the Obama administration will have no interest in coming in and immediately reversing" the decisions, said Jeffrey Holmstead, a former EPA clean air administrator who now represents energy industry clients at the lobbying firm Bracewell and Giuliani in Washington.LiNeBrEaKUnderlying the debate is the issue of how the federal government should reduce America's emissions of the gases scientists blame for global warming, including carbon dioxide. Congress has long debated, but never approved, a so-called cap-and-trade system to limit carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKFrustrated, environmental groups have looked for other ways to fight global warming. They have pressed to list the polar bear, whose habitat has dwindled as arctic ice melts, as a threatened species. The Interior Department consented this summer, but later it declared that any protection for the bears under the Endangered Species Act did not extend to regulating greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups also sued to force the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court ruled the EPA had the power to do that, but administration officials have declined to exercise it.LiNeBrEaKEPA Administrator Stephen Johnson issued a memo in late December _ as part of a review for a proposed coal-fired power plant expansion in Utah _ that excludes carbon dioxide from the list of pollutants the government must regulate under the Clean Air Act when approving construction projects.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists called the memo a gift to the coal industry and utilities.LiNeBrEaK"This is a desperate attempt to interfere with the Obama administration's ability to deal with greenhouse gases from power plants," said John Walke, a former EPA attorney who is now clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council.LiNeBrEaKIndustry lobbyists say the memo leaves the door open for Obama to regulate carbon dioxide eventually through the EPA and that it gives him time to solve a wider problem. A broad rule, they say, risks lumping school expansions, office construction and even some home building into the same regulatory process a power plant would face.LiNeBrEaKThe memo allows Obama's team time to solve those issues, Holmstead maintains, so "they don't sweep in hundreds of thousands of small building projects around the country."LiNeBrEaKObama vows to push aggressively for a cap-and-trade bill as president. Under this method of trading, overall air quality goals are set by the government, and individual facilities such as power plants are given allowances for what they can emit. Facilities that pollute less than they are permitted to can trade a share of their allowance to others that pollute more.LiNeBrEaKAnd the president-elect's top energy adviser promised during the campaign that Obama would move to regulate carbon under the Clean Air Act within 18 months of taking office.LiNeBrEaKNow, environmentalists say, Bush has put pressure on Obama to act sooner or risk watching states approve new power plants without regard to carbon emissions. Energy companies have taken quick notice of the EPA memo: Duke Energy recently cited it in a court filing supporting its bid to build a new coal-fired plant in Indiana.

Dayton Daily News (Ohio) 	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	Read it and weep  	LOCAL; Pg. A11  	2586 words  	Job losses, plummeting housing values and shaky consumer confidence across the nation are translating into a budget nightmare for local school and government officials. Here is a synopsis of some of the changes in store that could affect you in 2009.LiNeBrEaKFEDERAL GOVERNMENT:LiNeBrEaK* Budget outlook: Last year's $700 billion federal bailout of financial institutions, which included a chunk later used to help out the U.S. domestic auto industry, is just the beginning. President-elect Barack Obama has yet to reveal his budgetary priorities, but Congress is working to have a massive economic stimulus package aimed at boosting infrastructure and providing jobs ready to sign on Jan. 20 - inauguration day. And states are asking the federal government for billions in aid to help shore up giant budget gaps.LiNeBrEaK* What will it mean to you? Even as you read this, interest groups and local governments are jockeying for a piece of that stimulus bill. States in particular are readying infrastructure projects that they can begin work on quickly. In the short term, Obama's budget will aim to fix the nation's struggling economy. In the long term, he's hoping to reform the nation's health care system, create so-called green jobs and implement legislation aimed at curbing global warming. The question, of course, is how will he pay for this?  LiNeBrEaK* So, how will he pay for it? Obama has estimated that significant cost savings - eventually - will come through ending the war in Iraq. But for now, the federal government's reaction to strapped county and state governments has been to spend more in hopes of getting them out of this mess. Needless to say, fiscal conservatives are among those who are less than pleased with this. Obama has said he hopes to make budget cuts and eliminate unnecessary programs, but priority one will be fixing the mammoth economic mess.LiNeBrEaK* Who is responsible for the mess?LiNeBrEaKDepends on your perspective. Democrats say President Bush's two terms, which included a war and a financial meltdown, was disastrous and put them in the untenable position. Republicans say that Democrats' response - see the bailout bill referenced above - will do nothing but make the situation worse.LiNeBrEaK* Key dates: Jan. 6: Congress convenes; Jan. 20: Obama's inauguration; Feb. 2: Deadline for Obama to submit his first budget to Congress; April 15: Target date for Congress to approve budget resolution. Congress rarely meets this deadline.LiNeBrEaKJESSICA WEHRMANLiNeBrEaKSTATE GOVERNMENTLiNeBrEaK* Budget outlook: It's probably best summed up this way: doom and gloom. Gov. Ted Strickland announced last month that state officials are looking at a $640 million shortfall for the current fiscal year and as much as a $7. 3 billionLiNeBrEaKfunding gap for the upcoming two-year budget. With the economy circling the drain, state income tax and sales tax revenues aren't meeting expectations, even after those expectations were revised downward. Unemployment is at 7. 3 percent, up from 5. 7 percent a year ago and well above the national average of 6. 7 percent. When people have less income, they spend less, which puts pressure on the state programs that depend on that tax revenue.LiNeBrEaK* What will it mean to you? While cities plow streets and pick up garbage, state government does a lot of "behind the scenes" work that Ohioans may take for granted. For instance, state government runs 74 parks, keeps 51,000 prisoners locked up, provides funding for 600-plus local school districts, inspects nursing homes so they can receive federal funding, immunizes low-income children against deadly diseases, hands out $113. 5 million in unemployment checks per month, distributes food stamps to 1. 2 million Ohioans each month, runs a health care insurance program for 1. 76 million Ohioans, and plows, paves and patrols state highways. Virtually all of these departments would face cuts, particularly under a doomsday scenario unveiled by the Strickland administration last month. The 13-page document detailed what $7. 3 billion in budget cuts would look like and it wasn't pretty. Six adult prisons and three juvenile corrections facilities would close, as would some state parks; funding to local school districts would drop so drastically some of them would be unable to make payroll; the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services would have to cut back on child care subsidies offered to parents on welfare, eliminating service to as many as 56,000 children; food safety inspection staff would be reduced by 40 percent, and nursing home inspections would be curtailed, making it difficult for some homes to get Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement.LiNeBrEaK* Can the federal government help? Maybe. Strickland is helping lead the charge among governors pressing the incoming Obama administration for $250 billion to the states for food stamps and Medicaid. States have also identified some $250 billion in road, bridge, sewer and other infrastructure projects. In early December, Strickland asked federal officials for $5 billion to tide Ohio over through the economic slump. However, even if the federal government comes through with the money, Ohio's budget troubles will likely continue, Strickland says. As for any tax increases, Strickland has so far ruled them out, and the Ohio Senate is still controlled by anti-tax Republicans.LiNeBrEaK* Who is responsible for the mess? Whoever is the executive in charge during an economic crisis usually gets the blame, although the national downturn is clearly putting pressure on the state budget. Ohio's two workhorse taxes -LiNeBrEaKsales and income - are both bringing in less thanLiNeBrEaKexpected. The state will see $491 million less in sales tax revenues in fiscal year 2010 than it did in fiscal year 2008, which would mark the first two-year decline in sales taxes since 1950.LiNeBrEaK* Key dates: Strickland is expected to introduce his proposed two-year budget in February and lawmakers must adopt a version of the budget by June 30, when the state's fiscal year ends. The governor has "line-item" veto power on a budgetLiNeBrEaKbill, allowing him to strike out parts that he doesn't like without vetoing the entire bill. LAURA A. BISCHOFF AND WILLIAM HERSHEY LiNeBrEaKLOCAL GOVERNMENTSLiNeBrEaKMontgomery CountyLiNeBrEaK* Budget outlook: Dim and could get worse. The county's $157. 9 million 2009 general fund budget contains $10 million in cuts to offset a projected deficit. Officials fear they'll have to slice even more if revenues from the state are cut. The county balanced the budget with an across-the-board 3 percent cut, layoffs, reductions by attrition, closing Memorial Hall,LiNeBrEaKeliminating park recreation programs, and curtailing Courthouse Square programs. Administrator Deborah Feldman warns that revenues will remain flat through 2012 and that the county could need to start looking at cutting additional programs that are not mandated.LiNeBrEaK* What will it mean to you? The most obvious impact will be on people who use the county's recreation programs, or those who have held events at Memorial Hall. Deeper cuts to an array of essential services will affect everyone to some degree.LiNeBrEaK* Who is responsible for the mess? The recession has exacerbated long-term problems with sales tax revenues, which make up about 40 percent of general fund revenues, and have been flat since 2000. Flat or declining revenues from investments, property taxes and fees related to property sales also figure in.LiNeBrEaK* Key dates: The county budget is in place, butLiNeBrEaKofficials are watching to see what impacts the state budget cuts will have. Last year, Gov. Ted Strickland closed a $733 million hole in the operating budget by shutting down two mental hospitals, including Twin Valley Behavioral Healthcare in Dayton. The prospect of deep cuts in state programs have local officials on edge. LYNN HULSEYLiNeBrEaKNORTH MIAMI VALLEYLiNeBrEaK* Budget outlook: For 2009 it's concerning, but 2010 looks downright scary. "That's when the worst of it is supposed to be," Huber Heights City Manager Eileen Wilson Bensen said. "Many of the tough decisions made now will be in anticipation of 2010." Huber Heights cut $1. 6 million from its budget to accommodate a .25 percent local income tax reduction passed in November without layoffs or service cuts, Bensen said. To counter an additional revenue loss in 2009, it contracted with the Regional Income Tax Authority and will lay off five people in its city income tax department. Meanwhile, Trotwood has been slashing its budget each of the past few years.LiNeBrEaK* What will it mean to you? In Tipp City, a twice-defeated .25 percent city income tax increase means the city won't pave its streets in 2009 - for the second year in a row - and Councilman George Lovett said "draconian" cuts may be needed to balance the budget. In December, the city council had to give up almost $1 million in grant funding because of an inability to guarantee the granting agencies it could come up with required matching funds.LiNeBrEaK* Who is responsible for the mess? Foreclosures, falling property values and unemployment have taken a toll in places like Trotwood, where a November defeat of a new street levy and another street levy renewal will mean layoffs in the street department. Further revenue losses could trigger more layoffs in other departments. For most everybody it's a similar target: the overall economy. "I think we have a really rough road ahead of us in 2009," Tipp City Mayor Tim Evans said.LiNeBrEaK* Key dates: Huber Heights has been at impasse with its firefighters union since Dec. 22, and expects to begin negotiating with three police department bargaining units by August. Bensen anticipates those negotiations to be challenging. "We don't ever want to get to the point of wage concessions," she said. "But at some point, our financial situation could confront employees' legitimate needs."LiNeBrEaKNANCY BOWMAN AND VALRYN WARRENLiNeBrEaKSOUTH MIAMI VALLEYLiNeBrEaK* Budget Outlook: Things are tight everywhere, but levy failures in Springboro have the school district desperate for funds, while the closing of the Dayton area's last General Motors plant has the city of Moraine dipping into its reserves. Springboro has already cut $3. 5 million from the district operating budget, and school officials say they could be forced to further slash expenses if they can't win voter approval of an operating levy in 2009. The district's five-year forecast predicts a $14 million deficit by the 2011/2012 school year. In Moraine, and really throughout the region, the fallout from the 1,100 jobs that disappeared with the shuttering of the Moraine GM truck plant will be felt for many years to come.LiNeBrEaK* What will it mean to you? In Springboro, class sizes have grown to 30 or more students across the district. The district has stopped hiring teachers, cut back on supplies, curtailed professional training and laid off 10 custodians. In Moraine, the city bought some time by putting away cash in reserve - about $27 million - but it won't be long until the loss of $3 million annually in city income taxes puts a chokehold on the budget. The city is actively pursuing a tenant or tenants to occupy the 4 million square foot GM facility, now empty.LiNeBrEaK* Who is responsible for the mess? In Springboro, it might be easy to say the voters, but uncertain economic times have made levies a crapshoot in just about every community. The forces that have pushed American car makers to the edge - Wall Street, rising fuel prices, the housing sector meltdown, credit freeze - have helped to write the final chapter of Dayton as a General Motors town. LiNeBrEaK* Key dates: Expect Springboro to seek another levy in May; if it's defeated, officials say the district could cut busing to the state minimum, forcing every student within two miles of their school to walk or find other transportation.LiNeBrEaKDOUG PAGE AND CHRIS MAGANLiNeBrEaKDAYTON D Budget B outlook: The city is facing a $$ 13 million deficit for its $167 million 2009 2 general fund budget, and City Manager M Rashad Young says up to 40 employees e may be laid off. The city's total t work force will be slashed by 181 staff s positions. But some of those positions p are vacant, and 88 employees have h agreed to buyout deals with an average a payout of $11,500. These cuts, however h , are on top of annual 2 percent workforce w reductions since 2004.LiNeBrEaK* * What will it mean to you? Cutbacks in i city services. Recreational opportunities t will decrease, as will the maintenance n of city parks and the mowing of vacant v lots. For example, under proposed p city cuts only 17 of the city's 43 4 ball fields would be maintained and in i playable condition, according to the city c . The Riverbend Art Center will be closed c and maintenance of city facilities could c be contracted out. No police recruits r will likely be trained in 2009, and a Young is recommending a restructuring t of the fire department that includes i the demotion of 10 district chiefs c .LiNeBrEaK* * Who is responsible for the mess?LiNeBrEaKSaid S Deputy City Manager Stanley Earley E : "Regional employment for the Dayton D metro area has declined by about a 10 percent since 2000 - from approximately a 440,000 to 400,000 - even e before the most recent round of layoffs l . So the issues we are seeing now result largely from longer, broader trends and are not a sudden phenomenon."LiNeBrEaK* Key dates: The date for formal 2009 budget approval by Dayton City Commission vote is not set, in fact because of the relationship between the city charter and state law, that can't happen until late February. But an informal go-ahead is expected within 10 days. The city monitors budget activity on an ongoing basis and updates are presented to the commission and staff monthly.LiNeBrEaKKEN MCCALLLiNeBrEaKLOCAL SCHOOLSLiNeBrEaK* Budget outlook: Worrisome. State budget woes are a huge concern for local school districts, who fear the state will cut their per-pupil funding for the first time. State support accounts for 38 percent to 52 percent of every local district's operating budget. Under the state's doomsday scenario, which calls for 25 percent cuts, $2 billion would be trimmed from the Ohio Department of Education, bumping state support back to 2001 funding levels. School districts that have recently defeated operating levies and already face cuts, such as Springboro and Trotwood, would be hurt worst. But even Dayton City Schools, which passed a new 4. 9-mill operating levy and stands to gain $9. 3 million this year, would lose all that money and more with just a 10 percent cut in state funding.LiNeBrEaK* What will it mean to you? School districts say their top priority will be saving instructional programming, with athletic programs, non-instructional personnel and transportation services to be targeted first. But some school districts already have eliminated what they can in those areas. With teacher and staffing salaries accounting for about 80 percent of district operating expenses, a state cut of 25 percent would mean fewer teachers and larger class sizes in many districts.LiNeBrEaK* Who is responsible for the mess? Local educators blame the declining economy, the resulting drop in state tax revenues and the state's outmoded school funding formula, which relies heavily on local operating levies that must be renewed by voters every three to five years. With today's economy, districts increasingly have trouble passing levies. Four times from 1997 to 2002, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled the state's school funding mechanism unconstitutional, but state legislators and the governor's office have put off major reform.LiNeBrEaK* Key dates: The first week of February, when Strickland submits his two-year budget request, and whenever Ohio learns whether the state will get federal aid.LiNeBrEaKJIM DEBROSSE	US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (89%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (89%); CREDIT CRISIS (89%); ECONOMIC NEWS (89%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (89%); BUDGET (89%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (89%); BAILOUTS (89%); CONSUMER CONFIDENCE (78%); APPROPRIATIONS (78%); SALES TAX (78%); LEGISLATION (77%); IRAQ WAR (77%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (76%); 2008 ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN (75%); TAXES and TAXATION (73%); APPROVALS (73%); US PRESIDENTS (71%); BANKING and FINANCE (71%); INFRASTRUCTURE (71%); BANK FAILURES (71%); INCOME TAX (60%); GLOBAL WARMING (51%); HEALTH CARE REFORM (51%); US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009 (90%); OBAMA'S FIRST 100 DAYS (89%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (76%); TROUBLED ASSET RELIEF PROGRAM (76%)  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); GEORGE W BUSH (52%); TED STRICKLAND (50%)  	OHIO, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (92%); IRAQ (79%)  	January 8, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Dayton Newspapers, Inc.   			...and and si six adult dult prisons and and th three juvenile enil corrections orrections facilities facilities i would would close lose. ...nursing home inspections would be cut back, making it difficult for some homes to get Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement...

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	January 4, 2009 Sunday   ALL S EDITION	How to turn your office green  	BUSINESS; Pg. G3  	425 words  	Everyone loves the idea of going green. But it can be difficult to figure out where to start in the workplace. If you want to start the new year with a green effort in your office, here are ways to make the transition easier. LiNeBrEaK-- Make it a daily habit. Start small. "The best way to start is to reduce all the waste that involves paper, plastic or petro," said Tim Sanders, author of "Saving the World at Work."LiNeBrEaKWhen using paper, print on both sides.LiNeBrEaKSharing a document? Use a USB drive or e-mail a copy rather than printing. Instead of bottled water, install a water filter on the office kitchen sink.LiNeBrEaKTurn off as many machines as possible each night when you go home.LiNeBrEaK-- Recruit others to join your effort.LiNeBrEaKMake signs that say "Think Before You Print" and post them near office printers. Leave your name and e-mail in case anyone has a question.LiNeBrEaKChange your e-mail signature to include a line that discourages people from printing out e-mails.LiNeBrEaKIf you send PDFs, consider running them through greenpdf.com, which adds a pop-up box advising recipients not to print out the documents unless necessary.LiNeBrEaK"Talk to your friends at work, especially those in facilities, operations, legal, marketing or sales," said Sanders.LiNeBrEaKIt can take time to get more people on board, but chatting about the effort can help you "build a network of greenies around the company."LiNeBrEaK-- Share the savings.LiNeBrEaKTeam up with a colleague in finance to help calculate the monetary savings the company will realize from the waste-reduction efforts.LiNeBrEaKPresent the figures to your manager, and ask that the results be shared companywide. Getting the word out will help spread the value of being green.LiNeBrEaK"You'll be surprised how relevant this might be during these tough economic times," Sanders said. Your effort also could earn "unique recognition for making a difference as you help the company save a dollar."LiNeBrEaK-- Bottom up, top down -- either works. Most successful efforts employ managers and subordinates, said Rick Row, executive director of the nonprofit Sustainable Silicon Valley.LiNeBrEaK"At all levels, there is growing concern that we do something about global warming and other environmental issues," he says.LiNeBrEaKSo, take advantage of that fact, and approach everyone, from the janitor to the CEO. A "passion for greening" is the only prerequisite anyone needs in order to get involved, Row said.LiNeBrEaK-- Have a good time. At TRIRIGA, an enterprise software company in Las Vegas, visitors looking for Styrofoam or paper cups find none. Instead, they can take their pick from a funky assortment of mugs and china cups.

The Hawk Eye (Burlington, Iowa)  	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	The Hawk Eye, Burlington, Iowa, John Van Nostrand column: A new secretary; another governor  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	656 words  	Jan. 4--President-elect Barack Obama's selection of Vilsack, the two-term (1998-2006) Iowa governor, to lead the U.S. Department of Agriculture is as safe and sound as betting an Illinois governor might be corrupt.LiNeBrEaKVilsack's nomination also marks the third, non-farming Midwestern governor in a row -- first Nebraska's Johanns, then North Dakota's Shafer -- to be secretary of agriculture. All are more bank managers than ag innovators. LiNeBrEaKIndeed, Vilsack is a trial lawyer by training who came to Iowa for love, then got into politics. My only encounter with him came on a sunny, 1997 September day when we both addressed an Iowa Farmers Union meeting. Vilsack was cruising for ag endorsements to boost his bid to succeed then-retiring Gov. For Life, Republican and farmer, Terry Branstad.LiNeBrEaKAs Vilsack spoke, I asked his lone aide if the senator was running as an independent.LiNeBrEaKWhy?LiNeBrEaKWell, I replied, his campaign literature didn't identify him as either a Republican or a Democrat. So, he must be running either as an independent or a chicken, right -- too scared to list his party affiliation. (The aide said "Democrat," then left in a huff.)LiNeBrEaKAs a born-and-baptized middle-of-the-roader, his subsequent election didn't answer my question: he backed just about every idea Big Ag brought to Iowa's golden-domed statehouse even as he publicly worried about rural sustainability, global warming and natural resource conservation.LiNeBrEaKAnd he didn't do any of it half-heartedly. He was an all-in supporter of big biotech, big pig, big biofuels and often offered big state money to underwrite bio-ventures. His gung-ho boosterism of "pharming" earned him the Biotechnology Industry Organization's "Governor of the Year" award in 2001.LiNeBrEaKTo sustainable and organic farm and food backers, that was akin to Attila the Hun anointing Vilsack "Pillager of the Year." To the then-growing movement, it was, and remains, an unforgivable wrong step in the wrong direction for the governor of one of America's leading food states.LiNeBrEaKIt wasn't the wrong step, however, if you had bigger political ambitions, and Vilsack clearly did. Since Iowa has no term limits on its governor, Vilsack could have stayed as long as voters would have him. (His two predecessors, kindly Robert Ray and the forever-boyish Branstad, hung around for 14 and 16 years, respectively.)LiNeBrEaKBut the Potomac bug bit Vilsack, and he left to run for the White House despite an already-crowded field of big-- really big -- hitters. It was a brief affliction whose cure, a steamroller named Barack Obama, pushed him back into private citizenship and public law.LiNeBrEaKThen Obama called Dec. 17, and the ex-gov is now the secretary-to-be. His confirmation, an almost certain 90-something-to-zero slam dunk, will be squired through the Senate by Ag Committee chair Tom Harkin, a fellow Democrat and fellow Iowan.LiNeBrEaKOnce installed, though, Vilsack will face two paths to posterity. If he still burns with ambition, he'll take the smooth, well-marked path paved by Big Ag, Big Bio and Big Money because it favors a higher profile and higher office.LiNeBrEaKIf, however, he views his tenure at USDA as the climax of his political career, he might see farmers and food as equals and place both ahead of agbiz's ceaseless quest for profit and unending drive to use government to undermine competition and quality.LiNeBrEaKThat's the path 90 percent of all food producers -- and 100 percent of all consumers -- want and need Vilsack to take. What remains to be seen is whether he is an independent leader or just another agbiz chicken.

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	'Greenland and the polar ice cap are melting' Commentary  	D; Pg. 3D  	1291 words  	Constant Californian writes to respond to my piece on the global cooling of 2008:LiNeBrEaK"You may be aware of Bjorn Lomborg, a Danish scientist who was long skeptical of global warming," he writes. "He is not anymore. His complaint is with what he perceives as hysteria, and unsound policy. I wonder if your line of reasoning has more to do with ideology and your view of (proposed) policy, than a considered look at the science at work. The mechanism of global warming is well-established. ...LiNeBrEaK"You write: 'It's getting colder. 2008 was the coolest year in a decade.' That leaves the other nine years to account for. If the last nine years were consecutively cooler, you would have a cooling trend. The trend is in the other direction.LiNeBrEaK"The glaciers, Greenland and the polar ice cap are melting. Plants and species are migrating northward to areas where they have not been seen in recorded history. LiNeBrEaK"And, according to The Washington Post (Jan. 12, 2008): 'Data collected from around the globe indicate that 2007 ranks as the second-warmest year on record, according to a new analysis from climatologists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. ... Seven of the eight warmest years on record have occurred since 2001.' LiNeBrEaK"There are a number of good books on this topic. The one that convinced me was 'Field Notes from a Catastrophe: A Frontline Report on Climate Change,' by Elizabeth Kolbert, Bloomsbury, 2007. LiNeBrEaK"I admire your courage in often taking the unpopular view. But a view may be popular because it is accurate, not because people are being deluded or misled, and that is the case here. ...LiNeBrEaK"I wonder if your time might be better spent - and the public better served - if you were to critique policy as regards energy and conservation rather than the problems (and global warming is only the most worrisome) that stem from long-term profligate and inefficient energy use."LiNeBrEaKI replied:LiNeBrEaKOf course it would be more convenient for the Luddites if I were to accept their underlying assumptions and limit myself to "critiquing policy as regards energy and conservation." Just as, in 1500, it would have been judged much safer to study how best to discover and destroy witches rather than to challenge whether the old crones had any demonic powers in the first place.LiNeBrEaKAs a matter of fact, challenging the existence of the supernatural powers of witches was prima facie proof that the challenger was himself a witch ("warlock," whatever), which was likely to get you burned.LiNeBrEaKAmazingly, under those circumstances, publicly expressed opinion - holding that the demonic powers of witches was real - was nearly unanimous! Ain't sealed systems grand?LiNeBrEaKYes, the mechanism of global warming is well-established. It's primarily solar, and has nothing to do with the tiny amount of "greenhouse gas" mankind produces. Or were there too many cars and coal-fired generating plants 10,000 years ago, when the last Ice Age spontaneously melted away? (See the nice charts at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation.)LiNeBrEaKWhat's not well-established is any ability to predict whether the globe will be warmer or cooler in three years, let alone 30 or 300.LiNeBrEaKWhen major green groups charted "greenhouse gas" emissions for 1991 (they sent me a lovely colorful graph, showing America as the "worst offender," of course) they listed the Philippines as a quite small producer, way "down the curve." This is because the Philippines are a "good" country, you understand, where people "know their place" and have properly resigned themselves to living in poverty, mostly doing without private motorcars or air conditioners, fertilizing their rice fields with human feces, etc.LiNeBrEaKI called the authors of the chart to ask how the Philippines could possibly have produced a tiny mount of greenhouse gases that year, since that's the year Mount Pinatubo erupted. They pointed me to a footnote that said "from man-made sources."LiNeBrEaKIf you're only going to measure greenhouses gases from man-made sources, you're only going to show greenhouse gases from man-made sources, making America's 1991 atmospheric contribution appear larger that the Philippines', which is absurd.LiNeBrEaKShouldn't we be asking how much is actually up there, and where it actually came from?LiNeBrEaKIf water vapor and CO2 are both greenhouse gases, and there's 100 times more water vapor than CO2 in the atmosphere, what effect would it have on the level of total greenhouse gases to double the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere?LiNeBrEaKLook up the Newsweek cover of April 28, 1975, on "The Cooling World." You'll find many of this same gang urging the same brand of government "energy policy" takeovers to halt the dangerous trend of "global cooling." As well they might, since the next Ice Age will be a real problem.LiNeBrEaKIt's all about seizing control of (and eviscerating) the economic advantages of the Western nations, which is why the greens show no interest in merely launching some reflective gravel into orbit, which would probably lower global temperature by a couple of degrees. (Look up 1816, the "Year Without Summer.") After all, if the alleged problem were simply and cheaply solved, how could they get any traction for their real Luddite agenda?LiNeBrEaKWhy do you suppose they sue to block virtually any project that might advance human welfare, citing the safety of weeds and bugs so obscure the litigants probably wouldn't recognize one if you plopped it on their dinner plate?LiNeBrEaKChina and India aren't about to stop churning out all the carbon smoke they deem necessary to catch and overtake any Western nations moronic enough to cripple their own economies out of some bizarre feeling of guilt that they "use too much energy."LiNeBrEaKEnergy use per capita is a pretty good measure of how far you're advancing from the Stone Age, when life expectancy was under 40. There is no energy shortage. We use less than 1 percent of the solar energy that streams past us. We need to start using a lot more of it. If some of us get rich in the process (without "taxpayer subsidies,") so much the better. That's what humankind is good at.LiNeBrEaKSolar, windmills and geothermal are vastly more expensive (poverty-inducing) and environmentally hazardous (when you consider the backup battery farms and transmission lines they'll require) than anything we've got now. They're tax-devouring make-work scams.LiNeBrEaKJulian Simon proved Paul Ehrlich and the "Population Bomb" folks wrong about their predictions re "running out of" whatever you care to name so many times they stopped accepting Mr. Simon's wagers.LiNeBrEaKOnly collectivists consider they have any moral right to criticize the "profligacy" of those who create enough wealth to use whatever they can buy on the free market, in any way they choose, whether it be "energy," land or long underwear. Collectivists are would-be thieves. They simply lack the courage to pull out a gun and deprive the "profligate fat cats" of their wealth directly - they prefer to hire bully-boys in government uniforms to do the job for them, under the sanctified cloak of "shared sacrifice."LiNeBrEaKThe Greens don't want to see "energy efficiency." They want to artificially make energy so expensive that we're forced to accept "reduced expectations" for our lifestyles and life expectancies.LiNeBrEaKIf the greens choose to use less energy, God bless them. Let them go squat around some jungle fire in loincloths, eating half-cooked monkey meat. But somehow, this prospect does not appear to please them. Somehow, they will be happy only if they can impose energy-deficient poverty on me.LiNeBrEaKAre the glaciers melting? Is that a good measure of climate change?

Lockport Union-Sun and Journal (New York)  	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	LOCKPORT: Production continues  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	734 words  	Jan. 4--LOCKPORT -- BY TARA G. MATHEWSONLiNeBrEaKeditor@journal-register.comLiNeBrEaKThere are 120,000 acres of Orleans County dedicated to farmland.LiNeBrEaKThat's an entire half of the county's total acreage, according to the USDA Farm Service Agency. With Western New York Energy LLC in the market for millions of bushels of corn for ethanol, farmers in the area have done their best to supply.LiNeBrEaKCY Farms of Elba sold 100,000 bushels to the new ethanol plant in Shelby and added their corn to the 19 million bushels WNY Energy LLC consumed in its first year of production. Farmers say this year's growing season for corn was one of the best in memory. Mike Riner, a farm manager at CY Farms, said yields were probably 30 bushels per acre better than the averages of recent years. LiNeBrEaK"It's rare we have a season that was this consistent with rainfall and sunshine," Riner said.LiNeBrEaKNormally, with yields so much higher than average, farmers would have to set up new storage bins to keep the corn, but the ethanol plant is a ready and willing buyer.LiNeBrEaK"This plant has been a tremendous asset as far as a place to put the corn," said Bill Eick, president of the Orleans County Farm Bureau, who estimated this year's yields even higher than Riner.LiNeBrEaKWNY Energy LLC, went online Nov. 29, 2007. After one year of production, Michael Sawyer, chief financial officer of the plant, put ethanol output at almost 55 million gallons, more than officials originally projected. They've also produced three byproducts: About 160,000 tons of distiller's grain that can be sold as livestock feed, 1. 2 million gallons of corn oil and about 10,000 tons of carbon dioxide since the CO2 plant started up Aug. 5.LiNeBrEaKTom Snyder, a Village of Medina trustee, sees the marketing of these byproducts as one of the best parts of the ethanol plant.LiNeBrEaK"It's waste-free," Snyder said. "All of it gets reutilized."LiNeBrEaKEPCO Carbon Dioxide Products Inc. was built next to WNY Energy's existing structure to capture the carbon dioxide released from the ethanol-making process. The CO2 plant traps the gas being produced and sends it through a system to get rid of impurities and turn it into 99. 99 percent pure carbon dioxide gas. From there, EPCO sells the gas to greenhouses, water treatment plants and beverageLiNeBrEaKmanufacturers.LiNeBrEaK"We're helping to reduce greenhouse gases and we're taking a natural byproduct of an existing company and we're turning around and making a product out of it," said Tom Schultz, EPCO plant manager.LiNeBrEaKThe CO2 plant currently is only running a few days per week because it can't sell as much carbon dioxide as it can capture from the ethanol plant. But by spring, Schultz hopes to run more steadily with greenhouses and water treatment plants more active and beverage plants gearing up for a busier summer season. When the plant is operating, it produces 350 tons of carbon dioxide per day.LiNeBrEaKProduction processLiNeBrEaKLooking into the community, there have been very few vocal opponents, especially since the ethanol plant began producing. In the planning stages, both Village of Medina and Town of Shelby officials heard complaints about possible smell and noise issues, but objections have died down.LiNeBrEaK"We're committed to being good neighbors and we do everything we can do here at the plant to minimize any impact we can have on the community," Sawyer said. "Overwhelmingly, the community has been very supportive."LiNeBrEaKBesides an early morning whistle from the "corn train," and a new smell to get used to, Shelby residents say they have little to complain about. Many point to benefits from the local plant. James Marciszewski, a truck driver for the CO2 plant, appreciates the boost to the local economy: the truckers for the plant who stop for breakfast before leaving town, the farmers that have an extra market for their corn and -- of course -- the new employees that enjoy competitive salaries compared to other local options.LiNeBrEaK"Any time you get anyone employed, it helps," Marciszewski said.

The Meadville Tribune (Pennsylvania)  	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	Record-setting winter tough to predict  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	641 words  	Jan. 4--IT'S COLD OUTSIDE -- at least for the moment. Last week, however, not so much. Next week? Who knows?LiNeBrEaKThe winter of 2008-09 is off to a bumpy start, interspersing periods of bone-chilling cold with record-setting highs.LiNeBrEaKTwo days before Christmas, for example, letter carrier Don Boyd was making his rounds in Cambridge Springs -- gingerly making his way along snow-covered walkways onto equally snow-covered porches. "It's a little adventure," he said a the time, flashing a game smile over his scarf. "I don't know what the rest of the winter will bring," he continued. "I hope we don't get this much snow -- but who knows?" LiNeBrEaKHe got that right.LiNeBrEaKFour days later, a record high of 68 degrees was reported at Erie International Airport, shattering a 62-degree record set in 1936 and setting a new high for the day for the entire region served by the National Weather Service office in Cleveland.LiNeBrEaKMeadville resident Tom Arno, an amateur meteorologist and The Meadville Tribune's weather consultant, has been predicting a colder, snowier winter than usual since September.LiNeBrEaK"When there's a really cold November and December, there's usually a reversal in January and February," Arno said during a recent interview. "This year, it looks like they're going to stay cold."LiNeBrEaKAs for the fluffy stuff, Meadville has an average snowfall of 70 inches, according to Arno, who keeps track of such things. Considering that the count is already over 50 inches, he predicts that this year's snowfall will easily exceed the average.LiNeBrEaKThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, however, isn't nearly as confident when it comes to predicting what tomorrow may bring.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, the 2008-09 U.S. Winter Outlook for the current meteorological winter, a period starting in December and extending through February, calls for equal chances for above-, near- or below-normal temperatures and precipitation for the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states.LiNeBrEaKAs part of their official annual forecast, the national weather gurus noted that the absence of both La Nina and El Nino in the equatorial Pacific Ocean -- major climate patterns based on ocean water temperatures that give forecasters lots of hints about what may happen months in advance -- makes predicting this year's seasonal weather, as they put it, "increasingly challenging."LiNeBrEaKIn the absence of those predictable patterns, the announcement continues, "other climate patterns over the Arctic and North Atlantic regions may play a significant role in influencing U.S. winter weather."LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, according to Michael Halpert, deputy director of NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, there's a catch. "These patterns are only predictable a week or two in advance and could persist for weeks at a time. Therefore, we expect variability, or substantial changes in temperature and precipitation across much of the country."LiNeBrEaKIn other words, anything may go.LiNeBrEaKAccording to Rob Wilson of WICU-TV in Erie, who serves as the Tribune's consulting meteorologist, that's exactly why he doesn't even try to do long-range forecasting.LiNeBrEaKThe Old Farmer's Almanac, a publication priding itself in its ability to take a long-range look, gives thumbs up to the variability theory, predicting that "temperatures will seesaw from January through March" in the Lower Lakes region, which includes Meadville.LiNeBrEaKFor those seeking guidance on how to dress for the early months of the New Year, we have a single word of advice: Layer.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 	January 4, 2009 Sunday   01 EDITION	Congress faces ambitious agenda  	A; Pg. 06  	369 words  	Congress faces ambitious agendaLiNeBrEaKBy apLiNeBrEaKRepublicans holding just enough seats for filibusterWashington PostWASHINGTON - Rarely have lawmakers confronted an agenda as ambitious as the one Congress will face upon convening this week, with an incoming president pushing to stabilize an economy on the brink of long-term recession, to create universal health coverage and to overhaul federal energy policies. LiNeBrEaKThere are already signs that the usual divisions that send so many ambitious bills down to defeat will confront President-elect Barack Obama in his first weeks on the job. Some Republicans are spoiling for an early policy fight that will test Obama's mettle, while a number of Democrats are seeking gains in exchange for supporting his initiatives. Conservative House Democrats are demanding that statutory deficit-reduction language be included in a pendingLiNeBrEaKeconomic-stimulus package that could ultimately cost a trillion dollars. And Senate centrists have warned that the incoming administration's ambitious global warming legislation might be a non-starter.LiNeBrEaKOver the past 15 years, during which a large majority of current lawmakers were first elected to Congress, partisan feuding has reduced Congress's output to a bare minimum of must-pass measures. Party-line voting peaked during the Bush presidency, while productivity slumped. The Senate held the lowest number of votes in 2008 since any year going back to 1951, according to a recent Congressional Quarterly survey.LiNeBrEaKWith Republicans holding just enough seats to put the brakes on sweeping initiatives in the Senate, the new president's agenda may rest on his ability to deliver on another campaign pledge, to change the way Washington does business by adopting a more pragmatic and inclusive governing style. And as the nation's economic woes deepen, there are early indications that lawmakers may be willing to put aside precedent, as the incoming Obama administration - at least so far - sends the welcome signals to key constituencies.LiNeBrEaKRepublicans will hold at least 41 Senate seats, enough to filibuster if they maintain discipline in their ranks. Soon after the election, Obama began to reach out to individual GOP members through phone calls and meetings.

Monterey County Herald (California)  	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	EDITORIAL: Editorial:  	COMMENTARY  	732 words  	Jan. 4--So far, 2009 feels a lot like 2008, except slightly warmer. This is not meant as evidence of global warming, so hold your letters. We have noticed that some who deny the existence of climate change do so with remarkable vigor, to the point of outright anger, for reasons that escape us. We have resolved to do our absolute best this year not to be a willing participant in anyone's anger exercises.LiNeBrEaKOur other resolutions for 2009 include avoidance of typographical errors, avoidance of David Broder and Cal Thomas columns unless they have something new to say, and avoidance of letters to the editor with more than four or five exclamation marks! LiNeBrEaKIn a more proactive vein, we resolve to work even harder to make sure a variety of opinions are reflected on this page and to not get worked up by the occasional correspondents, non-subscribers apparently, who accuse us of ignoring letters from Republicans. A regular feature of the letters column is, of course, letters from Republicans accusing us of not running letters from Republicans. We resolve to grin and bear it.LiNeBrEaKBut enough about us. As we are in the advice business, we do have some resolutions to propose for others, an annual offering that accomplishes less than Barack Obama's nicotine patches. Still, optimism bubbles up with the new year and we cannot stop ourselves.LiNeBrEaK-- Middle East antagonists: Resolve to recognize, finally, that none of those involved will ever admit to being wrong. They seem doomed to fight untilLiNeBrEaKthey stop trying to prove just how right they are.LiNeBrEaK-- Barack Obama: Resolve to remember how you got where you are. The need for dramatic change in Washington is beyond obvious, but it also is clear that we will be better off if the office does not dramatically change the seemingly unflappable new president.LiNeBrEaK-- Congress: Resolve to make the folks back home a priority. Somewhere near the top.LiNeBrEaK-- The pundits: Resolve to give it a rest. With all the blogs, the 24-hour news cycle and the proliferation of all the TV shows featuring speed-talking without speed-thinking, a politician's poor choice of words will be You Tubed around the planet faster than Caroline Kennedy can say "you know." Comment and criticize all you want, but not until you've thought about your subject for at least a few minutes.LiNeBrEaK-- The California Legislature: Resolve to recognize that it's your job to govern and lead, not to posture politically. California's budget troubles must be solved before the resulting debt crushes the taxpayer.LiNeBrEaK-- Gov. Schwarzenegger: Resolve to stop "demanding" anything from the Legislature. It isn't working.LiNeBrEaK-- Taxpayers: Resolve to think about the long-term implications when you fight against a tax increase. It's true that some of what government does isn't really worth a nickel, but a nickel saved now could cost you a dime later.LiNeBrEaK-- Retailers: Resolve to keep up the customer service. We remember when a shoplifter couldn't get any attention in most stores. Now a browser gets the "May I help you?" treatment repeatedly. It can be annoying but it sure beats the old way.LiNeBrEaK-- Business: Resolve to find a system that allows for earnings during good times to help cover expenses during bad times. The Wall Street way, requiring profits to climb every quarter, scuttles creativity, quashes reinvestment and rewards short-sightedness. It has a lot to do with how we got here.LiNeBrEaK-- American automakers: Resolve to forget the past. You can offer every pickup in 20 variations each year but it takes decades to mimic the Japanese?LiNeBrEaK-- Pacific Grove ice cream eaters: Resolve to relax. The owner of the Ice Cream Shoppe in P.G. got carried away while debating the war with a soldier. He apologized, received his comeuppance and apologized some more, yet there is still talk of boycott. Let's move along. Sugar cone or regular?LiNeBrEaK-- All of us: Resolve to try to pay attention to each other and to try not to be so darned certain of our own correctness.

The New York Times 	January 4, 2009 Sunday   Late Edition - Final	Planning the Fate of a Nuclear Plant's Land  	Section LI; Column 0; Long Island Weekly Desk; LAND USE; Pg. 1  	1248 words  	TWO decades after the $6 billion Shoreham nuclear power plant was closed, the Long Island Power Authority has announced plans to hire a consultant to advise it on what to do with a 58-acre waterfront property where the plant's decommissioned remains are located.LiNeBrEaK  The authority's 1. 1 million customers have never received energy from the Shoreham plant, the only fully licensed nuclear power reactor never to go into commercial operation, and are still paying off its remaining debt -- now $3. 3 billion -- in their electric bills. LiNeBrEaK  Kevin S. Law, the authority's president and chief executive, said that selling the property would be considered and could help retire some of the Shoreham debt. LIPA or a buyer could make use of the plant for a new purpose or simply work around it. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Law and members of a Shoreham advisory committee he created in April said other possibilities for the site included an alternative energy park or research center; conversion of the nuclear plant into a natural gas-powered generator or construction of a new gas plant; a manufacturing or industrial operation not related to energy production; some combination of these uses; and even a tourist attraction.  LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Law said all options would be on the table except one: The state law that created the authority prohibits a nuclear plant, he said, and therefore none will be considered.LiNeBrEaK  ''There is a movement within the environmental community internationally to support nuclear power because it doesn't have emissions and because of climate change issues,'' he said. ''But the fact of the matter is,  Long Island still cannot be evacuated,'' a key factor in the plant's closing.LiNeBrEaK  The Shoreham plant, announced by the Long Island Lighting Company in 1965 and tested at low power in 1985, was shuttered in 1989 in a deal between the company and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. Lilco later merged with Brooklyn Union Gas to form the KeySpan Corporation, which in turn was acquired by British-owned National Grid two years ago.LiNeBrEaK  The closing of the Shoreham plant followed years of protests that evacuation would be impossible in the event of an accident at the 800-megawatt plant. Lilco sold the plant to LIPA for a ceremonial $1 in 1992. The authority assumed the $6 billion plant debt. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Law said that no matter what decision was  made about the property, the authority had an obligation to do something with it. He said he expected a decision sometime in 2010. LiNeBrEaK  Of the ratepayers, he said, ''We owe it to them to figure out the best reuse of the property so they at least derive some benefit from it.'' LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Law said LIPA had no plans to tear the plant down, a project he said would cost tens of millions of dollars. LiNeBrEaK  The committee members said the land-use study should also take into account 800 acres of mostly wooded land surrounding the Shoreham site that is owned by National Grid and zoned by the Town of Brookhaven to allow one house on every 10 acres. The LIPA property is zoned for heavy industry. LiNeBrEaK  ''There was a consensus that you can't plan for the 58 acres without looking at the 800 acres to see the entire potential,'' said Matthew C. Cordaro, a professor at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University and a committee member. He  said a multiple-use plan involving both properties should be examined.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Law said that while joint planning with National Grid would be desirable, LIPA needed to move ahead. ''I can't wait for them,'' he said. LiNeBrEaK  The 15-member advisory committee, which requested that the authority hire the land-use consultant, also includes elected federal, state and local officials, officials from the Shoreham Wading River Central School District, civic leaders and others.LiNeBrEaK  The school district, which the Shoreham plant once  largely supported, is now in need of cash and struggling to hold down its tax rate. ''The closing of the plant has certainly presented the district with financial challenges,'' Superintendent Harriet Copel said.LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Copel and Kevin B. Ward, president of the Shoreham Civic Association, said a new source of taxes was desperately needed. Both are advisory committee members. LiNeBrEaK  ''A ratable would be a big help,'' Mr. Ward said. But, he added, residents were worried about any commercial development that would increase local traffic.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Ward said National Grid needed to be a part of any planning because of the overriding importance of what it eventually proposes for its 800 acres. ''We would like them to be as involved as possible,'' he said.LiNeBrEaK  National Grid does not have a member on the committee but is monitoring its sessions. LiNeBrEaK  On Dec. 1, a decision by the United States Supreme Court set back prospects for a new natural gas supply at Shoreham, a supply Mr. Law and others said was a prerequisite for a gas-powered generating station there.  The court refused to hear an appeal by Islander East, a natural gas pipeline company half-owned by National Grid, of a lower court ruling upholding the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection's denial of a clean water permit needed for the project to proceed. LiNeBrEaK  The gas line would have run under Long Island Sound from Branford, Conn., to near the Shoreham site.LiNeBrEaK  Edward P. Romaine, a Suffolk County legislator from Center Moriches who is on the advisory committee, said the property should become a solar energy park or what he called a green research facility. LiNeBrEaK  But existing solar technology works best when it is near the user, experts say. An example would be solar panels on roofs of commercial buildings. LiNeBrEaK  The Shoreham property's location on Long Island Sound between Shoreham and Wading River is not considered favorable for wind turbines. Experts say that for Long Island, only offshore areas in the Atlantic Ocean have enough wind to make commercial turbines feasible. LiNeBrEaK  Two small wind turbines LIPA installed on the Shoreham property have had mixed records and were not turning on a recent morning in light winds. LiNeBrEaK  As LIPA plans for its 58 acres, National Grid is considering what to do with its 800-acre property and ''how best to dispose of it down the road,'' said Steven L. Zelkowitz, its executive vice president for business development and energy. LiNeBrEaK  ''We think this is a large enough piece of property that we could accommodate development, recreational uses and some land preservation,'' he said. ''Just what that development might look like, I wouldn't even venture to guess. It's going to take awhile.''LiNeBrEaK  He said cooperation with LIPA on a joint plan was a possibility. He said he did not think National Grid would be interested in buying the LIPA parcel. LiNeBrEaK  While Mr. Law said all possibilities for the 58 acres short of a nuclear plant would be considered, opposition to some uses seems likely. LiNeBrEaK  In 2003, local residents objected to an $800 million proposal by American Ref-Fuel to incinerate New York City garbage at the site that was brought in by barges. The project did not advance. Area residents have also opposed a ferry terminal at Shoreham because of road traffic.LiNeBrEaK  Meantime, LIPA continues to rely on imported nuclear power to meet part of electricity demand. Its 2009 operating budget calls for importing 7. 7 percent of total energy requirements from the Nine Mile Point nuclear power station in Oswego, N.Y. LIPA owns 18 percent of its Unit 2. LiNeBrEaK  Nuclear imports would increase substantially if LIPA renews a power contract from the James A. FitzPatrick nuclear plant near Oswego. The contract expires at the end of this year, the authority said.

News and Observer (Raleigh, North Carolina)  	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	The News and Observer, Raleigh, N.C., J. Peder Zane column: Science visions, dark and bright  	LIFESTYLE  	1000 words  	Jan. 4--Talk about change was more plentiful in 2008 than loose coins in an old couch.LiNeBrEaKDespite all the lip-flapping, that place where gods and devils dwell -- the details -- was largely unexplored.LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration will soon offer its ideas for reviving the economy and reshaping America's foreign policy. But politicians aren't the only ones who can remake the world. LiNeBrEaKScientists have at least as much power to transform our lives and history. What "game-changing scientific ideas and developments" do they expect to occur during the next few decades?LiNeBrEaKThat's the question John Brockman, editor of the Web site edge.org, posed to about 160 cutting-edge minds in his 11th annual Edge Question. As in years past, they responded with bold, often thrilling, sometimes chilling, answers.LiNeBrEaKSome see the dawning of a new era in which machines replace most human labor and we kick our addiction to oil with the help of the mighty sun and hungry microorganisms. Others envision us colonizing distant galaxies, developing immensely powerful quantum computers and redefining the notion of empathy as being able to know how birds feel when they are soaring across the sky.LiNeBrEaKA few offer darker forecasts, of a world crippled by nuclear weapons and our unwillingness to act forcefully on global climate change.LiNeBrEaKEchoing the 2008 political campaign, hope was far more prevalent than gloom among Brockman's respondents. While detailing an array of ideas, the greatest number of responses focused on medical breakthroughs that may allow us to live 150 years or more, replace broken body parts like flat tires and tap the full potential of our minds.LiNeBrEaKThose prospects seem probable because they are based on two current lines of research: those involving stem cells and the human genome.LiNeBrEaKA key to longevity could be found in the first days after conception, when we were all cute little fertilized eggs whose few cells (aka stem cells) had limitless possibilities -- they might become any part of our bodies. That's exactly what they do as cell division continues and some form lungs, others hearts, arms or legs.LiNeBrEaKBy working with these undifferentiated stem cells, researchers have grown mouse hearts and pig bladders, reports Juan Enriquez, founding director of the Harvard Business School's Life Science Project. Other scientists have transformed adult skin cells into stem cells, providing, perhaps, a limitless supply of them while avoiding the politics that surround abortion.LiNeBrEaKWhile discussion of stem cells centers on their use in combating disease, Enriquez said healthy people may turn to them for enhancement. Just as some lizards and crabs can regrow limbs, humans may be able to regenerate entire arms, legs and organs that are better than those provided us at birth.LiNeBrEaK"Many of our grandchildren," Enriquez writes, "will likely engineer themselves into what we would consider a new species, one with extraordinary capabilities."LiNeBrEaKThe unlocking of the human genome will make medicine radically more effective. Today it costs about $350,000 to sequence an individual's genome; a few years ago, it cost $1 billion. Further price drops will spark an era of "personalized medicine in which drugs are prescribed according to the patient's molecular background rather than by trial and error," writes Steven Pinker, a psychology professor at Harvard University.LiNeBrEaKIt will also eliminate many genetic diseases.LiNeBrEaK"Just as Tay-Sachs has almost been wiped out in the decade since Ashkenazi Jews have tested themselves for the gene," he writes, "a universal carrier screen ... [may] eliminate hundreds of other" disorders."LiNeBrEaKMinds will followLiNeBrEaKAs we improve our bodies, we will transform our minds. Our growing understanding of the brain should produce not only effective treatments for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, schizophrenia and autism but also ways to combat the biological forces that make some people more susceptible to addiction or criminality.LiNeBrEaKBrian Knutson, who teaches psychology and neuroscience at Stanford University, believes we will be able to insert implants into the brain that control the firing of neurons that "modulate mood, alertness, memory, control, willpower and more."LiNeBrEaKFreeman Dyson, a physicist at the Institute for Advanced Studies, writes that we will be able to convert "neural signals into radio signals." This would let us place "tiny transmitters" inside our heads, enabling "the direct communication of feelings and thoughts from brain to brain."LiNeBrEaKTo which I can only say: After you, Mr. Dyson.LiNeBrEaKScience writer Kenneth W. Ford raises a concern about this breakthrough: The tools that allow us to read someone's else mind will also enable us to write thoughts upon their minds. Advances that provide a better life can also harm us.LiNeBrEaKThe change envisioned by Brockman's respondents may be possible, but is it desirable? Will we truly be better off if, as writer Gregory Paul suggests, science allows us to "upgrade" ourselves so much that we are no longer human beings but "ultra-sophisticated ... robot systems"?LiNeBrEaKThis prospect is frightening and thrilling. More important, it's probably inevitable.LiNeBrEaKUnlike politics, science is not directly democratic. Brockman notes: "Nobody ever voted for radio, the telephone, the automobile, the airplane, television. Nobody ever voted for penicillin [or] ... the Pill."LiNeBrEaKThose breakthroughs, however, did not thrive through force but because people concluded they were beneficial. For all it costs, science has made today better than yesterday and promises an even better tomorrow.LiNeBrEaKHere's hoping that doesn't change.LiNeBrEaKpeder.zane@newsobserver.com or 919-829-4773	SCIENCE NEWS (89%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (89%); BIOTECHNOLOGY and GENETIC SCIENCE (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); MEDICAL RESEARCH (77%); DISEASES and DISORDERS (76%); POLITICS (76%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (72%); LIFE EXPECTANCY (72%); STEM CELL RESEARCH (67%); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (67%); CAMPAIGNS and ELECTIONS (65%); CHILDREN (64%); ABORTION (62%); MILITARY WEAPONS (51%)  	BARACK OBAMA (58%)  	NORTH CAROLINA, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 4, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 News and Observer   	J.

Palo Alto Daily News (California)  	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	Local activist ready to be mayor  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	914 words  	Jan. 4--Peter Drekmeier, a lifelong environmentalist, says his decision to run for Palo Alto City Council in 2005 grew out of his frustration with the previous year's U.S. presidential election.LiNeBrEaKHe had worked on the unsuccessful campaign of Democrat John Kerry.LiNeBrEaK"I realized the change we so desperately needed was not going to come from the federal government," Drekmeier said in an interview Friday. LiNeBrEaKTo tackle problems such as climate change, "We were going to have to work at the local and grassroots level to get elected."LiNeBrEaKAfter four years on the council, Drekmeier, 45, is poised to become the city's mayor -- ironically, just as another green-minded Democrat, Barack Obama, prepares to enter the White House.LiNeBrEaKLike Obama, however, he will have to temper his big-picture environmental agenda with the pressing demands of an economic recession.LiNeBrEaKAs vice mayor, Drekmeier is the likely choice to succeed Larry Klein as mayor in a vote of the Palo Alto City Council on Monday. If chosen, he'll serve for one year, presiding over council meetings and representing the city to the public.LiNeBrEaKThe son of two anti-war Stanford professors, Drekmeier grew up on intimate terms with both political activism and nature. When his parents held seminars on social thought at their Sutter Avenue home, Drekmeier said he and his sister stay up late listening at the door. When the family took day trips to the Palo Alto Baylands, he would play in the tidepools and catch lizards and snakes.LiNeBrEaKThose interests intersected soon after he graduated from UC-Berkeley with a political science degree. Looking for inspiration at Stanford's 1989 "You Can Make a Difference" conference, the 24-year-old Drekmeier got excited about a local campaign to publicize the 20th anniversary of Earth Day.LiNeBrEaKHe soon joined the effort fulltime, working out of an Emerson Street office that local developer Jim Baer offered to the cause rent-free. As issues coordinator, Drekmeier was tasked with writing fact sheets on little-known phenomena such as global warming.LiNeBrEaKAfter Earth Day 1990, Drekmeier and several of his colleagues continued their advocacy by forming a group called Bay Area Action, a forerunner of the Palo Alto-based environmental nonprofit Acterra.LiNeBrEaKHighlights of his activist career included helping to block a proposed Devil's Slide highway bypass in the 1990s, and spearheading the Stanford Open Space Alliance to pressure Stanford into protecting its foothills through the 2000 general use permit. In 2007, he took a post as program manager for the San Francisco based Tuolumne River Trust. Drekmeier's environmental work hasn't slowed in his time on the council. At his first priority-setting session, he called for the city to cut back its greenhouse gas emissions, a goal that was codified in the city's Climate Protection Plan in 2007. He also helped drive the city's green building ordinance and zero-waste plan, and lately he's been pushing a plastic bag ban.LiNeBrEaKAt its last meeting in December, the council split over whether to set aside a slice of dedicated parkland in the Baylands for greenwaste composting. Drekmeier favored keeping the compost local, arguing that to ship it out of town would counteract the city's climate goals.LiNeBrEaKThe debate ended in a stalemate, with parks backers determined not to blemish the Byxbee Park Hills with an industrial waste operation. But Drekmeier said Friday he's optimistic he can sell his colleagues on a new, cleaner and more compact composting technology. In the future, he said, in-vessel composting could allow the city to recycle not only yard waste but food waste and sludge, perhaps even converting it to usable energy.LiNeBrEaKIt's typical of Drekmeier to be looking further into the future than most on an environmental issue. But this year, he'll have to make his case against the very immediate backdrop of a grim economy. He admits it will be a challenge.LiNeBrEaK"Obviously the economy is going to be the primary issue," he said. "But there are a lot of ways we can do what's best for the environment and save money in the long run."LiNeBrEaKFor example, Drekmeier hopes to shave consultant fees, instead tapping into the knowledge of residents through citizen groups such as the Community Environmental Action Partnership. Such programs, he says, have the secondary benefit of developing future city leaders.LiNeBrEaKStill, costly plans that save money in the long run could be a tough sell as the city grapples with an immediate budget problem. A December financial update projected a deficit of $2. 6 million in the current fiscal year and $5. 3 million in 2010. Drekmeier said he believes that Palo Alto, and the nation as a whole under Obama, can use the recession as "a real wakeup call" to convert to more sustainable consumption and transportation habits.LiNeBrEaK"I think it's really in our own interest to support more local farmers, produce more energy locally -- to be more locally self-reliant," he said. As the government prepares to stimulate the economy by funneling billions into infrastructure projects, "We need to see the environment as our ultimate infrastructure."

In addition, recent ... studies have shown that subsidizing corn ethanol causes more land to be plowed up which actually boosts greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK"Mr. Obama has declared that 'my administration will value science.'

Reading Eagle (Pennsylvania)  	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	EDITORIAL: Securing the future in Northumberland  	COMMENTARY  	633 words  	Jan. 4--When it comes to preparing wisely for the future, a good start is an absolute necessity.LiNeBrEaK"The beginning is the most important part of the work," Plato noted.LiNeBrEaKAnd the beginning really starts with a well-thought-out plan; otherwise, as Benjamin Franklin noted, "By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail."LiNeBrEaKWith the economy in turmoil, one might be tempted to apply this wisdom in hindsight, but while we all can benefi t from learning the lessons of recent history, it's time to deal with the present and not just plan for a return to prosperity, but take steps to make this happen. LiNeBrEaKThat's why it's heartening to see leaders in the coal region, which decades ago saw its fortunes fall with the dethroning of King Coal, concentrate on starting anew to rebuild prosperity.LiNeBrEaKAttuned to the world's growing appetite for energy, Northumberland County has devised a plan to position itself as an energy epicenter.LiNeBrEaKThe county's ample coal reserves are being marketed to energy-hungry nations such as Brazil, China and India, with proceeds earmarked for a renewable energy fund that private entrepreneurs can tap to bring renewable-energy jobs to the county.LiNeBrEaKEven old waste coal piles are seen as a resource, with new technologies producing usable fuel that can be sold to those countries.LiNeBrEaKAlso in the works is a plan to work with coal mines and cogeneration plants to develop clean-burning technologies, an important selling point in an environmentally-conscious world.LiNeBrEaKAlthough the county seems to have a narrow focus in that it revolves around energy, it is not putting all of its eggs in one basket.LiNeBrEaKAmong other strategies is growing plants such as switchgrass on reclaimed mine lands to provide biomass that will fi re turbines and generate electricity.LiNeBrEaKDeveloping renewable energy resources such as biomass is not just the next big thing, it's happening now, as industrialized nations try to reduce their consumption of fossil fuels, which are nonrenewable and high in environmental costs because of their byproducts and the damage done to the land.LiNeBrEaKOther renewable energy projects go even farther on the green scale: leasing county lands for wind turbines, working with private investors to use mine water for geothermal heat and developing a hydrogenpowered private bus fl eet.LiNeBrEaKThese projects have the added advantage of not releasing carbon dioxide -- the major culprit in global warming -- into the atmosphere as a consequence of energy production.LiNeBrEaKThe plan includes developing infrastructure and processes vital to realizing the vision: establishing an energy incubator building to provide offi ce space for energy companies, organizing an energy council to provide advice on development and policy, and aggressively marketing the area to renewable-energy companies through tax incentives and a streamlined regulatory process.LiNeBrEaKOf course, we recognize that even the best-laid plans can go astray. Unforeseen problems will crop up. Plans will have to be tweaked, and approaches will have to be adjusted.LiNeBrEaKBut the future cannot be left to chance. Northumberland County certainly is taking steps in the best possible direction. The people of Northumberland will be served best by putting into action a working plan for success, one that takes into account the world's needs along with the area's strengths and what it needs to become stronger.LiNeBrEaKAs Miguel de Cervantes observed, "To be prepared is half the victory."

Reading Eagle (Pennsylvania)  	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	For students, times have changed  	LIFESTYLE  	602 words  	Jan. 4--Five years older than they were in 2003, seven students came to the 12th and Marion Elementary School feeling s m a r t e r a n d d e f i n i t e l y changed.LiNeBrEaKTwo didn't remember being questioned as a part of "A Kids Say the Darndest Things" panel when they were in early elementary school. The rest had only a vague recall of the event, but didn't remember specific queries. LiNeBrEaK"How am I different?" repeated Chistina Vicioso, 13, an eighth-grader at St. Margaret's Catholic School. "Well, I was shorter then ... and I am a lot smarter now."LiNeBrEaK"I have longer hair, and I'm a lot better at tennis" said Angel Moyer, 11, a sixth-grader at Reading's Gateway School of Science, Agriculture and Ecology.LiNeBrEaK"I wanted to be a veterinarian back then, but that doesn't interest me anymore," said Tiffany Youse, 13, an eighth-grader at Hamburg Middle School. "I'm more interested in psychology ... because I like helping people."LiNeBrEaKThree of the students, Tylynn Simms, 13, eighth-grader in Northeast Junior High School; Matthew Huey, 13, seventh-grader at Southern Middle School; and Justice Mengel, 12, a sixth-grader at Muhlenberg Intermediate School, all felt they were smarter than years ago.LiNeBrEaKIndeed, the trio either get straight As, make honor rolls or are enrolled in advanced courses.LiNeBrEaK"I think I'm more mature," said Tiana Evans, 11, a sixthgrader at the Gateway School for Performing Arts. "I used to play the flute, but it was so boring. I'm interested in plays and performing ... and maybe teaching."LiNeBrEaKBrought together again to answer some old questions and some new ones, the children are at different developmental stage from when they were fi rst questioned.LiNeBrEaKIn general, they appear achievement oriented, outgoing, a bit more serious ... and sometimes worried.LiNeBrEaKWhen asked what they thought were the biggest issues facing Reading or the world today, some mentioned global warming, pollution, the economy, but nearly all were concerned about "crime," "violence" and "gangs."LiNeBrEaK"Violence ... I don't like to see people die or get hurt for dumb reasons," Angel said.LiNeBrEaK"Gangs have become a big problem," Tylynn said. "Kids are in them (gangs) to be cool, have friends and to pick on others who aren't (in them)."LiNeBrEaK"There's a need to stop violence ... and if you see it you should stop to report it," Tiana said.LiNeBrEaK"Years ago, little kids would tell you they're concerned about littering," said Carol Butler, a Berks County Intermediate Unit teacher, a 21-year education veteran, who served as questioner.LiNeBrEaK"You will get many more diverse and different answers today," she said. "Kids are much more aware of what goes on in the world and in their neighborhoods."LiNeBrEaKTwo years ago, Butler said a mother of one of her students was shot and killed not too far from the school. Every child under her direction knew about it, she said.LiNeBrEaK"On Thursday of that same week, we had another mother die of an overdose," Butler said.LiNeBrEaKThe children wanted to talk that week in their day-care setting, but it wasn't about homework or games or social chitchat. It was about death.LiNeBrEaK"Children have to express themselves, so we regularly reassure them that our school is a safe haven, a secure place for them ... that we are a family and are here to protect them," Butler said.

Buyers of these seats will try to regain their spent money by lobbying for rich businesses and by kickbacks from all possible sources, including terrorists. We need to stop this ideology. -- Jay Mittal, Glen AllenLiNeBrEaKIllinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich is just one person who can be voted out of office, but what about the residents of Illinois whose majority voted him into office? How perceptive are they? How could they have voted him in? The scariest question is, do they care? -- Bea Merkle, HenricoLiNeBrEaKGlobal warming is going to freeze me to death. -- Howard Lindsey, Highland SpringsLiNeBrEaKAfter a thorough investigation of itself, team Obama completely cleared itself of any wrongdoing in the scandal involving Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Get ready, ladies and gentlemen: For at least the next four years, we will be treated to a level of unprecedented condescension by the incoming president as well as a bouillabaisse of nonfeasance, malfeasance, and a lack of intellectual curiosity from the media. I do hope the adoring eyes of his followers sufficiently unglaze, allowing them to apply a fraction of the critical-thinking skills to Barack Obama that they used to turn President George W. Bush into their Emmanuel Goldstein. -- Randy Lofland, MidlothianLiNeBrEaKRegarding the move of Armstrong students into Kennedy High School: I think that was the dumbest thing that ever happened in the history of the Richmond school system. To put all the projects in the same school was just dumb. I think the schools should be separated so that we can better manage the students as well as give them a better education. -- Earl Daniel, RichmondLiNeBrEaKSome historians believe it was World War II that ended the Great Depression. If we have to fight World War III in order to end this depression, at least it will all be over in 20 minutes. -- Jim Seay, HenricoLiNeBrEaKIt appears that the raw sewage of the Bush administration policy of lying to cover up bad news has polluted the EPA's Chesapeake Bay office, which may have to replace all those "Save the Bay" bumper stickers with "Save Our Necks." -- Ernest Irby, HenricoLiNeBrEaKRecently, while riding home, I happened to notice the greedy oil company terrorists were up to their usual tricks again. Several stations had raised their prices from $1. 44 per gallon to $1. 57 per gallon for apparently no reason but to cheat. Oil prices have been and still are dropping . . . . Shouldn't these greedy companies be prosecuted? Or let them go out of business. We will try our business with the oil cartel. It seems like they are more honorable. -- Irvin Maslow, ChesterfieldLiNeBrEaKWill all those politicians who endorsed the president's plan to put Social Security money into the stock market please stand up? -- Mike Giletto, HenricoLiNeBrEaKI hear that this time of year is a good time to have work done on one's house. It is reported that material prices are down and contractors work for less because they aren't as booked up as in the rest of the year. So couldn't the auto makers do the same? Cut prices so low that they, at the very minimum, get the money they need to survive for a while. It would help people to afford a new vehicle, removing clunkers from the roads, thus making it safer for us all. If the new owners are happy with the vehicle they bought, they in turn would speak highly of that make and model, so maybe their friends will also buy. Otherwise, there are many small-time contractors who year after year should have received "bailouts" during the winter months when work is hard to get. -- Jerry Woodard, Richmond	EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (91%); VOTERS and VOTING (87%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (76%); LOBBYING (74%); INVESTIGATIONS (73%); MISCONDUCT (72%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS and INSTITUTIONS (70%); US PRESIDENTS (86%); EDUCATION (65%); HUMANITIES and SOCIAL SCIENCE (65%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (65%); HISTORY (65%); GREAT DEPRESSION (63%); WORLD WAR II (60%); TERRORISM (53%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  	ROD BLAGOJEVICH (83%); BARACK OBAMA (82%); GEORGE W BUSH (52%); BEN NELSON (51%)  	RICHMOND, VA, USA (92%) ILLINOIS, USA (93%); VIRGINIA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 4, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Richmond Times - Dispatch   	Richmond Times-Dispatch, Va.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 	January 4, 2009 Sunday   New River Edition	FIELD GUIDE TO...A FEW PREDICTIONS FOR 2009  	CURRENT; Pg. NRV12  	313 words  	It is time for another round of predictions as I watch bird flocks and study pig innards to determine the events of 2009 in the New River Valley.LiNeBrEaKSome readers may recall that some of my finest and most sensible predictions -- such as moving Tech football games to Northern Virginia, which would single-handedly end global warming -- have yet to come true. LiNeBrEaKPatience, readers, patience. Some day they shall be, and so shall these:LiNeBrEaKTerry Caldwell, Lance Terpenny and the rest of Christiansburg's staff will do a fine job of managing the new aquatics center. What with Caldwell's great work at the Frog Pond and Christiansburg's track record with its rec center, I didn't even need to use my psychic powers for this one.LiNeBrEaKBlacksburg's downtown -- and I mean the real one, not the pretend one -- is going to be fine, too. Good things are already afoot. (The handsome new hotel and the used textbook store come to mind.) And I'm eagerly awaiting the opening of Beaux Arts Galleria. If we can get the sidewalks open again, the sky is the limit.LiNeBrEaKVirginia Tech will rethink the wisdom of building a new, even grander temple of football, if only for the symbolic example of refraining from wallowing in locker-room opulence during a recession.LiNeBrEaKThe money saved by not building the new locker room will be put to use fixing up the unfinished Smart Road ugliness as I suggested some time ago.LiNeBrEaKMountain Lake will start filling up again and be back at full pond in time for paddle boat season.LiNeBrEaKWhile patting itself on the back over the intermodal port, the commonwealth of Virginia will suddenly clap a hand to its head and say, "Oh, wait, maybe building a trucking center along I-81 will increase truck traffic on I-81 after all. My bad."LiNeBrEaKAnd back again this year, for a record 37th year on the countdown: Someone, somehow, will fix that car-destroying ditch in front of the Christiansburg post office.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	Advocacy groups greening Utah: Environmentalism ? Study shows groups are increasing at nearly double the rate of other nonprofits.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	770 words  	Jan. 4--The grass roots sprouting up around Utah are mostly green.LiNeBrEaKNew environmental groups are sprouting up all over -- contrary to a declaration five years ago that the green movement had grown monolithic, fossilized and died.LiNeBrEaKSome of Utah's new groups focus on neighborhoods, such as the San Juan County community concerned about uranium mining planned for their area. LiNeBrEaKOthers organize constituencies, like the Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment and the Utah Moms for Clean Air.LiNeBrEaKAnd still more focus on a particular environmental problem, like Uranium Watch, concentrating on pollution from nuclear energy, or Urgency Utah, campaigning to bring climate-change solutions to the forefront.LiNeBrEaKBrigham Young University political science professor Kelly Patterson says the sprouting of new green groups makes sense on an issue as diverse as the environment. While Utahns might snub a Washington-based organization focused broadly on national environmental policy, they readily welcome neighbors addressing a problem down the block.LiNeBrEaK"It's what you do about uranium tailings," said Patterson, who studies interest groups. "It's what you do about particulate matter [air pollution], it's what you do about preserving open spaces."LiNeBrEaKThe trend isn't unique to Utah. A new study by the Urban Institute shows that green groups are increasing at nearly double the rate of other kinds of nonprofits. Meanwhile, author Paul Hawken describes theLiNeBrEaKphenomenon as part of a global movement in his book Blessed Unrest .LiNeBrEaKFor Cherise Udell, president and founder of Utah Moms for Clean Air, none of this is surprising.LiNeBrEaKExasperated with the apparent apathy about high-pollution periods in the Salt Lake Valley, she recognized "a need and a niche to be filled" when she launched Moms nearly two years ago.LiNeBrEaK"Caring about the environment has become mainstream," says Udell. "It's no longer a fringe issue."LiNeBrEaKThe group now has an e-mail list of around 1,200 and a track record of accomplishments that include reducing motor vehicle idling at schools and a school-bus retrofitting program intended to lessen children's exposure to polluted exhaust. Members, many with a professional background, have been known to petition lawmakers with a baby balanced on their hips, a loaf of banana bread in one hand and legal documents in the other.LiNeBrEaK"We really brought the air issue to the kitchen table," says Udell.LiNeBrEaKAir-quality problems also prompted Salt Lake City anesthesiologist Brian Moench to create the doctors' group. With about 80 members now, the doctors emphasize health impacts of pollution to nearby communities.LiNeBrEaK"The public's knowledge of these issues is probably our biggest ally," he says. "The best progress that will be made is through public pressure."LiNeBrEaKJim Westwater, founder of the Utah Valley Sierra Forum, says he rallied inactive Sierra Club members and others interested in environmental issues after he relocated to Utah a couple of years ago. Now over 400 people are part of the network, participating in hikes, cleanups and the group's monthly discussion forums.LiNeBrEaKThe debate has included lively sessions on such issues as the benefits of nuclear power, consumerism and faith and the environment. It's a delicate balance to strike in a community where environmentalism is often shunned.LiNeBrEaKSays Westwater: "We're trying to appeal to people's higher nature."LiNeBrEaKSarah Fields, of Moab-based Uranium Watch, agrees that public education is key. For many years the go-to person for information on all things nuclear in southeastern Utah, Fields now shares the government documents she digs up on the group's Web page.LiNeBrEaKA better-informed community years ago might have gone a long way toward preventing the Atlas uranium-processing mill from becoming a $1 billion hazardous waste cleanup, she says.LiNeBrEaK"It's when you are in the local community -- that's when you know what's going on."LiNeBrEaKIn the end, the proliferation of environmental groups is a trend that's likely to continue, says University of Utah political science professor Dan McCool. It's also bound to be good for democracy, he says.LiNeBrEaK"Small, local groups, can target in a way that national groups cannot."LiNeBrEaKfahys@sltrib.comLiNeBrEaKRead moreLiNeBrEaKThe study shows environmental nonprofits are on the rise.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	For Utah agriculture, energy, paperwork efficiency is key to survival  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1292 words  	Jan. 4--When it comes to paperwork, Utah farmers and ranchers are failing, and it's costing them thousands of dollars in federal money that could help them be more energy efficient.LiNeBrEaKWhile their national counterparts are collecting millions from grants for renewable-energy projects, state farmers and ranchers are sending off incomplete applications. As many as 90 percent of the grants from Utah are rejected because technical details are faulty or the farmers simply don't understand the questions.LiNeBrEaK"Sometimes it seems like farmers and ranchers totally ignore what the application asks for," said Roger Koon, a specialist with the Rural Development Office in Salt Lake City. "It can be [daunting], but if they'll go step by step and take their time, they can do what's required."LiNeBrEaKBeyond being able (or willing) to follow directions, Utah farmers and ranchers also are behind the curve in their low number of applications, said Misty Conrad, technical assistance program manager for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo., which does grant technical reviews. LiNeBrEaK"These grants are for tried-and-true technology that cuts energy costs," she said. "Utah has a number of fantastic opportunities to get help. We'd love to see more applications coming out of the state."LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Department of Agriculture provides grants and loans to farmers who want to develop renewable-energy or energy-efficiency projects, covering up to 75 percent of the cost.LiNeBrEaKBut in Utah, only 10 percent to 20 percent of the applications submitted are accepted. Projects can include wind towers, refurbishing old hydroelectric equipment or installing solar panels to take advantage of Utah's most abundant energy source.LiNeBrEaKTo add insult to pain, for years Utah farmers have been struggling to make ends meet. Most have day jobs to supplement their incomes, and as choice farmlands are plowed under for housing developments, farmers are being pushed out to marginal lands.LiNeBrEaKA savings of any kind helps the bottom line, and one of the areas their counterparts in other parts of the country rely on is being more energy efficient. Koon calls the drop in gasoline prices only a temporary reprieve from agriculture's high energy costs, and energy experts say there is no magic bullet that will end the nation's dependence on foreign oil.LiNeBrEaKSo, a variety of renewable sources probably will be part of the answer to America's energy problems, according to Tom Potter of the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project and other conservationists.LiNeBrEaKBut running counter to this notion is the Utah Farm Bureau, with its 21,000 members, which insists that the nation must exploit its own oil and coal stocks for the foreseeable future. Because farm leaders aren't convinced there is such a phenomenon as global warming, they see no need to press for wide use of renewable fuels that in their minds may be decades away from being a cost-effective alternative to coal and oil.LiNeBrEaK"There are those in the media ...who claim consensus -- 'that man's activities are the cause of global warming," wrote Farm Bureau CEO Randy Parker in the group's December newsletter. Parker said this claim is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose members are "promoting parochial political agendas."LiNeBrEaKTime at state farm conventions is spent assailing global warming assertions -- leaving it up to individual farmers to develop alternative strategies on their own. The political debate aside, high energy costs probably will require farmers to retool their infrastructure, and with it the infrastructure of the nation's food supply.LiNeBrEaKThis isn't the first time farmers have been forced to confront change. In the 1970s, U.S. producers switched from gasoline to diesel-powered farm equipment. And today, in the face of tight operating margins, some farmers are embracing energy conservation.LiNeBrEaK"I got the message more than 30 years ago that I needed to do everything I could to make my farm energy efficient," said Sevier County alfalfa grower Eric Tuft. "If our nation had done the same thing, we wouldn't have gotten ourselves in this mess."LiNeBrEaKTuft, 58, began changing his operation in 1973, during the Arab embargo. About the same time, Utah Power and Light increased its rates, eventually tripling costs for Tuft's 100 horsepower irrigation pump.LiNeBrEaKNeither the oil consortium nor his local utility company "showed any mercy," he said.LiNeBrEaKTuft attended energy workshops, read books and later surfed the Internet. He began by investing in a gravity-based irrigation system and low-pressure sprinklers. If he hadn't replaced his old irrigation pump, he'd be paying utility bills of $3,000 to $4,000 each month.LiNeBrEaKHe also went to newer, no-till farming methods and recycled crankcase oil to heat the barn. Today, his farm power bills are about $200 a month.LiNeBrEaKAbout three years ago, Tuft began making his own bio -diesel when a cousin opened a Winger's restaurant in Richfield. Tuft collected the used soybean vegetable oils and experimented to get the right formula.LiNeBrEaKBiodiesel, which performs similarly to petrodiesel, can be produced from virtually any kind of vegetable oil -- new or used. The U.S. Department of Energy says that U.S. restaurants produce as much as 5 billion gallons of waste vegetable oil each year.LiNeBrEaKTuft mixes his biodiesel with petroleum-based diesel, using a 4-to-1 ratio. His production costs are about 40 cents a gallon -- and when petrodiesel went up to $4 per gallon or more, each time he filled up the 100-gallon tank on his hay cutter, he saved $72.LiNeBrEaKAnd, yes, the exhaust smells a little like french fries.LiNeBrEaKUtah farmers could make steps toward fuel self-sufficiency for the 11 million gallons of diesel they burn each year by growing their own oil-seed crops. They could plant safflower, which could be used as a rotation crop on dry (non-irrigated) wheat farms, as well as camelina, canola or sunflower, said David Drake, Sevier County Extension agent. And after extracting the oils, the seed mill byproduct could be fed to livestock.LiNeBrEaKDrake visits farms and fairs to demonstrate equipment that can be purchased for less than $10,000 to produce low-pollution, sustainable biodiesel fuels. The simple contraption consists of a seed press and two reactor tanks.LiNeBrEaKExisting technology also can cut energy costs substantially.LiNeBrEaKMoroni Feed Co., owner of the Norbest turkey brand, took advantage of financial assistance and technical advice from Rocky Mountain Power to install a computer-controlled refrigeration system and a high-efficiency evaporative condenser with variable speed fan control in its processing plant in Moroni. In addition to saving nearly $80,000 per year in energy costs, the farm cooperative also received incentives of $230,000 to help pay for the upgrades.LiNeBrEaKOn individual operations, farmers are advised to conserve energy in small ways before getting into more complex technologies. They can start by replacing incandescent lights with compact fluorescent bulbs. For larger operations, LED (light-emitting diode) bulbs are the next-generation option. A single spotlight costs up to $45 but uses 90 percent less energy than an incandescent bulb and when turned on for eight hours each day can last up to 17 years, said Jeff Dunn, with Blue Star Lighting, a wholesale distributor in Salt Lake City.LiNeBrEaK"The math shows great savings just in replacement costs alone," he said.LiNeBrEaKdawn@sltrib.com	FARMERS and RANCHERS (93%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (90%); RURAL DEVELOPMENT (90%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); SOLAR ENERGY (89%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY REGULATION (78%); OIL and GAS PRICES (77%); HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (77%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (77%); GRANTS and GIFTS (77%); AGRICULTURAL LENDING (73%); HYDROELECTRIC POWER (72%); ENERGY RESEARCH (72%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (72%); GASOLINE PRICES (66%); PERSONAL FINANCE (62%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  		SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA (79%) UTAH, USA (97%); COLORADO, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	January 6, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Salt Lake Tribune   	Dawn House, The Salt Lake Tribune  	US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (54%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	Agriculture/Food  	20090104-ST-FARM-GRANTS-20090104  	ST

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	January 04, 2009 Sunday 	OCEANS COMPRISE A SEA OF TROUBLES  	FOCUS; Pg. B7  	1198 words  	Not much is known about the sea, it is said; the surface of Mars is better mapped. But 2,000 holes have now been drilled in the bottom, 100,000 photographs have been taken, satellites monitor the five oceans and everywhere floats fitted with instruments rise and fall like perpetual yo-yos. Quite a lot is known, and very little is reassuring.LiNeBrEaKThe worries begin at the surface, where an atmosphere newly laden with man-made carbon dioxide interacts with the briny. The sea has thus become more acidic, making life difficult, if not impossible, for marine organisms with calcium-carbonate shells or skeletons.LiNeBrEaKThese are not all as familiar as shrimps and lobsters, yet species such as krill, tiny shrimp-like creatures, play a crucial part in the food chain: kill them off, and you may kill off their predators, whose predators may be the ones you enjoy served fried, grilled or with sauce tartare. Worse, you may destabilize an entire ecosystem. LiNeBrEaKThat is also what acidification does to coral reefs, especially if they already are suffering from overfishing, overheating or pollution. Many are, and most are therefore gravely damaged.LiNeBrEaKSome scientists believe that coral reefs, home to a quarter of all marine species, may virtually disappear within a few decades. That would be the end of the rainforests of the seas.LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide affects the sea in other ways, too, notably through global warming. The oceans expand as they warm up. They are also swollen by melting glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets: Greenland's ice is on track to melt, which eventually will raise the sea level by about 23 feet. Even by the end of this century, the level may well have risen by seven-eighths of a yard, perhaps more.LiNeBrEaKFor the 630 million people who live within six miles of the sea, this is serious. Countries such as Bangladesh, with 150 million inhabitants, will be inundated. Even people living far inland may be affected by the warming: Droughts in the Western U.S. seem to be caused by changing surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific.LiNeBrEaKAnd then there are the red tides of algal blooms, the plagues of jellyfish and the dead zones where only simple organisms thrive. All of these are increasing in intensity, frequency and extent.LiNeBrEaKAll of these, too, seem to be associated with various stresses man inflicts on marine ecosystems: overfishing, global warming, fertilizers running from land into rivers and estuaries, often the whole lot in concatenation.LiNeBrEaKSome of the worrying changes may not be entirely the work of man. But one that surely has no other cause is the dearth of fish in the sea: Most of the big ones have now been hauled out, and the rest will be gone within decades if the pillage continues at current rates. Indeed, more than three-quarters of all marine fish species are below, or on the brink of falling below, sustainable levels.LiNeBrEaKAnother change is the appearance of a mass of discarded plastic that swirls around in two clots in the Pacific, each as large as the U.S. And the sea has plenty of other ills.LiNeBrEaKEach of these changes is a catastrophe. Together they make for something much worse. Moreover, they are happening alarmingly fast - in decades, rather than the eons needed for fish and plants to adapt. Many are irreversible.LiNeBrEaKIt will take tens of thousands of years for ocean chemistry to return to a condition similar to its pre-industrial state of 200 years ago, says Britain's most eminent body of scientists, the Royal Society. Many also fear that some changes are reaching thresholds after which further changes may accelerate uncontrollably.LiNeBrEaKNo one fully understands why the cod have not returned to the Grand Banks off Canada, even after 16 years of no fishing. No one quite knows why glaciers and ice shelves are melting so fast, or how a meltwater lake on the Greenland ice sheet covering six square kilometers could drain away in 24 hours, as it did in 2006. Such unexpected events make scientists nervous.LiNeBrEaKWhat can be done to put matters right? The sea, the last part of the world where man acts as a hunter-gatherer - as well as bather, miner, dumper and general polluter - needs management, just as the land does.LiNeBrEaKEconomics demands it as much as environmentalism, for the world squanders money through its poor stewardship of the oceans. Bad management and overfishing waste $50 billion a year, says the World Bank.LiNeBrEaKEconomics also provides some answers. For a start, fishing subsidies should be abolished in an industry characterized by overcapacity and inefficiency. Then governments need to look at ways of giving those who exploit the resources of the sea an interest in their conservation.LiNeBrEaKOne such is the system of individual transferable fishing quotas that have been shown to work in Iceland, Norway, New Zealand and the Western U.S. Similar rights could be given to nitrogen polluters, as they have been to carbon polluters in Europe, and to seabed miners on continental shelves. A system of options and futures trading for fish could also help.LiNeBrEaKQuotas work in national waters. But the high seas, beyond the limits of national control, present bigger problems, and many fear that the tuna, sharks and other big fish that swim in the open ocean will be wiped out.LiNeBrEaKYet international fishing agreements covering parts of the North Atlantic show that management can work even in such common waters - though the Atlantic tuna commission also shows it can fail. And where fishing cannot be managed, it must simply be stopped.LiNeBrEaKNothing did so much good for fish stocks in northern Europe in the past 150 years as World War II: By keeping trawlers in port, it let fisheries recover. A preferable solution today would be marine reserves, the more, and the bigger, the better.LiNeBrEaKIn a world whose demand for protein grows daily, the need to conserve stocks is plain. The remedies are not hard to grasp. Politicians, however, are supine. Few of them, especially in Europe, are ready to stand up to potent lobbies, except in small countries where fishing is so important economically that the threat of mass extinctions cannot be ignored.LiNeBrEaKYet the mass extinction, however remote, that should be concentrating minds is that of mankind. It is not wise to dismiss it where CO(-2) emissions, the other great curse of the oceans, are concerned.LiNeBrEaKIn the long run, the seas are the great sink for nearly all carbon. They may be able to help avert some global warming - for instance, by providing storage for CO(-2), by providing energy through wave or tidal power, or by somehow taking carbon out of the atmosphere faster than at present. They will, however, continue to change and be changed as long as man continues to put so much carbon into the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKSo far, the rising sea levels, dying corals and spreading algal blooms are only minor distractions for most people.LiNeBrEaKA few more hurricanes like Katrina, a few dramatic floods in the coastal cities of the rich world, perhaps even the shutting down of a part of the world's great conveyor belt of ocean currents, especially if it were the one that warms up Western Europe: any of these would catch the attention of policymakers. The trouble is that by then it may be too late.LiNeBrEaKFrom The Economist magazine. Copyright 2009 Economist Newspaper Ltd.

South Florida Sun-Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale)  	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	Deerfield students win robotics competition: Deerfield students win robotics competition  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	435 words  	Jan. 4--When the robotics team from Quiet Waters Elementary won first place in the eighth annual FIRST Lego League Robotics Competition in Pompano Beach, the 10 fifth-graders wiped out chairs on the way to claiming victory. LiNeBrEaK"We beat eighth-graders and stuff," said Emily Lima, 10, of the group's scramble to the stage.LiNeBrEaKWinning was no easy task. Ten-person teams from 25 schools wrote skits about climate change and used Lego software to program Lego figures to do as many tasks as possible in 150 seconds while demonstrating teamwork working on a board.LiNeBrEaK"They had to research the effects of global warming on the planet and come up with a solution," said Maryellen F. Pinzon, club mentor and teacher of gifted programs at the Deerfield Beach school. "Their idea was to float wind turbines over the ocean."LiNeBrEaKBut to beat out middle school competitors? That was especially sweet.LiNeBrEaK"We're going to cherish it for life," said Kaitlyn Ridgeway, 10.LiNeBrEaKThe club meets after school. Many members come five nights a week. They speak simultaneously, tossing ideas into a ferment that crystallizes around a single theme.LiNeBrEaKIn this case, the problem was global warming. The quest for a solution took them from the Museum of Discovery and Science in Fort Lauderdale to a beach cleanup. For help with programming, the Global Gladiators sought out club alumnus Aidan Pace of Pompano Beach High School.LiNeBrEaKAidan's brother Kyler, a Lego whiz, translated the proposed solution -- wind power -- into figurines. Then, with the Lego-provided program, they programmed the figures to turn off a light and deposit a polar bear in a tiny igloo and other tasks. As the clock ticked and the team worked, cheers of "Let's go G.G. Let's go!" won them teamwork points.LiNeBrEaKIn blue satin capes made by media clerk Gail Kolcz and crested helmets borrowed from Monarch High School's band, they performed a play about global warming written by Amanda Wacker and Emilia Kosonen -- who hugged her mom on the way to the stage.LiNeBrEaKThe trophy puts the team into the state competition in Melbourne Jan. 24 where, win or lose, they have been forever changed by simply taking part.

This is no ordinary winter.LiNeBrEaKI believe -- and you might want to put on a shawl before reading further -- that we are entering a new Ice Age.LiNeBrEaKWhen you look at it that way, all the hype about global warming makes total sense. LiNeBrEaKIt was a dodge. A smoke screen.LiNeBrEaKA snow job.LiNeBrEaKAl Gore was trying to protect us from the far more incontinent truth.LiNeBrEaKSee, dealing with a warmer climate isn't really scary.LiNeBrEaKSo the polar ice caps melt.

I'm tired of having to defrost my giblets each time I come back in from the cold.LiNeBrEaKSo many things would change for the worse with a new Ice Age.LiNeBrEaKLike Moon boots making a comeback. Those things are so ugly they make UGGs look attractive.LiNeBrEaKAnd I can see Paula Deen offering "Rump Roasts and Finger Sandwiches," a Food Network series based on Donner Party recipes.LiNeBrEaKIn a new Ice Age we might see the return of large, dangerous and formerly extinct creatures like the mastodon and the saber-toothed Nixon.LiNeBrEaKSpeaking of which, I actually thought I saw a woolly mammoth galumphing through my neighborhood the other day.LiNeBrEaKIt turned out it was just a fat guy in a puffy parka.LiNeBrEaKI hate the cold. I hate wearing long-underwear that won't stop pinching me in my private places.LiNeBrEaKBut most of all, I hate snow berms.LiNeBrEaKThe other day I tried to drive to the newspaper. But when I turned onto Lincoln, this snow berm that was in the middle of the road and taller than an NBA center trapped me in the wrong lane.LiNeBrEaKBy the time I could turn left, I was in Chewelah.LiNeBrEaKHave you noticed the unhealthy physiological changes caused by this winter without end?LiNeBrEaKThe dark, sunken eyes. Flesh pastier than the underbelly of a carp.LiNeBrEaKThe dazed look of confusion...LiNeBrEaKAnd that's just what I see staring back at me every morning in the bathroom mirror.LiNeBrEaKHey, the rest of you Spo-zombies aren't so great looking, either.LiNeBrEaKTHE FOLLOWING E-MAIL has arrived from Ron Wendle:LiNeBrEaK"You know the 'Near Nature. Near Perfect' branding the Chamber of Commerce crowd put on Spokane?" he wrote. "Well, I have a little phrase to add. 'Spokane: Where you get a daily workout in your driveway.'"LiNeBrEaKI hear you, Ron. The evil snowplow drivers have buried and reburied my driveway entrance so many times, I figure they're getting back at me for all the wisecracks I've written about the city street department.LiNeBrEaKQ: What's the difference between Spokane snow removal and the Iraq War?LiNeBrEaKA: The Iraq War has a much better exit strategy.LiNeBrEaKHERE'S AN IMPORTANT SURVIVAL LESSON about coping with the cold: Put your socks on first when dressing for the new Ice Age.LiNeBrEaKI learned this the hard way when I mistakenly left my socks for last one morning.LiNeBrEaKI had so many layers on that I could hardly bend over to get to my feet. So I sat down on the edge of the bed and made this superhuman lunge. The force slid me right off the bed and onto the floor.LiNeBrEaKWhoomph!LiNeBrEaKFrom downstairs my lovely wife, Sherry, wondered what had made that awful house-shaking noise.LiNeBrEaKNothing to worry about, I told her.LiNeBrEaKJust another wooly mammoth lumbering through the neighborhood.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	January 4, 2009 Sunday   FIRST EDITION	Cell phones ringing wild  	NEWS; Pg. A5  	274 words  	Remember when cell phone ringtones mostly advertised personal musical tastes (Beyonc&eacute;, Metallica, "The 1812 Overture") or parental pride (babies cooing)? The chance to make political statements with this seemingly omnipresent speaker system went largely unexploited. But that was before endangered species ringtones were born. LiNeBrEaKNow, from Siberia to the ski slopes of the French Alps, from Manitoba to Brazil, tens of thousands of phones howl, hoot, trill, screech, croak or emit the haunting song of whales.LiNeBrEaKThe Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group based in Arizona known more for litigating on behalf of endangered creatures than building a choral repertoire around them, introduced the ringtones in 2006 and has been counting downloads the way Billboard counts album sales. The new tally: 200,000, a milestone of sorts. (They are most popular, after the United States and Britain, in China and Iran.)LiNeBrEaKBumper stickers produce instant reactions, pro and con, said Peter Galvin, the center's conservation director. But with wildlife sounds, he added, "People don't already have their filters on for how they receive that information. It's powerful. Any kind of music or sound influences people and how people think."LiNeBrEaKRenditions of frogs and owls consumed researchers in the early days. But the list has expanded to include animals that, though not yet endangered, can belt it out with the best of them, like the pika, a rodent dwelling in the Southwestern mountains in the United States, whose cool climes are threatened by climate change. The killer whale and the Mexican gray wolf, both endangered, are Nos. 1 and 2 on the charts.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	January 4, 2009 Sunday   FOURTH EDITION	What we predicted last year  	NEWSWATCH; Pg. B4  	426 words  	Will Barack Obama be elected president of the United States?LiNeBrEaKNo. OK, we blew it. We wrote that "his lack of experience will be insurmountable in the post-9/11 politics of America." LiNeBrEaKWill Mike Huckabee become the GOP presidential nominee?LiNeBrEaKNo. He had momentum and was on the cover of news magazines, but we said Republicans would ultimately settle on a candidate more in tune with the times.LiNeBrEaKWill New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg declare a third-party candidacy for president?LiNeBrEaKNo. When columnists were writing that his candidacy was a sure thing, our take was that Bloomberg didn't have the proverbial fire in the belly.LiNeBrEaKWill Republicans regain control of Congress?LiNeBrEaKNo. Our prediction wasn't all that brave considering that the Democrats' November blowout took shape long ago, with the faltering economy and bad foreign policy decisions.LiNeBrEaKWill Congress crack down on steroid use in professional sports?LiNeBrEaKYes. Congress passed no bill, but high-profile congressional scrutiny and the threat of legislation led to beefed-up drug testing. MLB and the players association did vastly improve many of the league's rules regarding stricter drug-testing policies and cracking down on steroids and other illegal drugs.LiNeBrEaKWill the United States enact serious global warming legislation?LiNeBrEaKNo. We were right in saying that nothing would eventually get done but wrong in predicting that Congress would heed the dire warnings by 2,500 scientists and pass legislation that George W. Bush would veto.LiNeBrEaKWill the U.S. economy slide into recession?LiNeBrEaKNo. History will record that a recession began in December 2007. However, the slump might not have been declared a recession if not for the credit crunch that hit financial markets in September.LiNeBrEaKWill the price of a gallon of gas hit a new record?LiNeBrEaKNo. We were wrong, but gasoline prices are lower now than they were a year ago.LiNeBrEaKWill the unemployment rate in the U.S. go down?LiNeBrEaKNo. Unemployment rose to 6. 7 percent, as of November, from 5. 0 percent at the end of last year.LiNeBrEaKWill the local housing market recover next year?LiNeBrEaKNo. Measures of house sales, prices and building permits all fell in 2008.LiNeBrEaKWill Scott Rolen finish the season as a St. Louis Cardinal if he's still on the opening day roster?LiNeBrEaKNo. On Jan. 12, four months after his shoulder surgery, Rolen was sent to the Toronto Blue Jays for third baseman Troy Glaus.LiNeBrEaKWill the U.S. men win gold in basketball at the 2008 Olympics?LiNeBrEaKYes. The U.S. men, dubbed "The Redeem Team," lived up to the nickname and won the Olympic gold medal in impressive fashion, including an exciting gold medal game against Spain.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	January 4, 2009 Sunday   FOURTH EDITION	Transit needs require regional leadership and broad vision  	EDITORIAL; Pg. B3  	634 words  	Yes, bus lines and transit lines have been cut. But the failure of regional transit is more than a question of whether to cut certain lines because of budget shortfalls. It is not Metro alone that has failed; leadership has failed the St. Louis region.LiNeBrEaKCreating an urban environment that works for transit is one of the many actions that can determine the success or failure of a transit system. The leaders of Stockholm, Sweden, for example, realized in the 1950s that there would be suburban expansion and decided to construct train lines that ran from the center of the city like fingers on a hand. Between the fingers would be park space. LiNeBrEaKToday, Stockholm's transit system has 70 percent ridership to the city center. Quoting "Vision Stockholm 2030," the city's recently completed long-term planning report, Stockholm uses ". . . carbon-neutral transport . . . made possible through broad regional consensus and the development of new funding systems in cooperation with the state and the private sector."LiNeBrEaKThere is nothing like this in St. Louis, and what's worse is that there seems to be no debate about anything but the least visionary of questions. To succeed, transit requires a comprehensive system using buses, streetcars, trains and taxis. It is a simple solution, the principles of which have been used, with variation, for centuries and in most parts of the world. Pedestrians, bicycles, aircraft and automobiles and other means of getting around always are included.LiNeBrEaKA community in which public transit is successful also directs land development to complement the transit system. For example, a transit gathering point becomes a market space or public square. A comprehensive system is essential; the best ones also are layered so that people have a number of options for getting to the same destination. LiNeBrEaKIt comes down to whether to continue with the one-dimensional automobile or to create a balanced transportation system. The ramifications for following either path are enormous.LiNeBrEaKIn part, it is national policy that has failed by focusing public infrastructure expenditures on the automobile. Looking at the "Ready to Go" project list of the Missouri Department of Transportation in response to proposals by President-elect Barack Obama, it is easy to see the emphasis on the automobile.LiNeBrEaKWithout the leadership to address new solutions, Metro is cutting services, and the response is to criticize Metro when the failure of transit actually is a larger problem of the management of the infrastructure in society. The local media, MoDOT (which more aptly should be called the Department of Highways), the East-West Gateway Council of Governments and the leaders of local government and business all are silent.LiNeBrEaKIn the face of two wars, an economic crisis, an uncertain energy supply and global warming, it is not a time for business as usual. We need major changes in the region's transportation system to address these problems - and changes statewide as well.LiNeBrEaKOf course, a few people do very well with the old policies that have been shaped to favor their interests. In many ways, it is no different than the alleged schemes of Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and accused New York financier Bernard Madoff and the rest of the global economic meltdown now in play. It is the core of the problem: real change or the continuation of policies that benefit a few, instead of serving the broad interests of everyone.LiNeBrEaKAs world events clearly show that we should be doing a better job of offering alternatives to the automobile, it is madness to be doing the exact opposite. Yes, Metro has been mismanaged and does not deserve the trust of the citizens. But it also is time to hold accountable the people and policies that have pushed St. Louis into this untenable position and that threaten America, too.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	January 4, 2009 Sunday   FOURTH EDITION	our predictions for 2009  	NEWSWATCH; Pg. B1  	722 words  	We asked our resident experts to gaze into the future and predict whether each of the following possibilities will happen in the next 12 months. Plus, see how we fared in our predictions for 2008, inside on B4.LiNeBrEaKWill 4 million to 5 million people show up for Barack Obama's inauguration Jan. 20, as the mayor of Washington and other officials have predicted?LiNeBrEaKNo. But 2 million to 3 million will turn out for this historic day, still surpassing the record for inaugurations and other such ceremonial gatherings in the United States. LiNeBrEaKWill Obama's honeymoon with the news media last long into 2009, adding credence to the suggestion that the press was biased toward him?LiNeBrEaKNo. This relationship is primed for some quick friction and an early breakup given Obama's tendency toward arrogance and the media's need to ask hard questions every day.LiNeBrEaKWill Obama make good on his threat to "throw his weight around" and force major college football to have a real national championship playoff?LiNeBrEaKNo. The president-elect is just like the rest of us. He hates the current BCS system for determining the "national champion" of college football. But he will be preoccupied with far more important issues.LiNeBrEaKWill Missouri's senior politician, U.S. Sen. Christopher "Kit" Bond, decide not to seek re-election in 2010?LiNeBrEaKNo. Even though he turns 70 this year and knows that the GOP likely will remain in the minority in Congress, Bond will decide that his work on the Intelligence Committee is more interesting than growing chestnuts back on the farm in Missouri.LiNeBrEaKIn Congress, will serious climate change legislation pass before health care reforms?LiNeBrEaKNo. Each will take up loads of time in D.C. this year, but steps toward repairing our costly, inefficient health care system will come first because the environment moves off the front burner in a bad economy.LiNeBrEaKWill Congress pass a massive stimulus package authorizing more than $800 billion to repair the economy and put people to work?LiNeBrEaKYes. But it won't happen within a few days of Obama's inauguration, as many predict, because of concerns from Senate Republicans about how all of that money will be spent.LiNeBrEaKWill the recession end?LiNeBrEaKYes. Most economists think the aggressive actions taken by the Federal Reserve, along with fiscal stimulus provided by the new Congress, will get the economy growing again in the second half of the year. But we probably won't know for sure that we're on a recovery path until sometime in 2010.LiNeBrEaKWill gasoline prices remain below $1. 50 a gallon?LiNeBrEaKNo. They won't go back to the record levels we saw this past summer, but a recovering economy should push them up a bit.LiNeBrEaKWill we experience deflation?LiNeBrEaKNo. We may see some months where the Consumer Price Index falls, as it did in October and November, but by the end of the year it will be slightly positive.LiNeBrEaKWill unemployment be higher a year from now?LiNeBrEaKYes. Most economists think the U.S. jobless rate will rise to 8 percent or higher, from a recent reading of 6. 7 percent. St. Louis' rate is likely to remain higher than the national one.LiNeBrEaKWill the Rams rehire Jim Haslett as head coach?LiNeBrEaKNo. Even though Haslett has established a strong working relationship with new general manager Billy Devaney, Devaney will conduct an extensive coaching search and will find a new coach who probably won't be a big name but will help turn the Rams into a much-improved team in '09.LiNeBrEaKWill Tiger Woods return to his old dominant form in 2009 after knee surgery cut short his '08 season?LiNeBrEaKYes. Woods will likely return to the PGA Tour at the Masters in April. A notorious workout fiend, he will come back stronger than before and win at least one of golf's majors.LiNeBrEaKWill the New York Yankees buy themselves a World Series title?LiNeBrEaKNo. After spending more than $400 million to sign three free agents this off-season - CC Sabathia, Mark Teixera, and A.J. Burnett - and with an annual payroll exceeding $210 million, the Yankees still will come up short.LiNeBrEaKour experts Bill Lambrecht o Washington bureau chief blambrecht@post-dispatch.comLiNeBrEaKBryan Burwell o Sports columnist bburwell@post-dispatch.comLiNeBrEaKDavid Nicklaus o Business columnist dnicklaus@post-dispatch.comLiNeBrEaKmore online Predict the future STLtoday.com/talk o Reporters take a stab at predicting the new year.

St. Joseph News-Press (Missouri)  	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	2012: The end of the world?  	LIFESTYLE  	1393 words  	Jan. 4--How would the governments of our planet prepare 6 billion people for the end of the world?LiNeBrEaKThey wouldn't.LiNeBrEaKAnd that's the concern regarding Dec. 21, 2012, when the world as we know it has been predicted to come to an end. The prediction is based on the prophesy of an ancient Mayan calendar that abruptly ends on that date. It's a calendar that covers the span of 5,126 years with nearly the same accuracy of the atomic clock of today. When you add the fact that the year coincides with several other doomsday predictions, not to mention disturbing astrological, environmental and economic changes we are now witnessing, it's not surprising that the prediction is creating a buzz around the world.LiNeBrEaK"It's definitely a possibility," says Sarah Underwood, a St. Joseph resident. "Numerous things threaten the human race right now, like flu pandemic and the possibility of nuclear attacks. I hope it's not true," she adds, "because I definitely have plans beyond that time.LiNeBrEaKHollywood already has jumped on the bandwagon with the movie "2012" scheduled for worldwide release in July. Another movie, "2012: The War for Souls," is also in the works for this year. LiNeBrEaKA conference on 2012 in San Francisco sold out at $300 per person last year, attracting participants worldwide, adding fuel to the dozens of Web sites and books now addressing the subject.LiNeBrEaK"Normally, New Age platforms attract the interest of only the narrowest group of enthusiasts," wrote Louis Sahagun, for the Los Angeles Times. "But this one has been generating wider audiences."LiNeBrEaKAuthors Synthia and Colin Andrews hope to address public concerns over the prediction with their new book, "The Idiot's Guide to 2012." The book was released late last year and explains in detail many of the factors involved in the prediction.LiNeBrEaK"Our lifestyle is very clearly about to change," Colin Andrews says. "We are already seeing the financial collapse, the global population explosion, the resource problems, climate change. All of these trends we try to fit in the book."LiNeBrEaKTheir book explains the Mayan belief system and how they arrived at the date. They also explain some of the phenomenons we are now witnessing and how everything is interrelated. An extensive list of resources are provided at the end of the book for readers to learn more.LiNeBrEaK"I would encourage people to look at this more as a period of change in conditions," Colin Andrews says. "The date is what we are focused on, but it's less important than establishing some realization that change is occurring and we should be taking reasonable, sensible steps to see our way through that."LiNeBrEaKThe ancient Maya lived from 200 BC to 900 AD. They were an advanced society in Central America with a highly developed language, writing architecture and astronomy. The Andrewses say their calendar is significant today because the Mayans were accurately able to calculate huge sums and spans of time and predict future events by studying the cycles and rhythms of the solar system.LiNeBrEaK"There's actually 17 calendars we know about, and another five that are hidden and may be revealed in the next few years," Synthia Andrews says.LiNeBrEaKAll of the calendars measure different aspects of time but then interrelate in the Long Count Calendar. And that's the calendar all the hoopla is about. It's a complicated series of cycles, but the bottom line is that the calendars say this age will be destroyed and a new age will begin. Not all experts agree with the interpretation of the exact date, the Andrewses say, but for the ancient Maya, we are on the path and the cosmic plan is unfolding as designed.LiNeBrEaKOne of the reasons the 2012 doomsday prediction is being taken more seriously than others, the Andrewses say, is the very real earth changes going on now along with major signs of an imbalance of nature, including:LiNeBrEaKSuper volcanos: A super volcano is as powerful as 1,000 Hiroshima-type nuclear bombs, the Andrewses say, with the most recent one exploding in 3500 BC in Greece. But in 1993, the largest super volcano hot spot ever discovered was found in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. It covers 136 acres and lies under the glacial lake. The area under the lake has been rising since 2004, forming a bulge indicating activity. Water temperatures have been rising. Nobody knows when it will blow, but some predictions are 2012. The biggest problem is that the volcano is fueled by underground accumulations of radioactive uranium. If it blows, ash clouds will block the sun, among other things, plunging us into a "nuclear winter."LiNeBrEaKCracks in the earth's magnetic field: The earth's magnetic field forms a shield around the earth to protect it against harmful solar radiation. Colin Andrews says NASA has confirmed recently that there is a tear in the earth's magnetic field. The tear is due to changes in the earth's core that could also lead to a pole reversal causing extreme weather conditions.LiNeBrEaKCelestial alignment: Our solar system has been passing through the galactic equator. John Major Jenkins, a Mayan researcher and author, believes the Mayans created their calendar to end on Dec. 21, 2012, to match the alignment on that day. He claims that the rising of the solstice sun will be in alignment with the center of the Milky Way galaxy and will eclipse it. During that time the emissions from the center of the galaxy will be interrupted.LiNeBrEaK"For anyone that questions the prophesy, the date and timing is within 30 seconds of NASA calculations," Colin Andrews says. "So they knew something, and with that alone, one needs to look at everything they are saying."LiNeBrEaKEpidemics and diseases are on the rise as the prophecies foretell, the Andrewses say. This includes a disturbing variety called Morgellons as they describe in the book: "A person will start to itch, get nasty sores on his or her skin and then feel something alive and moving underneath the skin. The moving things eventually erupt through the skin as multicolored fibers."LiNeBrEaKMorgellons was discovered in 2001 and is just now being investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At present, there is no cure. The analysis of the fiber is what has everyone concerned, Colin Andrews says, because it's not a known material. The theory the Andrewses say has the most evidence is that it's from genetic alterations (in genetic engineering), particularly in the agrobacterium that may have escaped the lab.LiNeBrEaKThe Andrewses admit much of this sounds like a sci-fi movie and there are numerous prophesies that have been made that never come true. That's why some people, such as Tony Meyer of St. Joseph, are remaining skeptical about 2012.LiNeBrEaK"I don't believe in those kind of things," he says. "I would put it right up there with psychics and mind-readers. But If I'm wrong, I would imagine there's not going to be anyone around to say 'I told you so.'"LiNeBrEaKThe Andrewses say whether you believe the prophesy or not, there are things we should do.LiNeBrEaK"If I had a direct line to Obama today," Colin Andrews says, "I would be saying two things: There is ample evidence that we are part of the trouble from man's actions and lack of respect for our surroundings. And how we consume on a vast scale across the spectrum is something that needs to be changed urgently."LiNeBrEaKHe says he would also encourage the president to make the resources available quickly and urgently for detailed major civil emergency planning to be available at all levels of government. On an individual level, the Andrewses have several chapters of suggestions, including getting in touch with your spiritual side and beginning preparation for what one should do for any disaster. They also will be continually updating their research on their Web site, www.colinandrews.net.LiNeBrEaK"Take a broad perspective and take common-sense steps and evaluate everything for yourself," Colin Andrews suggests. "Question everything. Forget 2012 as a date, but as a period and target for improvement in life and the way we conduct ourselves."

That was enough then, during the Great Depression, when most Oregon families earned less than $30 a week. But it's not any longer. The next Legislature should raise Oregon's lowest-in-the-nation minimum corporate tax. Ten bucks doesn't buy what it used to.

BAYLIFE MAGAZINE; Pg. 19  	742 words  	KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED (ALL 10 OF 'EM)LiNeBrEaKBy MARK HETTSLiNeBrEaKUniversal Press SyndicateLiNeBrEaKDear Readers,LiNeBrEaKMr. HandyPerson yields to Mark A. Hetts this week for a few comments about the new year.LiNeBrEaKLast year was rough for a lot of people, with the economy sputtering, people losing their homes, more than a half-million jobs lost in November, and the number of people in the United States without health insurance soaring to nearly 47 million.LiNeBrEaKOur children (or siblings, spouses or parents) in the armed services are still in jeopardy in two wars. Natural disasters and armed conflicts throughout the world are causing untold millions of casualties and refugees. And in spite of mind-boggling strides in science and agricultural technology, children around the globe were still starving in 2008. In my younger years, I thought we'd have that one whipped by now. LiNeBrEaKIt's been decades since I looked forward this keenly to the end of one year and the beginning of another. And I'm sure I'm not alone in that. I know flipping the December calendar page to January didn't change anything, but still, it felt good.LiNeBrEaKWhen I start seeing the world as bleak and frightening as I have at times in 2008, I've learned over the years that avoiding being immobilized by fear and grief lies in making a conscious - sometimes quite difficult - choice to cultivate some genuine gratitude. If necessary, to get myself started, I acknowledge a few potential scenarios where things could have been considerably worse than they have been or are. I learned the hard way many years ago to never say (or think), "Things can't get any worse than this." They can, do and may again. So, for starters, I'm thankful many things are not worse.LiNeBrEaKRegardless of one's political leanings, isn't it a good thing to live in a country where voters can change the government without bloodshed or civil war? I also think it's remarkable and encouraging to have witnessed in my lifetime the election of a person of color to the highest office in the United States. For old goats like me, it's a historic event. But for children everywhere, it's a lesson and an inspiration.LiNeBrEaKI'm grateful to see science, technology and human ingenuity directed at global climate change. I worry about how late we as a species have come to understand the need to nurture and respect our small, beautiful planet, but we had to start somewhere. Now is good.LiNeBrEaKStepping down from global to personal, how can I not be grateful that in my six decades I have rarely been hungry or without a decent roof over my head? I have made close friends and helped friends in need. And friends will make sure I don't go hungry or homeless, as they have done in the past when I came close.LiNeBrEaKSomehow, despite terrible things that sometimes happen in the world, I've kept a sense of humor. It has saved my life.LiNeBrEaKI've had some health issues in recent years, but who hasn't? I'm glad my brain mostly still works, I can see out of both eyes, and my hearing, taste and smell are still operable. After years of working with hand and power tools, I still have 10 fingers and two hands capable of fixing, building and creating things. I'm able to pet dogs and cats, shake hands with people, scratch my head and applaud when something or someone delights me.LiNeBrEaKI am, to be sure, profoundly grateful that I am still capable of being delighted and can find things daily to be delighted about. Recently, the two stunning parrots who visit the bird feeder in the backyard disappeared for a few weeks, and I worried something had happened to them. Well, something did happen. They returned after a month with a slightly fluffy, clumsy, goofy, big-eyed chick. While the parents clung to the feeder, seriously eating seeds, the little clown was climbing backward and forward around the feeder, begging for food and hanging upside down by one foot. It was hilarious and endearing. It was delightful.LiNeBrEaKThank you for reading this column week after week. Thank you for your letters and the kindness you express in them. My wish is that you all have love, laughter, peace and delight in your life in 2009 and that you keep your sense of humor, too. We're all going to need it.LiNeBrEaKHappy New Year.LiNeBrEaKShare your home repair problems, interesting questions, funny experiences and useful tips by writing to Mr. HandyPerson, c/o Universal Press Syndicate, 4520 Main St., Kansas City, MO 64111.

Vallejo Times Herald (California) 	January 4, 2009 Sunday 	Bay envisions new era in ferry transportation, but it won't be cheap  	LOCAL  	759 words  	Bay Area residents cherished the rush of riding ferry boats across the region's blue highways before eight major bridges spanned Bay waters.LiNeBrEaKThen, ferries' popularity surged after accidents or earthquakes disabled bridges or blocked highways. Vallejo's ferry service, which grew after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, is used by thousands of riders every week.LiNeBrEaKBut elsewhere, public interest in ferries waned. LiNeBrEaKBay Area transportation managers want to rekindle the ferry fervor, proposing a $400 million expansion to add seven routes on the Bay and to triple ridership to 12 million a year.LiNeBrEaKCommuters from Richmond, Berkeley, Antioch, Hercules, Martinez and Redwood City could be hopping 31 new ferries to San Francisco by the end of the decade.LiNeBrEaK"Ferries are going to be another key component of transportation in the Bay Area," state Sen. Mark DeSaulnier said.LiNeBrEaK"I expect more money for transportation, and I expect ferries to be part of the transformation of our transportation system," added the Concord lawmaker, a member of a key Senate budget committee on transit funds.LiNeBrEaKFerries could ease highway congestion, cut smog and global warming gases and reduce commuters' stress by luring drivers onto what transit experts call more relaxing, scenic boats.LiNeBrEaKAn invigorated ferry system also would provide essential emergency help to move firefighters, police, medical workers and stranded commuters if an earthquake paralyzes highways and public transportation systems, supporters say.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think we've optimized the use of the Bay (for commuting)," said Jon Stanley, executive director of the Water Emergency Transportation Authority, the agency created a year ago to coordinate Bay Area ferry planning. "We're trying to get people out of their cars and onto the ferry, even if it's not huge numbers."LiNeBrEaKRecent legislation, Senate Bill 796, gives the agency the mandate and the charter to coordinate emergency cross-Bay transportation in the event of a disruption like a bridge going down.LiNeBrEaKFerry service expansion faces many barriers. The authority does not know where it will get all the money to develop and operate the expanded service, although agency managers expect to get $250 million in the next decade from Proposition 1B state transportation bond measure voters passed in 2006.LiNeBrEaKSome skeptics say ferries attract too few riders to justify the costs.LiNeBrEaK"Ferries are fun. Buses are boring, but they move more people. Most people can walk to a bus," said Robert Cheasty, an East Bay attorney who is president of Citizens for East Shoreline Parks. "Most ferries fail because of economic reasons. Ridership is never enough."LiNeBrEaKLand-use conflicts also can complicate ferry plans, which often call for big parking lots on valuable shoreline property and terminals placed over environmentally sensitive waters.LiNeBrEaKA planned eight-mile ferry service between Oakland's Jack London Square and South San Francisco is expected to begin in late 2010, after a new terminal is built at Oyster Point in South San Francisco.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental planning has begun on proposals for service from Richmond to San Francisco and from Martinez and Antioch to San Francisco. Planning has not yet begun on three other proposed ferry routes - from Redwood City to San Francisco and the East Bay; from Hercules to San Francisco; and from San Francisco to Treasure Island.LiNeBrEaKAntioch and Martinez leaders view ferry service as a way to reinvigorate their cities' long-struggling downtowns, located near ferry terminal sites used before bridges were built.LiNeBrEaKA ferry linked Martinez and Benicia from 1847 until 1962, when the Benicia Bridge opened. Since the 1990s, the city several times considered a ferry service, but the plans always fell through.LiNeBrEaKRidership can be a challenge, too.LiNeBrEaKRichmond had a ferry service to San Francisco run by the Red and White Fleet from September 1999 until November 2000, when it was discontinued for lack of passengers. The service averaged 45 riders a day when it needed 200 to be financially viable.LiNeBrEaKSpeed may have been a factor, Stanley said. The ferry was no speedboat at about 11 knots; it took about 45 minutes to reach San Francisco. The new agency's ferry clocks 25 knots and would take an estimated 30 minutes.LiNeBrEaKSome say that faster boats and public subsidies do not guarantee ridership will ever gain critical mass.LiNeBrEaK"I can see (the ferries being) an adjunct system, but I don't see the lavish spending they're talking about," Cheasty said. "One of the worst things they could do is spend a lot of money on a ferry system and not get the ridership and then have to close down."

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	January 4, 2009 Sunday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	'Green,' 'maverick' get bashed in word ban  	N; Pg. N5  	648 words  	By Jeff KaroubLiNeBrEaKThe Associated PressLiNeBrEaKDETROITLiNeBrEaKA movie about a "maverick," his journey "from Wall Street to Main Street," his "desperate search" for a "monkey" and a "game-changing" revelation about his "carbon footprint" probably would make the nation's word-watchers physically ill.LiNeBrEaKEspecially if it were the "winner of five nominations." LiNeBrEaKAll those words and phrases are on Lake Superior State University's annual List of Words to Be Banished from the Queen's English for Mis-use, Over-use and General Uselessness. The 34th version of the list was released Tuesday, which means, "It's that time of year again."LiNeBrEaKThe school in Michigan's Upper Peninsula selected 15 entries from about 5,000 nominations.LiNeBrEaKDespite the year's economic meltdown (which itself wasn't banished but don't rule it out for next year), the most entries came from the environmental category - for "green" or "going green."LiNeBrEaK"If I see one more corporation declare itself 'green,' I'm going to start burning tires in my backyard," wrote Ed Hardiman of Bristow, Va., in his submission.LiNeBrEaKNominators also had their fill of "carbon footprint" - the amount of greenhouse gases a person's lifestyle produces.LiNeBrEaKThe list wasn't overrun with politics despite the national election - no "change," for instance - but one simply couldn't escape the critics' wrath.LiNeBrEaK"I'm a maverick, he's a maverick, wouldn't you like to be a maverick, too?" wrote Michael Burke of Silver Spring, Md., in his entry for the label embraced by Republican presidential candidate John McCain.LiNeBrEaKAlso knocked was "first dude," a term adopted by Todd Palin, husband of McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.LiNeBrEaKWords related to the economy led to a few meltdowns.LiNeBrEaK"I am so tired of hearing about everything affecting 'Main Street,'\" wrote Stacey from Knoxville, Tenn. "I know that with the 'Wall Street' collapse, the comparison is convenient, but really, let's find another way to talk about everyman or the middle class, or even, heaven forbid, 'Joe the Plumber.'\" She provided only a first name in her bid to eradicate - or at least separate - "Wall Street" and "Main Street."LiNeBrEaKAlthough this year's sluggish economy and record rise in gas prices may have kept people closer to home, the word coined for it, "staycation," is "idiotic and rootless," said Michele Mooney of Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaKAn emoticon made the list for the first time. The strings of characters used in e-mails and text-messaging commonly represent a face, such as ;-) or :-0, but the school singled out an emoticon heart, formed with a "less than" symbol and the number 3.LiNeBrEaK"Monkey" was on the list because of what some see as its rampant use as a suffix. "Especially on the Internet, many people seem to think they can make any boring name sound more attractive just by adding the word 'monkey' to it," wrote Rogier Landman of Sommerville, Mass.LiNeBrEaKThe school's annual quest to throw lexicon logs on the fire always gets some end-of-the-year attention for the school in Sault Ste. Marie, the last stop before Michigan's northern border crossing with Canada. But the list is more about letting off steam and offering laughs than performing any verbal vanishing act.LiNeBrEaK"We get several nominations for the same word or phrase, and we still get nominations for words and phrases that have been on previous years' lists," said university spokesman Tom Pink. " 'At this point in time' was on the first list in 1976, and it continues to be nominated every year. People still hate it."LiNeBrEaKThink these gendarmes of jargon should "get a life"? Watch it, kiddo. That phrase was banished in 1997.LiNeBrEaKbanned!LiNeBrEaKLake Superior State University's 2009 list of banished words:LiNeBrEaKgreenLiNeBrEaKcarbon footprint or carbon offsettingLiNeBrEaKmaverickLiNeBrEaKfirst dudeLiNeBrEaKbailoutLiNeBrEaKWall Street/Main StreetLiNeBrEaKmonkeyLiNeBrEaK&lt;3 (emoticon for 'heart' used in text messages and e-mail)LiNeBrEaKicon or iconicLiNeBrEaKgame changerLiNeBrEaKstaycationLiNeBrEaKdesperate searchLiNeBrEaKnot so muchLiNeBrEaKwinner of five nominationsLiNeBrEaKit's that time of year again	US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (86%); EMISSIONS (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); CAMPAIGNS and ELECTIONS (76%); PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (76%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (76%); ELECTIONS (75%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (74%); POLITICS (69%); US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (69%); TEXT MESSAGING (60%); OIL and GAS PRICES (50%)  	TODD PALIN (53%); JOHN MCCAIN (53%); SARAH PALIN (52%)  	DETROIT, MI, USA (90%) MICHIGAN, USA (90%); ALASKA, USA (79%); TENNESSEE, USA (79%); MARYLAND, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (90%)  	January 4, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Landmark Communications, Inc.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	January 4, 2009 Sunday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	Green technology even more critical in tough economy  	BUSINESS; Pg. D2  	567 words  	As Virginia businesses weather one of the most unpredictable economic climates in recent history, they are looking for ways to operate more efficiently to prepare for future success. With volatile fuel and energy costs, company leaders simply cannot afford to ignore technologies that will support more environmentally sustainable business practices. LiNeBrEaKEvery day, each of us has the opportunity to make a small difference in the choices we make, from how we work and where we work to the tools we use to get our jobs done effectively.LiNeBrEaKInvesting in "green" technology does not mean compromising on profitability, and today's software innovations are enabling companies to operate with greater efficiency in terms of both environmental impact and business productivity.LiNeBrEaKThere are small steps people can take to make a major impact on the environment. For example, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, companies can save about $50 each year for every desktop computer upgraded to Windows Vista. From an environmental perspective, configuring just 10 systems with power management tools in the operating system is the equivalent of taking one car off the road. If implemented widely enough, these power-management tools could decrease the nation's energy bill by $500 million and eliminate 3  million tons of global-warming pollution.LiNeBrEaKThe Coast Guard, which operates one of its full-time training centers in Yorktown, found out firsthand the value of upgrading its operating systems. By using the Microsoft Office OneNote 2007 digital note-taking feature, the Coast Guard created a paperless lecture and note-taking environment. Professors digitize lectures and streamline instructions, eliminating the need to print 500-page handbooks for students. This environmentally sound practice also means students can carry all necessary information in a simple flash drive.LiNeBrEaKBusiness travel can be taxing on the budget and the environment. Technology, such as unified communications, empowers people to work remotely, reducing the need for unnecessary travel. Unified communications uses software to unite voice, e-mail, instant messaging and video&shy;conferencing into a single platform that replaces traditional communication systems. By applying unified communications throughout an organization, employees can work seamlessly and collaboratively from various locations. Current videoconferencing experiences are so rich that people can easily meet with colleagues or customers without sacrificing the benefits of face-to-face interaction.LiNeBrEaKAnother accelerating technology trend is virtualization. In essence, virtualization works behind the scenes to consolidate underutilized servers, creating a far more efficient information technology infrastructure. This capability contributes to a need for less space to house servers and requires fewer kilowatt hours of power to operate them, resulting in monetary savings and a reduction of energy consumption. A recent study found that virtualization can reduce energy consumption by up to 90 percent.LiNeBrEaKInvesting in ecologically friendly technology benefits the health of your business and the environment. Being a responsible citizen no longer works in opposition to operating as a profitable business; and in today's challenging economic climate, this is certainly good news.LiNeBrEaKFor more information about environmental sustainability, visit www.microsoft.com/environment.

The Washington Post 	January 4, 2009 Sunday   Met 2 Edition	Tone May Be Key to Obama's Agenda;  Success May Hinge on Changing Status Quo 	A-SECTION; Pg. A01  	1894 words  	Rarely have lawmakers confronted an agenda as ambitious as the one Congress will face upon convening this week, with an incoming president pushing to stabilize an economy on the brink of long-term recession, to create universal health coverage and to overhaul federal energy policies.LiNeBrEaKThere are signs that the usual divisions that send so many ambitious bills down to defeat will confront President-elect Barack Obama in his first weeks on the job. Some Republicans are spoiling for an early policy fight that will test Obama's mettle. Conservative House Democrats want to include statutory deficit-reduction language in a economic stimulus package that could cost $1 trillion. And Senate centrists have warned that the incoming administration's ambitious global warming legislation might be a non-starter.LiNeBrEaKOver the past 15 years, during which a large majority of current lawmakers were first elected to Congress, partisan feuding has reduced Congress's output to a bare minimum of must-pass measures. Party-line voting peaked during the Bush presidency, while productivity slumped. In 2008, the Senate voted the lowest number of  times since 1951, according to a Congressional Quarterly survey. LiNeBrEaKWith Republicans holding just enough seats to put the brakes on sweeping initiatives in the Senate, the fate of Obama's agenda may rest on his ability to deliver on another campaign pledge: to change the way Washington does business by adopting a more pragmatic and inclusive governing style. And as the nation's economic woes deepen, there are early indications that lawmakers may be willing to put aside precedent, as the incoming administration -- at least so far -- sends welcome signals to key constituencies.LiNeBrEaK"I'm encouraged by their talk. But their talk has to be followed up with action," said Rep. Baron P. Hill (D-Ind.), co-chairman of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of 47 fiscally conservative House Democrats.LiNeBrEaKRahm Emanuel, who recently resigned his House seat and will serve as Obama's chief of staff, said that a shift in sentiment is palpable and that the new administration plans to take full advantage. Lawmakers sense that the need for action is urgent, Emanuel said, and they recognize that Congress's dismal approval ratings will make them easy scapegoats if the gamesmanship continues. "You never allow a serious crisis to go to waste," Emanuel said. "People sense that we're at a different moment in time, and that you have to put aside preconceived notions and partisanship to solve problems."LiNeBrEaKCommittee leaders in both parties worked through the holidays on several initiatives, including a mammoth overhaul of the health-care system that is moving on a faster track than Obama officials had anticipated, and the stimulus bill, which lawmakers hope to have ready for the new president to sign soon after his swearing-in.LiNeBrEaKRepublicans will hold at least 41 Senate seats, enough to filibuster if they maintain discipline in their ranks. Soon after the election, Obama began to reach out to individual Republicans through phone calls and meetings led by Emanuel. Tomorrow the president-elect will meet with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and House Minority Leader John A. Boehner (Ohio), who have expressed skepticism about the cost, scope and timetable of the stimulus plan.LiNeBrEaKSenior Democratic aides said they are prepared for Obama to push for Republicans to be included in major policy negotiations, starting with the stimulus, as they unfold. The goal is to set a precedent with the economic package and store goodwill for subsequent battles.LiNeBrEaK"We are not going to be hampered by ideology in trying to get this country back on track," Obama said at a post-election National Governors Association meeting in Philadelphia. In his radio address yesterday, he spoke of the stimulus -- which he labeled the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan -- almost in apolitical terms. "I am optimistic that if we can come together to seek solutions that advance not the interests of any party, or the agenda of any one group, but the aspirations of all Americans, then we will meet the challenges of our time, just as previous generations have met the challenges of theirs," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKSen. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa), the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, is one of many GOP members eager for Congress to act big, for a change. He has spoken by telephone with Obama, a "welcome conversation," as the veteran lawmaker put it. But Grassley also is a realist, saying his party would be wise to reexamine its tactics.LiNeBrEaK"There's a reality for Republicans that with lesser numbers, we're going to have to pick and choose where we draw the line," Grassley said. He predicted, "There won't be as many lines drawn as in the past."LiNeBrEaKAs useful as GOP support could prove, Obama also is trying to become the first Democratic president since the mid-1960s to forge an effective working relationship with a big congressional majority of the same party. The last two Democratic presidents, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, saw their party leaders on Capitol Hill turn against them, leading to electoral disasters for the party in 1980 and in 1994. An energy crisis helped to do in Carter, while a failed health-care proposal contributed to a Republican congressional landslide two years into Clinton's first term.LiNeBrEaKObama will try to address both those issues while managing the largest global financial crisis since the Great Depression, along with the beginning of a U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq.LiNeBrEaKBut the economic downturn will represent the first test of Obama's relationship with congressional Democrats, potentially pitting him against the party's formidable wing of fiscal conservatives.LiNeBrEaKLeaders from both chambers sat down to work out details in meetings at the Capitol beginning in mid-December. With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) staking an early position in favor of a $500 billion stimulus, Obama's advisers spread the word that their plan would probably approach $850 billion.LiNeBrEaKThose numbers sent sticker shock through the Blue Dog caucus, which has crusaded for federal deficit reduction and which represents a large enough force to block just about anything, particularly if Republicans hang together in opposition.LiNeBrEaKAfter discussions with Emanuel and other top Obama advisers, Hill said, the caucus's leaders decided to "set aside our strong feelings about deficit reduction" to support the plan, but with some conditions. The group wants to insert statutory language in federal law instituting pay-as-you-go rules, which require spending cuts or tax increases to offset new federal programs.LiNeBrEaKWhen Democrats took control of Congress after the 2006 elections, Pelosi instituted House rules that required a "pay-go" principle to be considered. But they were routinely flouted over the past two years as the Bush White House objected to tight fiscal constrictions. In meetings after the November election, Obama advisers raised the idea of making pay-go a federal law, suggesting that Blue Dog demands would probably be met. But the president-elect's team has not specified how, and more importantly when, such a rule would take effect.LiNeBrEaKWith no answers yet, Hill said he has been tasked by congressional leaders with crafting language defining emergency situations in which pay-go rules could be ignored. Despite the economic crisis, many Blue Dogs are seeking early imposition of pay-go rules, even if it creates problems for funding initiatives such as health-care reform that Obama has argued are key to the nation's recovery.LiNeBrEaKOverhauling health care, to make it more efficient while extending coverage to more people, may represent Obama's biggest policy challenge. But he may have advantages that Democratic presidents lacked in the past.LiNeBrEaKObama allies are pushing the idea that a federal health-care solution is not a threat to the nation's fiscal stability but part of the solution because of its potential to unlock business growth, create jobs and ultimately provide cheaper care for more Americans.LiNeBrEaK"I really am optimistic, although pragmatically optimistic," said Chris Jennings, who represents health-care clients and was a longtime adviser in the Clinton White House. "There's a greater receptivity than there ever was, because people feel extraordinarily insecure right now."LiNeBrEaKSenate health committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) started to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive bill in the summer, and Republican and Democratic leaders have met for months as they begin to hash out a collective approach.LiNeBrEaKSome preliminary health-care measures are likely to end up in the stimulus bill, including a down payment on converting all medical records to an electronic format. Other immediate priorities for the short term include an expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program and reauthorization of Medicare physician payment rates.LiNeBrEaK"I'm going to be working on health-care reform from the get-go," Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) said in an interview. "We can't lose momentum here."LiNeBrEaKBy Obama's estimate, his proposal to move toward universal coverage would cost almost $65 billion a year, and his original plan was to finance it by raising taxes on the top 5 percent of income earners. But in recent weeks, the president-elect has raised the possibility of waiting for the Bush tax cuts to expire, rather than repealing them, which would drain some funding for his health-care initiative.LiNeBrEaKThat could sour some deficit hawks on the idea. "It's going to be very problematic to me unless they can tell me how it's going to be paid for," said Sen. Ben Nelson (Neb.), a leading centrist Democrat.LiNeBrEaKEnergy and environmental issues represent areas in which Democrats have high public approval but many competing ideas. In a mid-December Washington Post-ABC News poll, 84 percent of voters said Obama should push a federal program to rein in emissions from electric companies while funding more renewable energy resources. After the economy, the issue rated as the highest in priority when voters were asked what they wanted Obama and Congress to tackle.LiNeBrEaKAs a candidate, Obama advocated a 10-year, $150 billion plan to fund private efforts to find cleaner-burning renewable resources, in the hope of reducing reliance on foreign oil.LiNeBrEaKBut he is almost certain to face resistance to another proposal, to reduce emissions, particularly from coal-burning power plants in the Rust Belt. He supports a "cap-and-trade" policy that sets emission standards for all companies but allows those with larger emissions to buy credits from companies that burn less. Similar legislation has met with failure in the Senate, where it received 48 votes in June, a dozen shy of the 60 needed to clear a filibuster by lawmakers who say the policy would result in higher short-term energy costs for consumers.LiNeBrEaKThe good news for Obama is that some potential foes are willing to approach old debates with a fresh eye. Sen. Judd Gregg, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, is one GOP agitator who said he is encouraged by the burgeoning bipartisanship.LiNeBrEaK"The opportunity is there, but it's going to take a real diplomatic effort and effective procedure and leadership to pull it off," Gregg said. "You don't have to get too far into the waters of these issues to start aggravating the sharks."LiNeBrEaKStaff writer Ceci Connolly contributed to this report.LiNeBrEaKIMAGE; By Robert Galbraith -- ReutersLiNeBrEaKIMAGE; By David Mcnew -- Getty Images; These images exemplify the Obama administration's priorities: the housing market, the auto industry, energy and the environment, and health care.

The Washington Post 	January 4, 2009 Sunday   Bulldog Edition	Cash Guzzlers;  The costly contradictions in bailing out GMAC 	EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. B06  	457 words  	ARECESSION of unknown severity and duration now grips the United States and the rest of the world. In response, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have thrown out the free-market rulebook, pumping massive amounts of taxpayer money into the financial sector and the auto industry.  This year, there will probably be more federal intervention, in the form of spending on public infrastructure and perhaps a new infusion for the car companies as well. The argument for breaking all the capitalist taboos is that the alternative would be worse; once the economy has stabilized, the government will retreat, and both businesses and households will submit once again to the usual market discipline. LiNeBrEaKFair enough. But it's still wise to reflect, every so often, on the insidious costs of all bailouts, lest emergency measures evolve into standard operating procedure. Today's lesson in moral hazard has to do with the recent federal rescue of GMAC, the financial arm of General Motors -- which officially closed on the first $4 billion of a separate $13. 4 billion bailout on New Year's Eve.LiNeBrEaKThe Federal Reserve has allowed GMAC to convert itself into a bank, and Treasury promptly infused $5 billion -- plus another $1 billion to GM itself to buy more equity in GMAC. Grateful, GM has begun offering car buyers five-year,  interest-free financing deals through GMAC.LiNeBrEaKSounds great, until you consider which models GM seeks to move off its lots courtesy of this federal largess. For the most part, they are unpopular, gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicles, such as the 2008 Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy and Saab 9-7X. None of these cars gets better than 16 miles per gallon in city driving or 21 mpg on the highway. The biggest TrailBlazer model emits 14. 1 tons of greenhouse gases per year (about twice as much as a Toyota Camry). And car reviewers have given all of these vehicles poor marks for performance and reliability. With a price tag ranging from about $28,000 to $38,000, it's little wonder that annual TrailBlazer sales were down 42 percent through November or that Envoy ($31,000 to $36,000 apiece) sales were off 49 percent.LiNeBrEaKIn short, through the GMAC bailout, the U.S. government is enabling GM to overcome (or try to overcome) the market's resistance to its inferior merchandise -- and it is doing so in a way that directly clashes with public goals such as conserving energy and fighting global warming. Perhaps this will indeed be, as GM has vaguely promised, the last hurrah for the second-rate, U.S.-built SUV -- or perhaps the government has purchased GM a chance to fail at something new. Either way, it's another reason to look forward to the recession's end and to the swiftest possible decoupling of government and big business.

The Washington Post 	January 4, 2009 Sunday   Regional Edition	Global Warming Is Just the Tip of the Iceberg  	OUTLOOK; Pg. B03  	1330 words  	The Cold War shaped world politics for half a century. But global warming may shape the patterns of global conflict for much longer than that -- and help spark clashes that will be, in every sense of the word, hot wars.LiNeBrEaKWe're used to thinking of climate change as an environmental problem, not a military one, but it's long past time to alter that mindset. Climate change may mean changes in Western lifestyles, but in some parts of the world, it will mean far more. Living in Washington, I may respond to global warming by buying a Prius, planting a tree or lowering my thermostat. But elsewhere, people will respond to climate change by building bomb shelters and buying guns.LiNeBrEaK"There is every reason to believe that as the 21st century unfolds, the security story will be bound together with climate change," warns John Ashton, a veteran diplomat who is now the United Kingdom's first special envoy on climate change. "The last time the world faced a challenge this complex was during the Cold War. Yet the stakes this time are even higher because the enemy now is ourselves, the choices we make." LiNeBrEaKDefense experts have also started to see the link between climate change and conflict. A 2007 CNA Corp. report, supervised by a dozen retired admirals and generals, warned that climate change could lead to political unrest in numerous badly hit countries, then perhaps to outright bloodshed and battle. One key factor that could stoke these tensions is massive migration as people flee increasingly uninhabitable areas, which would lead to border tensions, greater demands for rescue and evacuation services and disputes over essential resources. With these threats looming, the U.N. Security Council held a precedent-setting debate on climate change in April 2007 -- explicitly casting global warming as a national security issue.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming could lead to warfare in three different ways.LiNeBrEaKThe first is conflict arising from scarcity. As the world gets hotter and drier, glaciers will melt, and the amount of arable land will shrink. In turn, fresh water, plants, crops and cattle and other domestic animals will be harder to come by, thereby spurring competition and conflict over what's left. In extreme examples, a truly desiccated ecosystem could mean a complete evacuation of a hard-hit region. And the more people move, the more they will jostle with their new neighbors.LiNeBrEaKSuch displacement can arise either suddenly or slowly. The growth of the Sahara, for instance, took many millenniums; many thousands of years ago, people were slowly nudged out of the inland region of northern Africa and into such great river valleys as the Nile and the Niger. Over time, incremental but prolonged rises in sea levels will also gradually uproot hundreds of millions of people.LiNeBrEaKBut sometimes the displacement happens with shocking speed: Just think of the deadly hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which together drove millions of people to suddenly leave Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. As global warming and population growth increase, we could see far deadlier storms than Katrina. In 1991, a cyclone in Bangladesh displaced 2 million people and killed 138,000.LiNeBrEaKAll this can lead to warfare when it's time for the displaced to find a new home. For most of human history, they could at least theoretically do so in unclaimed lands -- a sort of territorial pressure valve whose existence tamped down conflict. But today, this reservoir of vacant turf no longer exists, except in the least hospitable parts of the planet. So when the displaced start eyeing currently inhabited areas, expect trouble -- and the bigger the displacement, the bigger the fight.LiNeBrEaKThe second cause of the coming climate wars is the flip side of scarcity: the problems of an increase in abundance. Suppose that global warming makes a precious resource easier to get at -- say, rising temperatures in northern Canada, Alaska and Siberia make it easier to get at oil and gas resources in regions that had previously been too bone-chilling to tap. (A few degrees of change in temperature can transform a previously inhospitable climate.) But what happens if some tempting new field pops up in international waters contested by two great powers? Or if smaller countries with murky borders start arguing over newly arable land?LiNeBrEaKFinally, we should also worry about new conflicts over issues of sovereignty that we didn't need to deal with in our older, colder world. Consider the Northwest Passage, which is turning into an ice-free corridor from Europe to Asia during the summer months. Canada claims some portions of the route as its own sovereign waters, while the United States argues that these sections lie within international waters. Admittedly, it'd take a lot of tension for this to turn into a military conflict, but anyone convinced that the United States and Canada could never come to blows has forgotten the War of 1812. And not all this sort of resource conflict will occur between friendly countries.LiNeBrEaKOther kinds of territorial quarrels will arise, too. Some remote islands -- particularly such Pacific islands as Tuvalu, Kiribati, Tonga, the Maldives and many others -- may be partially or entirely submerged beneath rising ocean waters. Do they lose their sovereignty if their territory disappears? After all, governments in exile have maintained sovereign rights in the past over land they didn't control (think of France and Poland in World War II). Nor are these new questions far away in the future. The first democratically elected president of the Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed, is already planning to use tourism revenue to buy land abroad -- perhaps in India, Sri Lanka or Australia -- to house his citizens. "We do not want to leave the Maldives, but we also do not want to be climate refugees living in tents for decades," he told Britain's Guardian newspaper.LiNeBrEaKThe net result of these changes will be the creation of two geopolitical belts of tension due to global warming, which will dramatically shape the patterns of conflict in the 21st century.LiNeBrEaKFirst, politics will heat up along what we might call the equatorial tension belt, a broad swath of instability around the planet's center. This belt will creep southward, deeper into Africa, and extend far into central Asia.LiNeBrEaKSecond, a new tension belt will develop around the polar circles. In the short term, the main problems will arise in the Northern Hemisphere, but later in the 21st century, the area around the South Pole may also see increasing security strains as countries rush to claim and develop heretofore frozen areas. If the equatorial tension belt includes mostly poor, developing countries fighting over survival, the new polar tension belt will draw in wealthy, developed countries fighting over opportunity.LiNeBrEaKThis is, admittedly, a glum view of the future. But we can still avoid the new hot wars -- or at least cool them down a bit. For starters, we should redouble our efforts to slow down global warming and undo the damage humanity has already done to the environment. Every little bit helps, so by all means, hassle your senator and recycle those bottles.LiNeBrEaKBeyond that, we need to get our heads around the idea that global warming is one of the most serious long-term threats to our national and personal security. For the next two decades or so, the climate will continue to change: Historic levels of built-up greenhouse gases will continue to warm the world -- and spin it toward new patterns of conflict. So we need to do more than simply reverse climate change. We need to understand and react to it -- ordinary people and governments alike -- in ways that avoid conflict. Over the next few years, we may find that climate-change accords and peace treaties start to overlap more and more. And we may find that global warming is heating new conflicts up to the boiling point.LiNeBrEaKjlee@american.edu LiNeBrEaKJames R.

The Boston Globe 	January 3, 2009 Saturday   THIRD EDITION	Mass. launches effort to protect coast residents Rising sea levels pose a threat  	METRO; Pg. B1  	734 words  	Massachusetts is kicking off an innovative pilot program to defend the state's 78 coastal communities against rising sea levels and fiercer storms brought on by global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe state's Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs announced yesterday that seven communities have been selected to learn how best to adapt to climate change, by doing such things as elevating buildings in flood-prone areas, developing disaster plans for more frequent storms, and prohibiting construction in vulnerable areas.LiNeBrEaKBy getting the nod, Boston, Falmouth, Hull, Oak Bluffs, Duxbury, Kingston, and Plymouth will be able to tap into state technical expertise to figure out how to slow erosion, for example, or use laws or education strategies to reduce damage from sea level rise and more frequent storms. LiNeBrEaKThe move is part of a growing international effort to accommodate - not just prevent - higher temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and longer growing seasons from the release of heat-trapping gases from power plants, factories, and cars. New England winters have warmed more than 4 degrees in the last 30 years, bringing with them a host of changes from shifting distribution patterns of tree pests to economic troubles for ice fishing businesses.LiNeBrEaK"It's a step forward; I applaud them," said Paul Kirshen, a Tufts University professor and specialist in climate change adaptation. "All the research, including mine, shows it makes a lot more economic, environmental, and social sense to adapt rather than wait a few decades until the full impacts of climate change are felt."LiNeBrEaKIf fairly conservative climate projections hold true for Boston, global warming could raise sea levels enough by the end of the century that Boston Harbor will flood parts of East Boston and the Financial District during a typical winter northeaster. South Boston, Back Bay, and Cambridge could also flood during a Category-2 hurricane, according to simulations produced for the Globe in 2007 by a computer modeling consultant.LiNeBrEaK"A portion of the downtown areas of Plymouth and Duxbury are mapped as being underwater with the sea level rise," said Mark Sylvia, Plymouth town manager who becomes director of the Green Communities Division of the state's Department of Energy Resources in February. "The stability of our coastline is directly related to the sustainability of our current and future economic, recreational, and environmental resources." Duxbury, Kingston, and Plymouth will work together on one project.LiNeBrEaKAdapting to global warming has been discussed for years in low-lying island nations, Europe, and elsewhere around the world. But it was infrequently mentioned in the United States in part because the Bush administration was reluctant to acknowledge manmade climate change, let alone plan for it, climate experts say. They say the incoming Obama administration is likely to accelerate adaptation efforts.LiNeBrEaKAlso, cities and towns that wanted to prepare for climate change were often stymied because it was not entirely clear how much sea level would rise, or how many more fierce hurricanes, for example, New England would experience as worldwide temperatures rose.LiNeBrEaKAs a result, there are only a few instances of adaptation in New England: In 1988, Maine adopted a regulation requiring that anyone building on coastal dunes had to ensure that construction could withstand a 3-foot rise in sea level from global warming. And in Massachusetts, Boston's Deer Island Sewage Treatment Plant, completed in 2001, was built on land 2 feet higher than originally planned to avoid flooding by climate change.LiNeBrEaK"In the past, people said we can't take action now because we are uncertain about the future," said Kirshen.LiNeBrEaKHe said experts are getting better at working uncertainty into climate adaptation efforts, and hopes Massachusetts will remain sensitive to those uncertainties as it moves forward.LiNeBrEaKThe two-year pilot grant program, known as StormSmart Coasts, will help the communities evaluate ways to protect the state's 1,500-mile shoreline. It will focus on sea level rise and increased flooding events in the community.LiNeBrEaK"This program gives mayors, zoning boards, and emergency response teams the tools they need to plan for - and recover from - the impact of rising sea levels and severe coastal storms," said Ian Bowles, state Energy and Environment secretary.

Buffalo News (New York) 	January 3, 2009 Saturday   FINAL EDITION	It seems to us . . .;  Language mangling, deer holidays, a gas tax and one last memorial 	EDITORIAL PAGE; Pg. A6  	386 words  	HOPE WANES: Among the changes we really were hoping for as leadership shifts from Dubya to the Change Agent was a little more rhetorical skill in the White House. Seemed a natural, what with President Bush's infamous malaprops and mispronunciations, and President-elect Barack Obama's trumpeted skills in oratory. LiNeBrEaKBut then came the Christmas messages from both camps, and in unwrapping Obama's we came across a hope for "new innovations." Look, we're occasional language sinners, too -- it's hard not to be, considering how many words tempt us daily -- but the redundancy was jarring, considering the source. Here's hoping it's not a case of the more things change, the more things stay the same . . .LiNeBrEaKCHRISTMAS COMMUTE: The Christmas Eve drive home took one of us down Ohio Street. There, just a couple of blocks from the heart of downtown, the space between waterfront railroad tracks was being grazed by a small flock of wild turkeys -- and eight tiny reindeer.LiNeBrEaKAll right, they were just normal whitetail deer, but it was Christmas Eve and it was raining. Lighten up. We didn't ask the reindeer names -- we already knew.LiNeBrEaKUTTERLY UPSET: You may have heard of the farm tax (actually, we spelled that wrong, but intentionally). We're hearing a lot of talk about it, too, but it's usually wrong -- this isn't one of the many new fees and taxes Gov. David A. Paterson is proposing, so far as we know; it's a problem of national proportions.LiNeBrEaKThe Environmental Protection Agency has floated the idea of a regulation that would require farmers to buy emissions permits to cover cow flatulence, a significant source of the greenhouse gas methane. Really. Humans apparently are exempt, so far.LiNeBrEaKBut New York does have someone on the case. Sen. Charles E. Schumer has written the agency to get its leaders to burst this trial balloon before it goes any further. And scientists are working on adjusting cow diets to reduce the global warming risk, anyway. Really.LiNeBrEaKSOMBER NOTE: Last year was a particularly sad one here at The News. We lost three working journalists to illness or accident -- Paul Price, Jay Bonfatti and Tom Borrelli. All three spent their working lives bringing news and sports to you. You'll miss their work, but we can't turn the page on another year without remembering how much we miss them as friends.

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	Discovery Kingdom explores walruses' secret mating habits  	NEWS  	681 words  	Wild rides and wildlife shows are not all Vallejo's Six Flags Discovery Kingdom is about - there's a quiet scientific side behind the scenes, as well.LiNeBrEaKAnd that side is suddenly gaining new traction as the park's scientists work to help preserve the walrus, said spokeswoman Nancy Chan.LiNeBrEaKHolley Muraco, the park's marine mammal reproductive specialist, is working to study the breeding habits of walruses - something difficult to do in the wild. LiNeBrEaKThe efforts come at a time when the walrus' status in the ecological scheme of things is in question. The Center for Biological Diversity reportedly sued the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne last month for failing to act on a petition seeking protection for walruses under the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaKAlaskan walruses are threatened by global warming that melts the Arctic sea ice they use, and also by oil and gas development, according to the group.LiNeBrEaK"Polar bears are always the poster child for global warming, but what about the walruses?" Chan said.LiNeBrEaKBecause of the unique opportunity offered by the park, the breeding habits of Discovery Kingdom's 2,200 pound Pacific walrus Sivuqaq (the ancient Yupik name for the village of Gambell, Alaska) and his two female companions Uquq (blubber) and Sika (ice) have become the subject of some intense study. In fact, Muraco is creating an artificial vagina in the hope of interesting Sivuqaq in performing sexual acts that can be analyzed and quantified, she said.LiNeBrEaKIf everything goes according to plan, the male, nicknamed Jocko for his starring role in the Adam Sandler / Drew Barrymore film "50 First Dates," would by this means provide scientists their first walrus semen sample, Muraco said.LiNeBrEaKThough she's constructed similar body parts for horses, cows and pigs, those creatures' breeding habits are much less of a mystery. Pacific walruses, on the other hand, live in a remote part of the world and breeding activity takes place under water, making observation and study nearly impossible in the wild, Muraco said.LiNeBrEaKThe Discovery Kingdom walruses, whose mothers were killed during a hunt, came to the park from the Bering Sea as 2-week-old unrelated orphans about 14 years ago, Muraco said. They were hand-raised and trained by park experts, which is one reason it's even possible to do the various tests and examinations being performed, she said.LiNeBrEaKAny semen collected will act as a baseline for further study and can be frozen in the park's on-site sperm bank as a sort of insurance policy against the extinction of the species, Muraco said."We don't know what the future is going to be for these arctic species, so this is important," she said.LiNeBrEaK"There are about 30 walruses spread out among only seven facilities in the country, and if this works, we'll share information and techniques so we can add more data to compare," said Discovery Kingdom's animal care director, and Muraco's husband, Mike Muraco.LiNeBrEaK"We are ground zero here with regard to walrus breeding," Holley Muraco said. "It's a big, open area of study as it is with many exotic species."LiNeBrEaKOne reason the Muracos and other park animal experts started brainstorming walrus research ideas about a year ago, is the fact that though the walruses are sexually active, they have yet to produce offspring. This may be because of the animals' youth, but that's one answer the scientists seek.LiNeBrEaKWalruses like Jocko can grow to 4,000 pounds and typically live up to about 30 years, Mike Muraco said.LiNeBrEaKAs the walrus research goes forward, Holley Muraco will monitor the animals' hormones, use ultrasound, take blood tests and vaginal swabs to determine the females winter breeding cycle season, and watch them mate under water, in addition to making the latex or rubber artificial vagina into which semen can be collected. The trio are uncomplaining participants in the examinations and testing, she said.LiNeBrEaK"They're not shy with their sexuality," Holley Muraco said. "They're trained to cooperate with these exams. They just lay back and relax."LiNeBrEaK  E-mail Rachel Raskin-Zrihen at RachelZ@thnewsnet.com or call 707-553-6824.

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	New era in ferry travel planned for the Bay  	MY TOWN; Solano; Environment; Commuting; Contra Costa; News; Local  	1137 words  	Bay Area residents cherished the rush of riding ferry boats across the region's blue highways before eight major bridges spanned Bay waters.LiNeBrEaKThen, ferries' popularity surged after accidents or earthquakes disabled bridges or blocked highways.LiNeBrEaKBut when the bridges spanned the water, public interest in ferries waned.LiNeBrEaKBay Area transportation managers want to rekindle the ferry fervor, proposing a $400 million expansion to add seven routes on the Bay and to triple ridership to 12 million a year.LiNeBrEaKCommuters in Richmond, Berkeley, Antioch, Hercules, Martinez and Redwood City could be hopping 31 new ferries to San Francisco by the end of the decade. LiNeBrEaK"Ferries are going to be another key component of transportation in the Bay Area," said state Sen. Mark DeSaulnier, D-Concord, former chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee and a current member of a key Senate budget committee on transit funds. "I expect more money for transportation, and I expect ferries to be part of the transformation of our transportation system."LiNeBrEaKFerries could ease highway congestion, cut smog and global warming gases and reduce commuter stress by luring drivers onto what transit experts call more relaxing, scenic boats.LiNeBrEaKAn invigorated ferry system also would provide essential emergency help to move firefighters, police, medical workers and stranded commuters if an earthquake paralyzes highways and public transportation systems, supporters say.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think we've optimized the use of the Bay (for commuting)," said Jon Stanley, executive director of the Water Emergency Transportation Authority, the agency created a year ago to coordinate Bay Area ferry planning. "We're trying to get people out of their cars and onto the ferry, even if it's not huge numbers."LiNeBrEaKRecent legislation, Senate Bill 796, gives the agency the mandate and the charter to coordinate emergency cross-Bay transportation in the event of a disruption, such as a bridge going down.LiNeBrEaKThe big issuesLiNeBrEaKFerry service expansion faces many barriers. The authority does not know where it will get all the money to develop and operate the expanded service, although agency managers expect to get $250 million in the next decade from the Proposition 1B state transportation bond measure voters passed in 2006.LiNeBrEaKSome skeptics say ferries attract too few riders to justify the costs.LiNeBrEaK"Ferries are fun. Buses are boring, but they move more people. Most people can walk to a bus," said Robert Cheasty, an East Bay attorney who is president of Citizens for East Shore Parks. "Most ferries fail because of economic reasons. Ridership is never enough."LiNeBrEaKLand-use conflicts also can complicate ferry plans, which often call for big parking lots on valuable shoreline property and terminals placed over environmentally sensitive waters.LiNeBrEaKThe Albany City Council recently opposed a ferry site in that city   one of four alternative locations in Albany and Berkeley   because of concerns for the environment and the popular Eastshore State Park on the shoreline of Contra Costa and Alameda counties. The city spelled out its criticism in a comment letter it submitted on the environmental report for the proposed terminal.LiNeBrEaKThe site for the Albany or Berkeley terminal is scheduled to be selected by June 2009, and service to San Francisco is to begin in 2011. A planned eight-mile ferry service between Oakland's Jack London Square and South San Francisco is expected to begin in late 2010, after a new terminal is built at Oyster Point in South San Francisco.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental planning has begun on proposals for service from Richmond to San Francisco and from Martinez and Antioch to San Francisco. Planning has not begun on three other proposed ferry routes   from Redwood City to San Francisco and the East Bay; from Hercules to San Francisco; and from San Francisco to Treasure Island.LiNeBrEaKAntioch and Martinez leaders view ferry service as a way to reinvigorate their cities' long-struggling downtowns, located near ferry terminal sites used before bridges were built.LiNeBrEaKMartinez Mayor Rob Schroder said a ferryboat terminal would go hand in hand with efforts to attract retail business to the downtown.LiNeBrEaKA ferry linked Martinez and Benicia from 1847 until 1962, when the Benicia Bridge opened. Since the 1990s, the city several times considered a ferry service, but the plans always fell through.LiNeBrEaKSchroder said he believes Martinez has two advantages this time   as the county seat, the city could play a key role in recovery from a natural disaster or terrorist attack; and a ferry terminal may stimulate economic development in the city's ailing downtown.LiNeBrEaK"I truly believe that it's going to happen this time," he said.LiNeBrEaKObstacles aheadLiNeBrEaKBut Shroder acknowledged challenges to resurrecting ferry service in Martinez, including the considerable distance from the planned parking lot to the ferry terminal site and the terminal's distance from Highway 4.LiNeBrEaKRidership can be a challenge, too.LiNeBrEaKRichmond had a ferry service to San Francisco run by the Red and White Fleet from September 1999 until November 2000, when it was discontinued for lack of passengers. The service averaged 45 riders a day when it needed 200 to be financially viable.LiNeBrEaKSpeed may have been a factor, Stanley said. The ferry was no speedboat at about 11 knots; it took about 45 minutes to reach San Francisco. The new agency's ferry clocks 25 knots and would take an estimated 30 minutes.LiNeBrEaKSome say that faster boats and public subsidies do not guarantee ridership will ever gain critical mass.LiNeBrEaK"I can see (the ferries being) an adjunct system, but I don't see the lavish spending they're talking about," said Cheasty, of Citizens for East Shore Parks. "One of the worst things they could do is spend a lot of money on a ferry system and not get the ridership and then have to close down."LiNeBrEaKIn other words: What if taxpayers spend $400 million on a ferry system and nobody rides?LiNeBrEaKStanley is confident the system can attract riders. The key, he said, is making it competitive with motor vehicles and BART, with travel time, comfort and cost considered.LiNeBrEaK"The overall commute time in the Bay Area is expected to increase about 25 percent from now to 2025. The commute over the bridge to San Francisco from Oakland will slow from an average of 34 minutes now to 55 minutes in 2025, according to a study by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission," Stanley said.LiNeBrEaKMarilyn Sandifur rode the ferry from Larkspur to a San Francisco job in the 1990s.LiNeBrEaK"It was very refreshing," Sandifur said. "You always could find a seat. I remember a jazz band playing on board Friday nights."LiNeBrEaKRiding the ferry during the Christmas holiday season was her favorite. "You would see those Christmas lights on the shoreline on a crisp winter night. Nothing could beat that."LiNeBrEaKStaff writer Lisa White contributed to this story.

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	Discovery Kingdom explores walruses' secret mating habits  	NEWS  	681 words  	Wild rides and wildlife shows are not all Vallejo's Six Flags Discovery Kingdom is about - there's a quiet scientific side behind the scenes, as well.LiNeBrEaKAnd that side is suddenly gaining new traction as the park's scientists work to help preserve the walrus, said spokeswoman Nancy Chan.LiNeBrEaKHolley Muraco, the park's marine mammal reproductive specialist, is working to study the breeding habits of walruses - something difficult to do in the wild. LiNeBrEaKThe efforts come at a time when the walrus' status in the ecological scheme of things is in question. The Center for Biological Diversity reportedly sued the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne last month for failing to act on a petition seeking protection for walruses under the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaKAlaskan walruses are threatened by global warming that melts the Arctic sea ice they use, and also by oil and gas development, according to the group.LiNeBrEaK"Polar bears are always the poster child for global warming, but what about the walruses?" Chan said.LiNeBrEaKBecause of the unique opportunity offered by the park, the breeding habits of Discovery Kingdom's 2,200 pound Pacific walrus Sivuqaq (the ancient Yupik name for the village of Gambell, Alaska) and his two female companions Uquq (blubber) and Sika (ice) have become the subject of some intense study. In fact, Muraco is creating an artificial vagina in the hope of interesting Sivuqaq in performing sexual acts that can be analyzed and quantified, she said.LiNeBrEaKIf everything goes according to plan, the male, nicknamed Jocko for his starring role in the Adam Sandler / Drew Barrymore film "50 First Dates," would by this means provide scientists their first walrus semen sample, Muraco said.LiNeBrEaKThough she's constructed similar body parts for horses, cows and pigs, those creatures' breeding habits are much less of a mystery. Pacific walruses, on the other hand, live in a remote part of the world and breeding activity takes place under water, making observation and study nearly impossible in the wild, Muraco said.LiNeBrEaKThe Discovery Kingdom walruses, whose mothers were killed during a hunt, came to the park from the Bering Sea as 2-week-old unrelated orphans about 14 years ago, Muraco said. They were hand-raised and trained by park experts, which is one reason it's even possible to do the various tests and examinations being performed, she said.LiNeBrEaKAny semen collected will act as a baseline for further study and can be frozen in the park's on-site sperm bank as a sort of insurance policy against the extinction of the species, Muraco said."We don't know what the future is going to be for these arctic species, so this is important," she said.LiNeBrEaK"There are about 30 walruses spread out among only seven facilities in the country, and if this works, we'll share information and techniques so we can add more data to compare," said Discovery Kingdom's animal care director, and Muraco's husband, Mike Muraco.LiNeBrEaK"We are ground zero here with regard to walrus breeding," Holley Muraco said. "It's a big, open area of study as it is with many exotic species."LiNeBrEaKOne reason the Muracos and other park animal experts started brainstorming walrus research ideas about a year ago, is the fact that though the walruses are sexually active, they have yet to produce offspring. This may be because of the animals' youth, but that's one answer the scientists seek.LiNeBrEaKWalruses like Jocko can grow to 4,000 pounds and typically live up to about 30 years, Mike Muraco said.LiNeBrEaKAs the walrus research goes forward, Holley Muraco will monitor the animals' hormones, use ultrasound, take blood tests and vaginal swabs to determine the females winter breeding cycle season, and watch them mate under water, in addition to making the latex or rubber artificial vagina into which semen can be collected. The trio are uncomplaining participants in the examinations and testing, she said.LiNeBrEaK"They're not shy with their sexuality," Holley Muraco said. "They're trained to cooperate with these exams. They just lay back and relax."LiNeBrEaK  E-mail Rachel Raskin-Zrihen at RachelZ@thnewsnet.com or call 707-553-6824.

Planning has not begun on three other proposed ferry routes   from Redwood City to San Francisco and the East Bay; from Hercules to San Francisco; and from San Francisco to Treasure Island.LiNeBrEaKAntioch and Martinez leaders view ferry service as a way to reinvigorate their cities' long-struggling downtowns, located near ferry terminal sites used before bridges were built.LiNeBrEaKMartinez Mayor Rob Schroder said a ferryboat terminal would go hand in hand with efforts to attract retail business to the downtown.LiNeBrEaKA ferry linked Martinez and Benicia from 1847 until 1962, when the Benicia Bridge opened. Since the 1990s, the city several times considered a ferry service, but the plans always fell through.LiNeBrEaKSchroder said he believes Martinez has two advantages this time   as the county seat, the city could play a key role in recovery from a natural disaster or terrorist attack; and a ferry terminal may stimulate economic development in the city's ailing downtown.LiNeBrEaK"I truly believe that it's going to happen this time," he said.LiNeBrEaKObstacles aheadLiNeBrEaKBut Schroder acknowledged challenges to resurrecting ferry service in Martinez, including the considerable distance from the planned parking lot to the ferry terminal site and the terminal's distance from Highway 4.LiNeBrEaKRidership can be a challenge, too.LiNeBrEaKRichmond had a ferry service to San Francisco run by the Red and White Fleet from September 1999 until November 2000, when it was discontinued for lack of passengers. The service averaged 45 riders a day when it needed 200 to be financially viable.LiNeBrEaKSpeed may have been a factor, Stanley said. The ferry was no speedboat at about 11 knots; it took about 45 minutes to reach San Francisco. The new agency's ferry clocks 25 knots and would take an estimated 30 minutes.LiNeBrEaKSome say that faster boats and public subsidies do not guarantee ridership will ever gain critical mass.LiNeBrEaK"I can see (the ferries being) an adjunct system, but I don't see the lavish spending they're talking about," said Cheasty, of Citizens for East Shore Parks. "One of the worst things they could do is spend a lot of money on a ferry system and not get the ridership and then have to close down."LiNeBrEaKIn other words: What if taxpayers spend $400 million on a ferry system and nobody rides?LiNeBrEaKStanley is confident the system can attract riders. The key, he said, is making it competitive with motor vehicles and BART, with travel time, comfort and cost considered.LiNeBrEaK"The overall commute time in the Bay Area is expected to increase about 25 percent from now to 2025. The commute over the bridge to San Francisco from Oakland will slow from an average of 34 minutes now to 55 minutes in 2025, according to a study by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission," Stanley said.LiNeBrEaKMarilyn Sandifur rode the ferry from Larkspur to a San Francisco job in the 1990s.LiNeBrEaK"It was very refreshing," Sandifur said. "You always could find a seat. I remember a jazz band playing on board Friday nights."LiNeBrEaKRiding the ferry during the Christmas holiday season was her favorite. "You would see those Christmas lights on the shoreline on a crisp winter night. Nothing could beat that."LiNeBrEaKStaff writer Lisa White contributed to this story.

The Edmond Sun (Oklahoma)  	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	Locals advise Obama on environment  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	648 words  	Jan. 3--EDMOND -- Global warming, alternative fuel, waste disposal -- when it comes to the environment, president-elect Barack Obama faces some pretty daunting challenges.LiNeBrEaKDuring the campaign, Obama said he wants to create millions of new "green" jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions -- thought to contribute to global warming -- 80 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaKHe wants to reduce America's "carbon footprint" by ensuring that 10 percent of U.S. electricity comes from renewable sources by 2025. He wants to increase energy efficiency, weatherize one million homes annually, develop and deploy clean coal technology and make construction of an Alaska natural gas pipeline a priority. LiNeBrEaKObama also hopes to make the U.S. a leader on climate change.LiNeBrEaKGreenhouse effectLiNeBrEaKMost scientists now believe carbon dioxide and other air pollution are collecting in the atmosphere, acting like a thickening blanket that is trapping the sun's heat, causing the planet to warm up.LiNeBrEaKThe pro-environment Natural Resources Defense Council reports that global warming is causing damage in many parts of the United States through droughts and a greater number of wildfires.LiNeBrEaKKim Anderson, a professor in Oklahoma State University's Department of Agricultural Economics, said he would advise Obama to rethink his thoughts about global warming. Anderson said some evidence shows the earth has warmed while other evidence suggests we are entering a cold cycle.LiNeBrEaK"Is global warming manmade? I think it's preposterous to think that man has that much impact on the environment," said Anderson, doing some work in downtown Edmond at Java Dave's. "What makes anybody think that man can change nature?"LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, in some ways, on a smaller scale, man does influence nature, Anderson said.LiNeBrEaKEdmond resident Susan Kinney said Obama should surround himself with a well-rounded team of advisers, and the president-elect appears to be doing just that.LiNeBrEaKSteven Chu, a pro-alternative fuels Nobel Prize-winning physicist, is Obama's nominee to lead the Energy Department. Harvard's John Holdren will be his science adviser. And green jobs supporter Hilda Solis is his choice to lead the Labor Department.LiNeBrEaKKinney said in addition to continuing his own education on the environment, Obama needs to do more to educate Americans.LiNeBrEaK"We need to be good stewards of our land, and he needs to educate people that they are responsible for what they do to the environment," Kinney said.LiNeBrEaKCheri Blackwood teaches chemistry and physics at Santa Fe High School. Some of Blackwood's units include information on greenhouse emissions, the contents of greenhouse gases and acid rain.LiNeBrEaKBlackwood said she would talk to Obama about the need for alternative fuel sources. Using alternative sources would help reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and create "green" jobs, she said.LiNeBrEaK"My fear is with gas prices dropping the drive to pursue that is not as viable as it was when gas prices were $4 a gallon," Blackwood said.LiNeBrEaKIn June, motorist group AAA's daily survey of gas prices topped $4 for the first time. At the time, crude oil was at $138 a barrel. Prices had risen 31 out of the previous 33 days, establishing records on 29 of those days.LiNeBrEaKOn Friday, the average price for a gallon of unleaded gas in Oklahoma was $1. 49. The highest in-state price was $3. 95, reached on July 16.LiNeBrEaKKinney and Anderson agreed that the country needs to pursue alternative fuel sources. Kinney said many options exist. Anderson said the nation needs to be less dependent on foreign oil.

The Free Lance-Star (Fredericksburg, Virginia)  	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	Giving green light to green incentives NEW AND EXTENDED TAX INCENTIVES: New tax credits may spur some to make their homes more energy efficient, but cost is still a factor.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	871 words  	Jan. 3--Owner Bill Mock says many of the items he carries at Old Towne Window and Door in Fredericksburg are twice as energy-efficient as they were in 2006.LiNeBrEaKThat's when the federal government first offered tax credits for buying such energy-saving products as new heating systems, hybrid cars and windows and doors that meet the International Energy Conservation Code's regional requirements.LiNeBrEaKMock said he already has several customers who waited until this month to make purchases because the tax incentives for buying energy-efficient windows and doors, which expired at the end of 2007, have been reinstated, along with those for other energy-efficient items such as solar panels, as part of the finance industry's bailout package. LiNeBrEaK"I'm sure it will boost business," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe incentives, which take the form of credits on federal income taxes, originally were supposed to be available for five years, but Congress enacted legislation for only two for most items, said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. The Washington-based nonprofit research group helped develop the original 2006-07 tax incentives and pushed for the extensions.LiNeBrEaK"We're really trying to move the market, not just reward good behavior," he said. "We need manufacturers to build [energy-efficient products] and consumers to buy them in significant numbers if we're going to address energy security and global warming."LiNeBrEaKWhile data about the impact of the first round of credits is limited, it is known that more than 20,000 new houses qualified for the energy-efficient-home tax credit in 2007, and heating and cooling manufacturers have come out with more qualifying models, according to Nadel.LiNeBrEaKThe revived homeowner tax credits, which are part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, include extensions of a variety of renewable energy tax incentives that expired at the end of 2007, and add some for such things as small wind turbines and plug-in hybrid vehicles. A detailed list is available at energystar.gov.LiNeBrEaKAmong the extensions are tax credits for such things as efficient furnaces, boilers, air conditioners, water heaters and insulation and window upgrades to existing homes installed in 2009.LiNeBrEaKSteve Coleman, owner of Coleman Heating and Air in Fredericksburg, said the tax credits could help his business, but only after the housing market stabilizes.LiNeBrEaK"People are still holding tight to their money," he said. "If they would hold home mortgages down to 4. 5 percent, especially for first-time home buyers, it would make it possible for people to spend money on other things."LiNeBrEaKNew this year is a tax rebate for small wind turbines that generate 100 kilowatts or less of renewable energy for residential or commercial applications. The credit, which is capped at $4,000, applies to wind turbines placed in service from 2008 through 2016.LiNeBrEaKRoger Cavendish of Caroline County, who became a turbine dealer for Southwest Wind Energy in Flagstaff, Ariz., four months ago, said he's had 50 to 60 people call about buying a wind turbine but has sold only four.LiNeBrEaK"People want one, but they don't have the $10,000 it takes to buy one," he said.LiNeBrEaKCavendish thinks the credit will have an impact, especially since it will reduce the time it takes for a turbine to pay for itself. He has two clients in Winchester lined up to buy this year.LiNeBrEaK"It's gonna help," he said.LiNeBrEaKCavendish added that the Spotsylvania County school system is getting ready to install a turbine at the Spotsylvania Career and Technical Center, and a North Carolina developer wants to put one in each house he plans to build in the Nags Head area.LiNeBrEaK"He wants to do it for the selling point of the house," he said. "Down in Nags Head, they have plenty of wind 24 hours a day."LiNeBrEaKThe Emergency Economic Stabilization Act also includes a new tax credit for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, starting at $2,500 and capped at $7,500 for cars and trucks (the credit is based on the capacity of the battery system). The first 250,000 vehicles sold get the full tax credit, then it phases out like the existing tax credit for buying or leasing a new hybrid gas-electric or diesel automobile.LiNeBrEaKDavid Eaddie, manager of Purvis Ford at Four-Mile Fork, said he doubts that a tax credit will persuade many Fredericksburg-area residents to buy such hybrids as the Ford Escape and Mercury Mariner.LiNeBrEaK"Right now, people aren't thinking tax credits, They're thinking about keeping their houses and better fuel economy," he said. "Hybrids are meant for low-speed driving. We're a commuting neighborhood. "LiNeBrEaKIn the past three years, Eaddie said he's had only a half-dozen customers who were interested in buying a hybrid because of a tax credit.LiNeBrEaK"Hopefully, we'll see more interest on that end with the new Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan."

The Houston Chronicle (Texas)  	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	Dynegy pulls out of coal deal  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	752 words  	Jan. 3--Stingy credit markets and high regulatory hurdles have spurred Houston-based Dynegy to step back from new coal-fired power plant projects by ending a joint venture with LS Power Associates.LiNeBrEaKDynegy will keep the right to expand its 27 existing coal, natural gas and oil-fired plants in 13 states, and it retains stakes in a pair of Texas and Arkansas coal projects.LiNeBrEaKBut Dynegy will pay New York-based LS Power $19 million as part of the split and let it take full ownership of new projects under consideration in Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan and Nevada. LiNeBrEaKShares of Dynegy closed up 38 cents, or 19 percent, to $2. 38 on Friday.LiNeBrEaKDynegy Chairman and CEO Bruce Williamson said the power plant development landscape has changed since the company entered into the joint venture with LS in the fall of 2006. Funding new projects is much more difficult given the worldwide credit crunch and the possibility of new climate change legislation under the Obama administration.LiNeBrEaK"In light of these market circumstances, Dynegy has elected to focus development activities and investments around our own portfolio where we control the option to develop and can manage the costs being incurred more closely," Williamson said in a statement.LiNeBrEaKThe Sierra Club, which has been targeting Dynegy's plans to build coal power plants since 2007, called the announcement a victory.LiNeBrEaK"It seems like the company has recognized our efforts to move to a clean energy future. We applaud them for taking this major step forward," said Bruce Nilles, director of the Sierra Club's National Coal Campaign.LiNeBrEaKNilles said he didn't believe LS Power's remaining coal projects were likely to continue because the firm has "no experience developing or operating coal plants."LiNeBrEaKLS officials couldn't be reached on Friday.LiNeBrEaKDynegy entered into the LS joint venture in 2006 as part of a $2. 2&acirc;[#x20ac][0/00]billion deal that expanded Dynegy's power plant fleet by nearly 60 percent and gave it a foothold into a number of new projects LS had under development.LiNeBrEaKAs many as 150 new coal plant projects were on the books around the country in the early part of the decade, but in the last few years many have been canceled because of cost concerns, permitting difficulties and environmentalist opposition.LiNeBrEaKEarly last year, Dynegy and LS Power withdrew their application with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to build the 600-megawatt High Plains Energy Station. NRG Energy said it was abandoning plans for a 700-megawatt expansion of the Big Cajun plant Louisiana, and PNM Resources canceled plans for a 305-megawatt expansion of a plant in Robertson County, Texas.LiNeBrEaKIn the last few months, as banks slowed down lending in the face of worldwide credit market concerns, the outlook has only gotten worse, said Paul Patterson, an analyst with Glenrock Associates in New York.LiNeBrEaK"The overall credit markets, combined with the dismal economic outlook and the uncertainty surrounding climate change legislation, is causing apprehension with respect to new coal power plants," Patterson said.LiNeBrEaKAmong the cancellations were several plans for a new generation of plant that would use significantly cleaner methods of burning coal and capturing emissions. Several plans for integrated gasification combined-cycle plants, known by the acronym IGCC, were either delayed or canceled, including the widely touted and federally backed FutureGen project.LiNeBrEaKDynegy is still evaluating its partial stake in a 665-megawatt expansion of the Plum Point plant in Arkansas and the new 900-megawatt plant near Riesel in Central Texas. Construction for both projects is under way.LiNeBrEaKDynegy has sold portions of its stakes in the two projects over the past year as a way to cash in on the value of the pending developments, said spokesman David Byford, so it may consider selling the remaining portions as well.LiNeBrEaKAfter the joint venture is dissolved, LS will still own about 40 percent of Dynegy's stock.LiNeBrEaKDynegy had about $1. 9 billion in liquidity available as of early December, a large undrawn bank credit facility and no significant debt maturities until 2011.LiNeBrEaKtom.fowler@chron.com	FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (92%); POWER and COMMUNICATION SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION (90%); POWER PLANTS (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (90%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (90%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); COAL INDUSTRY (89%); COAL MINING (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (88%); CONSTRUCTION (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (77%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (77%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (73%); CREDIT CRISIS (73%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (72%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (69%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (58%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (50%)  	BARACK OBAMA (55%); BRUCE A WILLIAMSON (70%)  	HOUSTON, TX, USA (90%) TEXAS, USA (93%); ARKANSAS, USA (93%); NEW YORK, USA (90%); COLORADO, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 5, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Houston Chronicle   	Tom Fowler, Houston Chronicle  	SIERRA CLUB (55%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	NAICS221210 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION (92%); NAICS221122 ELECTRIC POWER DISTRIBUTION (92%); NAICS211112 NATURAL GAS LIQUID EXTRACTION (92%); SIC1321 NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (92%); SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES (92%) Construction  	20090103-HO-Dynegy-pulls-out-of-coal-deal-0103  	HO  	DYN (NYSE) (92%); PNM (NYSE) (50%) NYSE:DYN, NYSE:NRG, NYSE:PNM  	DYNEGY INC (92%); ACTION ENERGY INC (58%); PNM RESOURCES INC (50%)

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada)  	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	Houston company pulls out of coal-powered plant project  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	774 words  	Jan. 3--A key backer for one of three coal-fired power projects in Nevada announced Friday that it was ending its participation in the project.LiNeBrEaKDynegy Inc. of Houston said that it and LS Power Associates of East Brunswick, N.J., are dissolving their development joint venture for the Nevada generation plant and other new projects.LiNeBrEaKThe joint venture was developing the 1,600-megawatt White Pine Energy Station near Ely and the Southwest Intertie Project, a transmission line that could provide the first direct connection between electric utilities in Southern Nevada and Northern Nevada. LiNeBrEaKLS Power will acquire full ownership and development rights for the White Pine project, the transmission line and new developments in four other states as a result of the dissolution.LiNeBrEaKThe New Jersey company will continue work on the transmission and power plant projects in Nevada, Mark Milburn, LS Power's project development director, said.LiNeBrEaK"We're 100 percent committed to all of our Nevada projects," Milburn said. "Nothing changes on the ground."LiNeBrEaK"It just kind of allows us to do what we do best," which is develop new power plants and transmission lines, he said. Dynegy is more focused on operating plants it owns, rather than on developing new ones, he said.LiNeBrEaKLS Power, a private company, owns 40 percent of the outstanding shares of publicly held Dynegy.LiNeBrEaKThe two companies formed the joint venture two years ago to build coal and gas-fired power plants.

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	Houston company pulls out of coal-powered plant project  	D; Pg. 1D  	720 words  	LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNALLiNeBrEaKA key backer for one of three coal-fired power projects in Nevada announced Friday that it was ending its participation in the project.LiNeBrEaKDynegy Inc. of Houston said that it and LS Power Associates of East Brunswick, N.J., are dissolving their development joint venture for the Nevada generation plant and other new projects.LiNeBrEaKThe joint venture was developing the 1,600-megawatt White Pine Energy Station near Ely and the Southwest Intertie Project, a transmission line that could provide the first direct connection between electric utilities in Southern Nevada and Northern Nevada. LiNeBrEaKLS Power will acquire full ownership and development rights for the White Pine project, the transmission line and new developments in four other states as a result of the dissolution.LiNeBrEaKThe New Jersey company will continue work on the transmission and power plant projects in Nevada, Mark Milburn, LS Power's project development director, said.LiNeBrEaK"We're 100 percent committed to all of our Nevada projects," Milburn said. "Nothing changes on the ground."LiNeBrEaK"It just kind of allows us to do what we do best," which is develop new power plants and transmission lines, he said. Dynegy is more focused on operating plants it owns, rather than on developing new ones, he said.LiNeBrEaKLS Power, a private company, owns 40 percent of the outstanding shares of publicly held Dynegy.LiNeBrEaKThe two companies formed the joint venture two years ago to build coal and gas-fired power plants. Since then, environmentalists have urged regulators to stop the coal-fired power projects, saying the plants would throw off large quantities of carbon dioxide that leads to global warming.LiNeBrEaKIn explaining its exit, Dynegy also referred to the need to obtain financing for the projects.

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Wisconsin) 	January 3, 2009 Saturday   Final Edition	Electric utility plans change in rates to foster efficiency &lt;|&gt; WPS will uncouple profits, energy sales  	B Business; Pg. 6  	774 words  	In a move expected to be followed by at least one other state utility, Wisconsin Public Service Corp. of Green Bay will no longer see profits dip when sales of electricity slide.LiNeBrEaK That may seem like a profit plan many businesses wish they could use during slowing economic times, but it's all part of a growing movement around the country to help customers save on rising home energy costs.LiNeBrEaK The northeastern Wisconsin utility won state approval this week for a plan that would break the link between profits and electricity sales. It also would boost spending to encourage customers to reduce their use of energy. LiNeBrEaK "It should be a very good thing for the environment and for energy conservation because it allows us to take our focus off the bottom line and put it into education and helping our customers use less energy," utility spokesman Kerry Spees said.LiNeBrEaK The change is in line with a growing movement gaining ground across the country. Long advocated by environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, "decoupling" energy sales from utility earnings is being implemented or considered in several states.LiNeBrEaK Environmentalists like it because it boosts spending on energy efficiency, an area on which utilities placed a much lower priority than on building power plants. But utilities are warming to the idea as a battered economy has led to projections of lower electricity sales.LiNeBrEaK The measure is similar to recommendations announced almost a year ago by the state's global warming task force. Boosting spending on energy conservation is designed to encourage consumers to take steps to bring down their energy use and monthly bills at a time when prices could rise to comply with global warming mandates.LiNeBrEaK "It's a very positive first step," said Steve Heins, an energy-efficiency advocate who has given talks on decoupling at national energy conferences on behalf of Wisconsin-based Orion Energy Systems Inc. "What you'll see is this blueprint will probably be the model for Wisconsin."LiNeBrEaKSome oppose itLiNeBrEaK But the move is opposed by some utility customers, who have seen rates increase steadily in recent years to pay for new power plants, transmission lines and rising fuel costs.LiNeBrEaK The Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group, which represents manufacturers and other big energy users, opposes the change. It argues that utilities already spend millions of dollars on energy-efficiency programs.LiNeBrEaK The WPS pilot project, however, only affects residential customers and small businesses.LiNeBrEaK The fixed charge that appears on its residential customers' monthly bills is dropping in 2009, while WPS is boosting spending on energy efficiency by allocating more money for the state Focus on Energy program.LiNeBrEaK WPS will develop pilot projects in several communities designed to boost energy efficiency. The exact nature of the community-based pilots won't be developed for several months, Spees said.LiNeBrEaK Those pilots could serve as models for other initiatives around the state, said Charlie Higley, executive director of the Wisconsin Citizens' Utility Board.LiNeBrEaK "These community pilots will test other ways of marketing energy efficiency so more consumers can participate and enjoy the savings, and then those can be replicated with other utilities," Higley said.LiNeBrEaK The Citizens' Utility Board has been in contact with other state utilities, including We Energies of Milwaukee, to explore similar moves. To date, only Madison-based Wisconsin Power and Light Co. has expressed interest.LiNeBrEaKRate optionsLiNeBrEaK State regulators are weighing a variety of proposals that would boost spending on energy efficiency as well as change the way customers' rates are structured so as to reward energy conservation.LiNeBrEaK Energy rates could be modeled on water rates that have been adopted for customers in Waukesha and Madison. Those rates encourage conservation by charging customers much higher rates if they use more than a certain amount of water.LiNeBrEaK By itself, decoupling isn't good for consumers, Higley said. "That's why we asked WPS to consider this package of rate reductions and more energy efficiency spending," he said.LiNeBrEaK Under an agreement with the Citizens' Utility Board, WPS agreed to boost the funding for Focus on Energy so that a higher percentage of its sales will be spent on efficiency programs than other utilities in the state.LiNeBrEaK Currently, 1. 2% of the utility's sales is sent to the Focus on Energy program, but that will ramp up, on a path toward tripling current funding levels by 2015.

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Wisconsin) 	January 3, 2009 Saturday   Final Edition	YOUR OPINIONS  	A News; Pg. 9  	845 words  	COWSLiNeBrEaKThe power of the pieLiNeBrEaK With all the bad news lately, it was fun to read Mike Nichols' Dec. 27 column "Cows raising a stink: Our alternative energy future," which, in a light tone, proposes several solutions to serious problems we are facing on the tired old Earth.LiNeBrEaK Recently, I read about places in Wisconsin where tap water runs brown. Yuck! Why not - as Nichols suggests - take manure and turn it into "Black Gold, Texas T." Two problems solved. Coal companies might stop chopping up beautiful mountains and dumping dust and heavy metals into streams. Problem three solved. LiNeBrEaK And as for cost - I disagree that this would cost more. We need to factor in the cost of wars being fought so Chevron and Mobil can make a profit selling us that oil. We could stop paying Blackwater and Halliburton and all the other war profiteers if we had home-grown oil. Imagine how much cheaper that would be. And we might just create some jobs in the bargain!LiNeBrEaK Carolyn VargoLiNeBrEaK MilwaukeeLiNeBrEaKNot quite so easyLiNeBrEaK Regarding Mike Nichols' Dec. 27 column "Cows raising a stink: Our alternative energy future": The senate staffer's statement that Wisconsin could generate more electricity from manure than from wind power is not supported by the numbers.LiNeBrEaK To make biogas from manure, a dairy farm operator has to keep the cows inside and under a roof at all times. Only in a confined setting is it possible to collect cow manure and break it down in an oxygen-free digester that results in methane. Of Wisconsin's 1. 3 million dairy cows, only one-eighth live in confined animal operations. The average dairy cow here is part of a small herd and spends a considerable amount of time in pasture.LiNeBrEaK As stated in the column, Wisconsin is well ahead of other states in capturing energy from dairy cow manure and generating electricity with it, and there is certainly room for growth. Bear in mind, however, that it takes more than 2,000 dairy cows to produce enough methane to equal the output from one commercial wind turbine. Yes, Wisconsin now boasts about two dozen biogas generation systems attached to dairy farms. But compared with the output from the 251 wind turbines installed this year at four projects, their electrical production is quite modest.LiNeBrEaK Though other locally available resources - solar, small hydro, woody fuels and biomethane - certainly will play a larger part in contributing to Wisconsin's electricity mix, wind energy will remain the renewable energy workhorse for the foreseeable future.LiNeBrEaK The Governor's Task Force on Global Warming recommended a raft of policies to achieve a renewable energy goal of 25% by 2025, no small undertaking. If we're serious about achieving that goal, we must accept contributions from all eligible resources. We do not have the luxury of playing favorites.LiNeBrEaK Michael VickermanLiNeBrEaK Executive director,LiNeBrEaK  RENEW WisconsinLiNeBrEaK MadisonLiNeBrEaKHEALTH CARELiNeBrEaKState's ERs need helpLiNeBrEaK Wisconsin's emergency departments are near the breaking point, as demonstrated in the 2009 state report card recently issued by the American College of Emergency Physicians. Overall, Wisconsin received a C. However, we scored only a C- in the Access to Emergency Care category, a reflection of our state's woefully inadequate Medicaid rates for emergency medical care.LiNeBrEaK Skyrocketing costs of health insurance and increasing unemployment rates have forced more people to be uninsured. These individuals now seek even routine medical care in our emergency departments, resulting in overcrowding and ambulance diversions.LiNeBrEaK  Hospitals in our own backyard have closed due to the rising tide of Medicaid and uninsured patients who can ill afford the costs of their own health care. At a time when the role of emergency care has never been more essential, Wisconsin's emergency departments are in critical condition.LiNeBrEaK Wisconsinites expect emergency services to be available in their hour of need. As a practicing emergency physician, I know firsthand how critical it is for Wisconsin's emergency departments to remain financially sound. State funds must be allocated to bolster emergency departments, which are as vital to our community as police and fire services.LiNeBrEaK Howard Croft, MDLiNeBrEaK Vice president, Wisconsin ACEPLiNeBrEaK MequonLiNeBrEaKCHARLENE HARDINLiNeBrEaKActions are arrogantLiNeBrEaK I am sick of the Charlene Hardin saga. She used taxpayer funds to attend a conference. Since she didn't attend the conference, that was misuse of taxpayer funds and unethical. I don't recall an explanation for why she didn't attend the conference, nor did she take responsibility for her actions. Since she apparently cannot validate her actions, she inappropriately resorted to playing the "race card." What arrogance!LiNeBrEaK If Hardin worked in the private sector and misused company funds this way, she would have been fired in August. If the district attorney found her actions "incompetent," then I question her competence as a School Board member.LiNeBrEaK Constance JanikowskiLiNeBrEaK Milwaukee	AGRICULTURAL WASTES (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); DAIRY FARMING (89%); METHANE (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); SOLAR ENERGY (89%); WIND POWER PLANTS (89%); WIND ENERGY (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (78%); HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (77%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (75%); BIOFUELS (70%); COAL INDUSTRY (70%); HEAVY METALS and TOXIC MINERALS (70%); GOVERNORS (62%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  	MIKE NICHOLS (93%)  	MILWAUKEE, WI, USA (91%) WISCONSIN, USA (98%) UNITED STATES (98%)  	January 12, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Journal Sentinel Inc.   																						
The New York Times 	January 3, 2009 Saturday   Late Edition - Final	The Man Who Discovered Oxygen (Maybe) and Gave the World Soda Water  LiNeBrEaKInvention of Air, The (Book)&gt;  	Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Pg. 3  	1005 words  	THE INVENTION OF AIR LiNeBrEaK  A Story of Science, Faith, Revolution, and the Birth of America LiNeBrEaK  By Steven Johnson LiNeBrEaK  Illustrated. 254 pages. Riverhead Books. $25. 95. LiNeBrEaK  Steven Johnson likes to connect things. In ''The Invention of Air,''  his account  of Joseph Priestley, he describes how this great 18th-century scientist and philosopher -- along with other giants of the Enlightenment like Jefferson and Franklin -- possessed a ''connective sensibility,''  enabling him to master many fields at once. Mr. Johnson laments the intellectual specialization of our modern age. It's a legitimate complaint, but his own attempt to leap different disciplines in a single bound is less enlightening than annoying. It seems forced, even frivolous, a kind of book-length game of Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon in which everything that ever was and ever will be is linked to everything else.LiNeBrEaK  Oxygen molecules were a key subject of Priestley's researches. They are connected to photosynthesis, Mr. Johnson points out, which is connected to England's coal deposits, which are connected to the rise of industrialization, which is connected to the French and American Revolutions, which are connected to present-day global warming.  LiNeBrEaK  An incredibly productive eight-year period in the 1760s and 1770s  --  when Priestley made groundbreaking discoveries in chemistry; expanded our understanding of electricity; wrote more than 50 books and pamphlets on politics, education and religion, including a three-volume study of Christianity; and invented soda water  --  leads Mr. Johnson to speculate about ''hot hands.''  It's as if the link he sees between Priestley's achievements and Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak is something more than a figment of an overintellectualized imagination. LiNeBrEaK  Elsewhere, a chapter titled  ''Intermezzo'' interrupts the portrait of the 18th century for a description of France as it was 300 million years ago. Mr. Johnson, who has written books on science and popular culture, speaks of taking a  ''long zoom approach,''  but too often one is left feeling that we are looking at Priestley through the wrong end of a telescope.LiNeBrEaK  The book is most successful when Mr. Johnson simply gives us the straight biographical facts. Priestley is a great subject for any writer  --  truly an extraordinary and inspiring individual. Mr. Johnson says that today he is  ''barely more than a footnote'' in history. He deserves better, and if  ''The Invention of Air''  revives interest in him, then its author will have performed a genuine service.LiNeBrEaK  It's always a relief when Mr. Johnson puts his grand speculations aside and focuses on Priestley, who is such good company. His contemporaries thought so too. He was brilliant, of course  --  fluent in six languages, the author of almost 500 books and pamphlets  --  but also open, generous, good-humored and unfailingly curious and creative. He is widely credited with discovering oxygen (though there is some dispute about this) through a series of painstaking experiments in a homemade laboratory. He invented soda water at least in part because he happened to live next to a brewery and was intrigued by the process of fermentation. It was, he said, his  ''happiest''  discovery, even if the person who patented a method of carbonating water several years later was a fellow named Johann Schweppes.LiNeBrEaK  Like his soda bubbles, Priestley rose to the top of any society he was a member of. Born near Leeds in 1733, he spent the early part of his career as a dissenting minister and theologian, eventually helping to found Unitarianism; his ideas challenging the divinity of Christ had an enormous influence on Thomas Jefferson. LiNeBrEaK  Arriving in London from the provinces in 1765, he quickly joined a group of freethinking intellectuals known as the Honest Whigs, which included James Boswell and Benjamin Franklin. (Priestley's history of electricity established the popular image of Franklin flying a kite during an electrical storm.) When he relocated to Birmingham some years later he joined another remarkable circle, the Lunar Society, with members like James Watt, Josiah Wedgwood and Erasmus Darwin, Charles's grandfather; they called themselves the Lunaticks. LiNeBrEaK  During his Birmingham period Priestley devoted most of his energies to religion and politics. His unorthodox beliefs, along with his  enthusiastic support for the French Revolution, turned him into a very public target for nationalist zealots. Conservatives like Samuel Johnson called him  ''an evil man,'' and despite his many accomplishments he was refused an audience with King George III. LiNeBrEaK  Priestley, Steven Johnson says, had made himself  ''the most hated man in all of Britain.''  In 1791 a mob burned down his house and, more tragically, his laboratory. Soon he and his family were off to that new, more open-minded country, the United States.LiNeBrEaK  In America as in England, Priestley seems to have become acquainted with everyone who was anyone. He had tea on several occasions with George Washington. John Adams urged him to settle in Boston. He was especially close to Jefferson. Mr. Johnson calls him  ''a kind of Zelig of early American history.''  Yet, as in England, his religious and political views got him into trouble. During the repressive time of the Alien and Sedition Acts, it was only the personal intervention of President Adams that kept him out of prison.LiNeBrEaK  Happily, for all the controversy Priestley stirred up wherever he went, his story ends well. He lived long enough to see his friend Jefferson become president, and  -- unusually for so strong-willed, opinionated and divisive a public figure  --  he died contentedly.  ''Tell Mr. Jefferson,'' he wrote to a companion in 1804, a few days before he passed away, but with his usual optimism and hopefulness,  ''that I think myself happy to have lived so long under his excellent administration; and that I have a prospect of dying in it. It is, I am confident, the best on the face of the earth, and yet I hope to rise to some thing more excellent.''

The New York Times 	January 3, 2009 Saturday   Late Edition - Final	In Obama's Team, 2 Camps on Climate  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 10  	1371 words  	In the fall of 1997, when the Clinton administration was forming its position for the Kyoto climate treaty talks, Lawrence H. Summers argued that the United States would risk damaging the domestic economy if it set overly ambitious goals for reducing carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Summers, then the deputy Treasury secretary, said at the time that there was a compelling scientific case for action on global warming but that a too-rapid move against emissions of greenhouse gases risked dire and unknowable economic consequences. LiNeBrEaK  His view prevailed over those of officials arguing for tougher standards, among them Carol M. Browner, then the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and her mentor, Al Gore, then the vice president.LiNeBrEaK  Today, as the climate-change debate once again heats up, Mr. Summers leads the economic team of the incoming  administration, and Ms. Browner has been designated its White House coordinator of energy and climate policy. And Mr. Gore is hovering as an informal adviser to President-elect Barack Obama. LiNeBrEaK  As Mr. Obama seeks to find the right balance between his environmental goals and his plans to revive the economy, he may have to resolve conflicting views among some of his top advisers. LiNeBrEaK  While Mr. Summers's thinking on climate change has evolved over the last decade, his views on the potential risks to the economy of an aggressive effort to limit carbon emissions have not. But he now works for a president-elect who has set ambitious goals for addressing global warming through a government-run cap-and-trade system.LiNeBrEaK  It may once again prove to be Mr. Summers's role to inject a rigorous economist's reality check into the debate over the scope and speed of an attack on global warming. LiNeBrEaK  According to a transition official familiar with Mr. Summers's thinking, he is wary of moving very quickly on a carbon cap, because doing so could raise energy costs, kill jobs and deepen the current recession. He foresees a phase-in of several years for any carbon restraint regime, particularly if the economy continues to be sluggish, a slower timetable than many lawmakers and environmentalists are pressing.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Summers and Peter R. Orszag, the economist whom Mr. Obama has designated director of the White House budget office, have both argued that a tax on carbon emissions from burning gasoline, coal and other fuels might be a more economically efficient means of regulating pollutants than a cap-and-trade system, under which an absolute ceiling on emissions is set and polluters are allowed to buy and sell permits to meet it.LiNeBrEaK  But Mr. Obama and Ms. Browner have ruled out a straight carbon tax, perhaps mindful of the stinging political defeat the Clinton administration suffered in 1993 when, prodded by Mr. Gore, it proposed one. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama was asked in a television interview last month whether he would consider imposing a stiff tax on gasoline, whose price has now fallen to below $2 a gallon after cresting above $4 a gallon last summer.LiNeBrEaK  He replied that while American families were getting some relief at the pump, they were hurting in other ways, through rising unemployment and falling home values. ''So putting additional burdens on American families right now, I think, is a mistake,'' he said. LiNeBrEaK  At least for the present, then, the idea of a carbon tax has been shelved, and Mr. Obama's economic and environmental advisers are working, along with Congress, to devise a cap-and-trade system.LiNeBrEaK  But difficult debates lie ahead within the White House, between the White House and Congress, and within the Democratic Party, whose deep divisions on climate change break down along ideological and geographical lines. LiNeBrEaK  The fight in November between two Democrats, Representatives John D. Dingell of Michigan and Henry A. Waxman of California, for the chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce Committee was a preview. It pitted lawmakers from auto- and coal-producing states against liberal lawmakers from California and the East Coast, Blue Dog fiscal conservatives against environmentalists, pro-business moderates against regulatory activists. Mr. Waxman, with the tacit support of the Obama camp and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, won, but narrowly.LiNeBrEaK  That was just a taste of the broader and potentially more bitter fight over global warming and energy legislation, which will have profound implications for the American economy, the environment and foreign policy.LiNeBrEaK  Both sides -- those seeking strict enforcement of emissions limits and those concerned about higher energy costs and potential job losses -- will find receptive ears in the new White House, Obama aides and outside analysts said.LiNeBrEaK  ''There is a diversity of opinion among Democrats over the best way to contain costs associated with a climate change plan,'' said Scott Segal, a utility lobbyist in Washington, who cited rival approaches pushed by Senator Barbara Boxer of California, chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.LiNeBrEaK  ''I think there is room within the current range of administration advisers to accommodate all those points of view,'' Mr. Segal said. LiNeBrEaK  The Obama transition did not make Ms. Browner or Mr. Summers available for on-the-record interviews. A spokesman, Nick Shapiro, said that Mr. Obama had appointed advisers with differing views but that ultimately he would set policy.LiNeBrEaK  ''At the end of the day,'' Mr. Shapiro said in an e-mail statement, ''the advisers will be charged with implementing President-elect Obama's strong targets that set us on a course to reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020 and reduce them an additional 80 percent by 2050. However, the president-elect appointed a cabinet with diverse views and looks forward to strong debate within the cabinet on how best to achieve those outcomes.'' LiNeBrEaK  Emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by the United States in 2007 were about 15 percent above 1990's level, according to the Department of Energy.LiNeBrEaK  In past public statements and writings, Ms. Browner and Mr. Summers have wrestled with the difficult choices posed by global warming and at times have come to different conclusions on how to minimize the impact on the economy.LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Browner has been a forceful advocate for strict carbon limits for years and has said that a comprehensive cap-and-trade system is the best way to achieve swift and certain reductions in emissions. She has said that the plan could include flexibility for carbon-emitting businesses by allowing them to bank and borrow permits, but she has not supported setting a maximum price or ''safety valve'' cost in case permits become prohibitively expensive, as Mr. Summers and Mr. Orszag have.LiNeBrEaK  She has urged Congress to take up the issue quickly in the new year. In September, in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee, Ms. Browner  pointedly noted that the Supreme Court had given the E.P.A. authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. She implied that if Mr. Obama was elected, the new administration might unilaterally seek to curb carbon emissions should Congress not act.LiNeBrEaK  ''Given the magnitude of the problem, and the scale of the solution required,'' she said, ''I believe it is important that Congress provide national leadership on this issue.''LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Summers believes a cap-and-trade program can be a workable solution, provided it includes some sort of escape clause if prices rise too quickly, according to several articles he has written in the past two years. He has also expressed a belief that developing nations must also adhere to carbon limits, or manufacturing jobs will migrate to countries without them.LiNeBrEaK  In a forum at the Brookings Institution a year ago, Mr. Summers said the current moment on climate change was analogous to that on health care in 1992: Everyone agreed that the current system was unsustainable, but there was less agreement on how to address the complexities and costs. There was a general expectation that with the inauguration of a new Democratic president, something would be done. LiNeBrEaK  ''In the end,'' Mr. Summers said, ''what everyone agreed needed to happen didn't happen in 1993.''

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	Obama s options on global warming  	COMMENTARY; Pg. 2  	941 words  	COPENHAGENLiNeBrEaKIN ONE OF HIS FIRST public policy statements as America s president-elect, Barack Obama focused on climate change, and clearly stated both his priorities and the facts on which these priorities rest. Unfortunately, both are weak, or even wrong.LiNeBrEaKObama s policy outline was presented via video to California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger s Governors  Global Warming Summit, and has again been shown in Poznan, Poland, to leaders assembled to flesh out a global warming roadmap. According to Obama,  Few challenges facing America and the world are more urgent than combating climate change.  LiNeBrEaKSuch a statement is now commonplace for most political leaders around the world, even though it neglects to address the question of how much we can do to help America and the world through climate policies versus other policies.LiNeBrEaKConsider, for example, hurricanes in America. Clearly, a policy of reducing CO{-2} emissions would have had zero consequence on Katrina s devastating impact on New Orleans, where such a disaster was long expected. Over the next half-century, even large reductions in CO{-2} emissions would have only a negligible impact.LiNeBrEaKInstead, direct policies to address New Orleans s vulnerabilities could have avoided the huge and unnecessary cost in human misery and economic loss. These should have included stricter building codes, smarter evacuation policies and better preservation of wetlands (which could have reduced the ferociousness of the hurricane s effects). Most importantly, a greater focus on upkeep and restoration of the levees could have spared the city entirely. Perhaps such preventive actions should be Obama s priority.LiNeBrEaKLikewise, consider world hunger. Pleas for action on climate change reflect fears that global warming might undermine agricultural production, especially in the developing world. But global agricultural/economic models indicate that even under the most pessimistic assumptions, global warming would reduce agricultural production by just 1. 4 percent by the end of the century. Because agricultural output will more than double over this period, climate change would at worst cause global food production to double not in 2080 but in 2081.LiNeBrEaKMoreover, implementing the Kyoto Protocol at a cost of $180 billion annually would keep only two million people from going hungry by the end of the century. Yet by spending just $10 billion annually on direct food aid, the United Nations estimates that we could help 229 million hungry people now. For every amount spent on climate policies to save one person from hunger in a hundred years, the same amount could save 5,000 people now. Arguably, this should be among Obama s top priorities.LiNeBrEaKObama went on to say why he wants to prioritize global-warming policies:  The science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear. Sea levels are rising. Coastlines are shrinking. We ve seen record drought, spreading famine, and storms that are growing stronger with each passing hurricane season. LiNeBrEaKYes, global warming is happening, and mankind is partly responsible, but Obama s statements are   however eloquent   seriously wrong or misleading.LiNeBrEaKSea levels are rising, but they have been rising at least since the early 1800s. In the era of satellite measurements, the rise has not accelerated (actually we ve seen a sea-level fall over the past two years). The U.N. expects about a 30-centimeter sea-level rise over this century   about what we saw over the past 150 years.LiNeBrEaKIn that period, many coastlines increased, most obviously in Holland, because rich countries can easily protect and even expand their territory. But even for oft-cited Bangladesh, scientists just this year showed that the country grows by 20 square kilometers each year, because river sedimentation wins out over rising sea levels.LiNeBrEaKObama s claim about record droughts similarly fails even on a cursory level   the United States has in all academic estimates been getting wetter over the century (the 1930s  dust bowl  set the drought high point). This is even true globally over the past half-century, as one of the most recent scientific studies of actual soil moisture shows:  There is an overall small wetting trend in global soil moisture. LiNeBrEaKFurthermore, famine has rapidly declined over the past half-century. The main deviation has been the past two years of record-high food prices, caused not by climate change but by the policies designed to combat it: the dash for ethanol, which put food into cars and thus upward pressure on food prices. The World Bank estimates that this policy has driven at least 30 million more people into hunger. To cite policy-driven famine as an argument for more of the same policy seems unreasonable, to say the least.LiNeBrEaKFinally, it is simply wrong to say that storms are growing stronger every hurricane season. Even for the Atlantic hurricane basin, which we tend to hear about the most, the total hurricane energy as measured by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has declined by two-thirds since the record was set, in 2005. For the world, this trend has been more decisive: Maximum hurricane energy was reached in 1994, and has plummeted for the past three years, while hurricanes around the world have for the past year been about as inactive as at any time since records were kept.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming should be tackled, but smartly through research and development of low-carbon alternatives. If we are to get our policies right, it is crucial that we get our facts right.LiNeBrEaKBjorn Lomborg is the author of The Skeptical Environmentalist and Cool It, head of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, and adjunct professor at Copenhagen Business School.

The Register Guard (Eugene, Oregon)  	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	County weighs cap-and-trade for emissions  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	778 words  	Jan. 3--The public forest lands in Lane County and across Oregon have long been measured in terms of their value to lumber, recreation and natural habitat.LiNeBrEaKNow the county board is considering a new role for them: Battling global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe commissioners are considering the monetary value of public forests for carbon sequestration, which is the absorption of "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide that cause climate change. The county wants to be positioned to benefit if the federal government -- even years from now -- starts paying communities that take harmful gases out of the air, a county official said this week. LiNeBrEaKThe county is working with state representatives on a statement asking Congress to share any future revenue from carbon sequestration on federal forest lands in the counties, just as revenue from timber sales is shared today, said Alex Cuyler, the county's intergovernmental relations manager.LiNeBrEaKUnder the "cap-and-trade" model, the nation's carbon emissions could be capped at a certain level and entities that produce less greenhouse gases could sell credits to those that produce more.LiNeBrEaKDuring a report to the county board last fall, County Administrator Jeff Spartz said Lane County's public forest land could bring $48 million annually, depending on the value that the federal government could set per ton for carbon reduction. The county's operating budget, by comparison, is about $65 million.LiNeBrEaKBut some question whether policy-&Acirc;--makers can make carbon sequestration work on the ground.LiNeBrEaKMary Wood, an environmental law professor at the University of Oregon, said scientists continue to debate whether the human race has already put in play irreversible, climate-related natural disasters that will eventually overwhelm the planet.LiNeBrEaKBut those scientists who argue society can reverse the catastrophic trend do so with the assumption that governments will protect the forests and soils that store carbon, she added.LiNeBrEaK"The scientists are banking on local and state governments protecting these lands, and government officials need to know that and do it," Wood said.LiNeBrEaKPart of the carbon-sequestration debate, Wood said, revolves around whether policy-&Acirc;--makers can create programs that address specific concerns -- the loss of a carbon-absorbing forest to fire, for example, or the risk that a carbon producer will simply pay more to emit much more carbon.LiNeBrEaKCongress, in fact, is debating the merits of cap-and-trade versus simply taxing carbon producers, Cuyler said.LiNeBrEaKOne proponent of the carbon tax is Eugene resident Tom Bowerman, a former board member with the environmental group 1000 Friends of Oregon.LiNeBrEaKIn a 2006 guest column in The Register-Guard, Bowerman said cap-and-trade is politically feasible but "ripe for political manipulation, backsliding and loopholes."LiNeBrEaKBut the carbon tax is easily computed and administered, Bowerman said, and sends a strong signal to carbon producers while encouraging smart consumer choices. It's been effective in northern Europe, he added.LiNeBrEaKCap-and-trade advocates have support, too, including Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski.LiNeBrEaKKulongoski is seeking legislative approval this year to participate in a regional cap-and-trade program, said Jim Cathcart of the Oregon Department of Forestry.LiNeBrEaKThe program would include "offsets," which entities that sequester gases would sell to regulated carbon producers that want to exceed limits. It would be up to policy-makers to ensure that the offsets are effective, Cathcart said.LiNeBrEaKThose who would preserve forests to store carbon might even find a level of agreement with those who favor converting trees to lumber.LiNeBrEaKThe pro-lumber, Portland-based American Forest Resource Council touts "well-managed forests and the use of lumber products" for carbon sequestration. But forests should be thinned, the council said, to reduce the intensity of wildfires that release excessive amounts of carbon into the air.LiNeBrEaKCuyler said, however, that the county board hasn't established the forests' value for carbon sequestration versus their value for other uses such as harvest.LiNeBrEaK"Those people who would argue for forest management based on carbon sequestration are going to make a different argument than those who would base it on timber management," Cuyler said.

They're everywhere -- Top 10 News Stories of 2008; Milestones; Biggest and Best; Least and Worst; Dumbest Criminals.LiNeBrEaKThe year's Movies; Songs; Books; Storms; Cars; Moments in Sports; Triumphs; Tragedies. The "Year in Review" list goes on ad infinitum.LiNeBrEaKNot to be outdone, 2009 beckons. Challenges, of course, but also Predictions -- and not all of them dire, thankfully. LiNeBrEaKSome "doomsday" predictions you've already heard -- deepening recession, continuing mortgage crisis. But seers and mystics are gazing into their crystal balls and prophesying other events that aren't quite so cataclysmic.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, some are downright heavenly.LiNeBrEaKOur friend, Judy Hevenly, Los Angeles-based psychic, author and international lecturer, has made predictions for 2009 on everything from airlines offering WI-FI to a new film studio in the San Bernardino area to a successor for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.LiNeBrEaK"I meditate and think about the world and then it comes to me," said Judy, who on Feb. 9, predicted Barack Obama would be the next president of the United States.LiNeBrEaKAccording to Judy, featured in the book, "The 100 Top Psychics in America," a large environmental government agency could be coming to the San Bernardino area in 2009.LiNeBrEaKSo here's another list -- some Hevenly things to look for in 2009:LiNeBrEaK--"Assistance from the Obama administration for the housing and bankingLiNeBrEaKsectors; $100billion given to road and bridge work and $15billion a year to green tech investment, school repairs.LiNeBrEaK--"A rising skating champion will become known from the Asian community in San Bernardino.LiNeBrEaK--"An Asian university specializing in health and acupuncture, and training for oriental medicine to help humanity.LiNeBrEaK--"New sightings of UFOs over Big Bear Lake, letting the locals know that they are not alone, that the ETs are close by, watching over them protectively.LiNeBrEaK--"The ghost of Martin Luther King will hover over Presidential-elect Barack Obama on the Inauguration Day ceremony.LiNeBrEaK--"Disneyland Resort in Anaheim will become a panacea for the unemployed to visit during the recession to boost their morale and get a new outlook.LiNeBrEaK--"Lance Armstrong will win the Tour de France in 2009.LiNeBrEaK--"There will be a peace treaty in the Middle East (2009-2010) between Israel and Palestine, with the United States and France playing an important role.LiNeBrEaK--"There will be a mega summit on climate change in Copenhagen in November-December 2009, with the United States, China, Europe -- a post-Kyoto agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK--"Cell phone firms to offer free small laptop with Internet services.LiNeBrEaK--"Baby boy for Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes; baby girl for Victoria Beckham.LiNeBrEaK--"President Barack Obama to receive Nobel Peace Prize.LiNeBrEaK--"Andrew Cuomo could possibly be named to replace Hillary Clinton as New York senator.LiNeBrEaK--"Golden Globe winners, 2009: Best Picture -- Drama, "Slumdog Millionare"; Best Animated Movie, "Wall-E"; Best Picture -- Comedy, "Mama Mia"; Best Actor -- Drama, Brad Pitt; Best Actress -- Drama, Angelina Jolie; Best Supporting Actor, Heath Ledger; Best Supporting Actress, Penelope Cruz."LiNeBrEaKAnd a new trend?

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	Advocacy groups greening Utah: Environmentalism ? Study shows groups are increasing at nearly double the rate of other nonprofits.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	775 words  	Jan. 3--The grass roots sprouting up around Utah are mostly green.LiNeBrEaKNew environmental groups are sprouting up all over -- contrary to a declaration five years ago that the green movement had grown monolithic, fossilized and died.LiNeBrEaKSome of Utah's new groups focus on neighborhoods, such as the San Juan County community concerned about uranium mining planned for their area. LiNeBrEaKOthers organize constituencies, like the Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment and the Utah Moms for Clean Air.LiNeBrEaKAnd still more focus on a particular environmental problem, like Uranium Watch, concentrating on pollution from nuclear energy, or Urgency Utah, campaigning to bring climate-change solutions to the forefront.LiNeBrEaKBrigham Young University political science professor Kelly Patterson says the sprouting of new green groups makes sense on an issue as diverse as the environment. While Utahns might snub a Washington-based organization focused broadly on national environmental policy, they readily welcome neighbors addressing a problem down the block.LiNeBrEaK"It's what you do about uranium tailings," said Patterson, who studies interest groups. "It's what you do about particulate matter [air pollution], it's what you do about preserving open spaces."LiNeBrEaKThe trend isn't unique to Utah. A new study by the Urban Institute shows that green groups are increasing at nearly double the rate of other kinds of nonprofits. Meanwhile, author Paul Hawken describes theLiNeBrEaKphenomenon as part of a global movement in his book Blessed Unrest .LiNeBrEaKFor Cherise Udell, president and founder of Utah Moms for Clean Air, none of this is surprising.LiNeBrEaKExasperated with the apparent apathy about high-pollution periods in the Salt Lake Valley, she recognized "a need and a niche to be filled" when she launched Moms nearly two years ago.LiNeBrEaK"Caring about the environment has become mainstream," says Udell. "It's no longer a fringe issue."LiNeBrEaKThe group now has an e-mail list of around 1,200 and a track record of accomplishments that include reducing motor vehicle idling at schools and a school-bus retrofitting program intended to lessen children's exposure to polluted exhaust. Members, many with a professional background, have been known to petition lawmakers with a baby balanced on their hips, a loaf of banana bread in one hand and legal documents in the other.LiNeBrEaK"We really brought the air issue to the kitchen table," says Udell.LiNeBrEaKAir-quality problems also prompted Salt Lake City anesthesiologist Brian Moench to create the doctors' group. With about 80 members now, the doctors emphasize health impacts of pollution to nearby communities.LiNeBrEaK"The public's knowledge of these issues is probably our biggest ally," he says. "The best progress that will be made is through public pressure."LiNeBrEaKJim Westwater, founder of the Utah Valley Sierra Forum, says he rallied inactive Sierra Club members and others interested in environmental issues after he relocated to Utah a couple of years ago. Now over 400 people are part of the network, participating in hikes, cleanups and the group's monthly discussion forums.LiNeBrEaKThe debate has included lively sessions on such issues as the benefits of nuclear power, consumerism and faith and the environment. It's a delicate balance to strike in a community where environmentalism is often shunned.LiNeBrEaKSays Westwater: "We're trying to appeal to people's higher nature."LiNeBrEaKSarah Fields, of Moab-based Uranium Watch, agrees that public education is key. For many years the go-to person for information on all things nuclear in southeastern Utah, Fields now shares the government documents she digs up on the group's Web page.LiNeBrEaKA better-informed community years ago might have gone a long way toward preventing the Atlas uranium-processing mill from becoming a $1 billion hazardous waste cleanup, she says.LiNeBrEaK"It's when you are in the local community -- that's when you know what's going on."LiNeBrEaKIn the end, the proliferation of environmental groups is a trend that's likely to continue, says University of Utah political science professor Dan McCool. It's also bound to be good for democracy, he says.LiNeBrEaK"Small, local groups, can target in a way that national groups cannot."LiNeBrEaKfahys@sltrib.comLiNeBrEaKStudyLiNeBrEaKStudy shows environmental nonprofits on the rise.LiNeBrEaKHere's the link: www.urban.org/publications/411797.html	ENVIRONMENTALISM (93%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (91%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (90%); WATER POLLUTION (89%); AIR QUALITY (89%); AIR POLLUTION (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); PHYSICIANS and SURGEONS (76%); URANIUM MINING (76%); PLATFORMS and ISSUES (75%); PARTICULATE MATTER (75%); PUBLIC POLICY (74%); SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION (74%); LEGISLATORS (73%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (71%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (71%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (69%); POLITICAL SCIENCE (69%); CHILDREN (66%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (90%)  		SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA (92%) UTAH, USA (97%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	January 3, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Salt Lake Tribune   	Judy Fahys, The Salt Lake Tribune  	BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY (56%); URBAN INSTITUTE (55%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	Education  	20090103-ST-Advocacy-groups-greening-Utah-0103  	ST  		BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY (56%)  												
The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	For Utah agriculture, energy efficiency, paperwork sophistication are keys to modern-day survival.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1292 words  	Jan. 3--When it comes to paperwork, Utah farmers and ranchers are failing, and it's costing them thousands of dollars in federal money that could help them be more energy efficient.LiNeBrEaKWhile their national counterparts are collecting millions from grants for renewable-energy projects, state farmers and ranchers are sending off incomplete applications. As many as 90 percent of the grants from Utah are rejected because technical details are faulty or the farmers simply don't understand the questions.LiNeBrEaK"Sometimes it seems like farmers and ranchers totally ignore what the application asks for," said Roger Koon, a specialist with the Rural Development Office in Salt Lake City. "It can be [daunting], but if they'll go step by step and take their time, they can do what's required."LiNeBrEaKBeyond being able (or willing) to follow directions, Utah farmers and ranchers also are behind the curve in their low number of applications, said Misty Conrad, technical assistance program manager for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo., which does grant technical reviews. LiNeBrEaK"These grants are for tried-and-true technology that cuts energy costs," she said. "Utah has a number of fantastic opportunities to get help. We'd love to see more applications coming out of the state."LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Department of Agriculture provides grants and loans to farmers who want to develop renewable-energy or energy-efficiency projects, covering up to 75 percent of the cost.LiNeBrEaKBut in Utah, only 10 percent to 20 percent of the applications submitted are accepted. Projects can include wind towers, refurbishing old hydroelectric equipment or installing solar panels to take advantage of Utah's most abundant energy source.LiNeBrEaKTo add insult to pain, for years Utah farmers have been struggling to make ends meet. Most have day jobs to supplement their incomes, and as choice farmlands are plowed under for housing developments, farmers are being pushed out to marginal lands.LiNeBrEaKA savings of any kind helps the bottom line, and one of the areas their counterparts in other parts of the country rely on is being more energy efficient. Koon calls the drop in gasoline prices only a temporary reprieve from agriculture's high energy costs, and energy experts say there is no magic bullet that will end the nation's dependence on foreign oil.LiNeBrEaKSo, a variety of renewable sources probably will be part of the answer to America's energy problems, according to Tom Potter of the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project and other conservationists.LiNeBrEaKBut running counter to this notion is the Utah Farm Bureau, with its 21,000 members, which insists that the nation must exploit its own oil and coal stocks for the foreseeable future. Because farm leaders aren't convinced there is such a phenomenon as global warming, they see no need to press for wide use of renewable fuels that in their minds may be decades away from being a cost-effective alternative to coal and oil.LiNeBrEaK"There are those in the media ...who claim consensus -- 'that man's activities are the cause of global warming," wrote Farm Bureau CEO Randy Parker in the group's December newsletter. Parker said this claim is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose members are "promoting parochial political agendas."LiNeBrEaKTime at state farm conventions is spent assailing global warming assertions -- leaving it up to individual farmers to develop alternative strategies on their own. The political debate aside, high energy costs probably will require farmers to retool their infrastructure, and with it the infrastructure of the nation's food supply.LiNeBrEaKThis isn't the first time farmers have been forced to confront change. In the 1970s, U.S. producers switched from gasoline to diesel-powered farm equipment. And today, in the face of tight operating margins, some farmers are embracing energy conservation.LiNeBrEaK"I got the message more than 30 years ago that I needed to do everything I could to make my farm energy efficient," said Sevier County alfalfa grower Eric Tuft.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	For Utah agriculture, energy efficiency, paperwork sophistication are keys to modern-day survival  	BUSINESS  	1227 words  	When it comes to paperwork, Utah farmers and ranchers are failing, and it's costing them thousands of dollars in federal money that could help them be more energy efficient.LiNeBrEaKWhile their national counterparts are collecting millions from grants for renewable-energy projects, state farmers and ranchers are sending off incomplete applications. As many as 90 percent of the grants from Utah are rejected because technical details are faulty or the farmers simply don't understand the questions.LiNeBrEaK"Sometimes it seems like farmers and ranchers totally ignore what the application asks for," said Roger Koon, a specialist with the Rural Development Office in Salt Lake City. "It can be [daunting], but if they'll go step by step and take their time, they can do what's required."LiNeBrEaKBeyond being able (or willing) to follow directions, Utah farmers and ranchers also are behind the curve in their low number of applications, said Misty Conrad, technical assistance program manager for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo., which does grant technical reviews. LiNeBrEaK"These grants are for tried-and-true technology that cuts energy costs," she said. "Utah has a number of fantastic opportunities to get help. We'd love to see more applications coming out of the state."LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Department of Agriculture provides grants and loans to farmers who want to develop renewable-energy or energy-efficiency projects, covering up to 75 percent of the cost. But in Utah, only 10 percent to 20 percent of the applications submitted are accepted. Projects can include wind towers, refurbishing old hydroelectric equipment or installing solar panels to take advantage of Utah's most abundant energy source.LiNeBrEaKTo add insult to pain, for years Utah farmers have been struggling to make ends meet. Most have day jobs to supplement their incomes, and as choice farmlands are plowed under for housing developments, farmers are being pushed out to marginal lands.LiNeBrEaKA savings of any kind helps the bottom line, and one of the areas their counterparts in other parts of the country rely on is being more energy efficient. Koon calls the drop in gasoline prices only a temporary reprieve from agriculture's high energy costs, and energy experts say there is no magic bullet that will end the nation's dependence on foreign oil.LiNeBrEaKSo, a variety of renewable sources probably will be part of the answer to America's energy problems, according to Tom Potter of the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project and other conservationists.LiNeBrEaKBut running counter to this notion is the Utah Farm Bureau, with its 21,000 members, which insists that the nation must exploit its own oil and coal stocks for the foreseeable future. Because farm leaders aren't convinced there is such a phenomenon as global warming, they see no need to press for wide use of renewable fuels that in their minds may be decades away from being a cost-effective alternative to coal and oil.LiNeBrEaK"There are those in the media ...who claim consensus -- 'that man's activities are the cause of global warming," wrote Farm Bureau CEO Randy Parker in the group's December newsletter. Parker said this claim is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose members are "promoting parochial political agendas."LiNeBrEaKTime at state farm conventions is spent assailing global warming assertions -- leaving it up to individual farmers to develop alternative strategies on their own. The political debate aside, high energy costs probably will require farmers to retool their infrastructure, and with it the infrastructure of the nation's food supply.LiNeBrEaKThis isn't the first time farmers have been forced to confront change. In the 1970s, U.S. producers switched from gasoline to diesel-powered farm equipment. And today, in the face of tight operating margins, some farmers are embracing energy conservation.LiNeBrEaK"I got the message more than 30 years ago that I needed to do everything I could to make my farm energy efficient," said Sevier County alfalfa grower Eric Tuft. "If our nation had done the same thing, we wouldn't have gotten ourselves in this mess."LiNeBrEaKTuft, 58, began changing his operation in 1973, during the Arab embargo. About the same time, Utah Power and Light increased its rates, eventually tripling costs for Tuft's 100 horsepower irrigation pump.LiNeBrEaKNeither the oil consortium nor his local utility company "showed any mercy," he said.LiNeBrEaKTuft attended energy workshops, read books and later surfed the Internet.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	Advocacy groups greening Utah  	NEWS; State  	701 words  	The grass roots sprouting up around Utah are mostly green.LiNeBrEaKNew environmental groups are sprouting up all over -- contrary to a declaration five years ago that the green movement had grown monolithic, fossilized and died.LiNeBrEaKSome of Utah's new groups focus on neighborhoods, such as the San Juan County community concerned about uranium mining planned for their area.LiNeBrEaKOthers organize constituencies, like the Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment and the Utah Moms for Clean Air. LiNeBrEaKAnd still more focus on a particular environmental problem, like Uranium Watch, concentrating on pollution from nuclear energy, or Urgency Utah, campaigning to bring climate-change solutions to the forefront.LiNeBrEaKBrigham Young University political science professor Kelly Patterson says the sprouting of new green groups makes sense on an issue as diverse as the environment. While Utahns might snub a Washington-based organization focused broadly on national environmental policy, they readily welcome neighbors addressing a problem down the block.LiNeBrEaK"It's what you do about uranium tailings," said Patterson, who studies interest groups. "It's what you do about particulate matter [air pollution], it's what you do about preserving open spaces."LiNeBrEaKThe trend isn't unique to Utah. A new study by the Urban Institute shows that green groups are increasing at nearly double the rate of other kinds of nonprofits. Meanwhile, author Paul Hawken describes the phenomenon as part of a global movement in his book Blessed Unrest .LiNeBrEaKFor Cherise Udell, president and founder of Utah Moms for Clean Air, none of this is surprising.LiNeBrEaKExasperated with the apparent apathy about high-pollution periods in the Salt Lake Valley, she recognized "a need and a niche to be filled" when she launched Moms nearly two years ago.LiNeBrEaK"Caring about the environment has become mainstream," says Udell. "It's no longer a fringe issue."LiNeBrEaKThe group now has an e-mail list of around 1,200 and a track record of accomplishments that include reducing motor vehicle idling at schools and a school-bus retrofitting program intended to lessen children's exposure to polluted exhaust. Members, many with a professional background, have been known to petition lawmakers with a baby balanced on their hips, a loaf of banana bread in one hand and legal documents in the other.LiNeBrEaK"We really brought the air issue to the kitchen table," says Udell.LiNeBrEaKAir-quality problems also prompted Salt Lake City anesthesiologist Brian Moench to create the doctors' group. With about 80 members now, the doctors emphasize health impacts of pollution to nearby communities.LiNeBrEaK"The public's knowledge of these issues is probably our biggest ally," he says. "The best progress that will be made is through public pressure."LiNeBrEaKJim Westwater, founder of the Utah Valley Sierra Forum, says he rallied inactive Sierra Club members and others interested in environmental issues after he relocated to Utah a couple of years ago. Now over 400 people are part of the network, participating in hikes, cleanups and the group's monthly discussion forums.LiNeBrEaKThe debate has included lively sessions on such issues as the benefits of nuclear power, consumerism and faith and the environment. It's a delicate balance to strike in a community where environmentalism is often shunned.LiNeBrEaKSays Westwater: "We're trying to appeal to people's higher nature."LiNeBrEaKSarah Fields, of Moab-based Uranium Watch, agrees that public education is key. For many years the go-to person for information on all things nuclear in southeastern Utah, Fields now shares the government documents she digs up on the group's Web page.LiNeBrEaKA better-informed community years ago might have gone a long way toward preventing the Atlas uranium-processing mill from becoming a $1 billion hazardous waste cleanup, she says.LiNeBrEaK"It's when you are in the local community -- that's when you know what's going on."LiNeBrEaKIn the end, the proliferation of environmental groups is a trend that's likely to continue, says University of Utah political science professor Dan McCool. It's also bound to be good for democracy, he says.LiNeBrEaK"Small, local groups, can target in a way that national groups cannot."LiNeBrEaKfahys@sltrib.com Read moreLiNeBrEaKThe study shows environmental nonprofits are on the rise.

The "Year in Review" list goes on ad infinitum.LiNeBrEaKNot to be outdone, 2009 beckons. Challenges, of course, but also Predictions - and not all of them dire, thankfully. LiNeBrEaKSome "doomsday" predictions you've already heard - deepening recession, continuing mortgage crisis. But seers and mystics are gazing into their crystal balls and prophesying other events that aren't quite so cataclysmic.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, some are downright heavenly.LiNeBrEaKOur friend, Judy Hevenly, Los Angeles-based psychic, author and international lecturer, has made predictions for 2009 on everything from airlines offering WI-FI to a new film studio in the San Bernardino area to a successor for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.LiNeBrEaK"I meditate and think about the world and then it comes to me," said Judy, who on Feb. 9, predicted Barack Obama would be the next president of the United States.LiNeBrEaKAccording to Judy, featured in the book, "The 100 Top Psychics in America," a large environmental government agency could be coming to the San Bernardino area in 2009.LiNeBrEaKSo here's another list - some Hevenly things to look for in 2009:LiNeBrEaK  "Assistance from the Obama administration for the housing and banking sectors; $100billion given to road and bridge work and $15billion a year to green tech investment, school repairs.LiNeBrEaK  "A rising skating champion will become known from the Asian community in San Bernardino.LiNeBrEaK  "An Asian university specializing in health and acupuncture, and training for oriental medicine to help humanity.LiNeBrEaK  "New sightings of UFOs over Big Bear Lake, letting the locals know that they are not alone, that the ETs are close by, watching over them protectively.LiNeBrEaK  "The ghost of Martin Luther King will hover over Presidential-elect Barack Obama on the Inauguration Day ceremony.LiNeBrEaK  "Disneyland Resort in Anaheim will become a panacea for the unemployed to visit during the recession to boost their morale and get a new outlook.LiNeBrEaK  "Lance Armstrong will win the Tour de France in 2009.LiNeBrEaK  "There will be a peace treaty in the Middle East (2009-2010) between Israel and Palestine, with the United States and France playing an important role.LiNeBrEaK  "There will be a mega summit on climate change in Copenhagen in November-December 2009, with the United States, China, Europe - a post-Kyoto agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK  "Cell phone firms to offer free small laptop with Internet services.LiNeBrEaK  "Baby boy for Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes; baby girl for Victoria Beckham.LiNeBrEaK  "President Barack Obama to receive Nobel Peace Prize.LiNeBrEaK  "Andrew Cuomo could possibly be named to replace Hillary Clinton as New York senator.LiNeBrEaK  "Golden Globe winners, 2009: Best Picture - Drama, "Slumdog Millionare"; Best Animated Movie, "Wall-E"; Best Picture - Comedy, "Mama Mia"; Best Actor - Drama, Brad Pitt; Best Actress - Drama, Angelina Jolie; Best Supporting Actor, Heath Ledger; Best Supporting Actress, Penelope Cruz."LiNeBrEaKAnd a new trend?

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	The Globalist Quiz  	NEWS; National; World  	469 words  	THE GLOBALIST QUIZLiNeBrEaKScaling the South PoleLiNeBrEaKThe weekly quiz is provided by The Globalist, a daily online feature service that covers issues and trends in globalization. The non-partisan organization provides commercial services and non-profit educational features. LiNeBrEaKQUESTIONLiNeBrEaKAntarctica is the fifth-largest continent   and is home to the coldest place on Earth. As the world struggles to find a solution to global warming and melting ice in both the North and South poles, we wonder: What is the elevation of the South Pole?LiNeBrEaKANSWERLiNeBrEaKA. Sea levelLiNeBrEaKB. 2,500 meters (8,200 feet)LiNeBrEaKC. 2,800 meters (9,200 feet)LiNeBrEaKD. 4,900 meters (16,100 feet)LiNeBrEaKA.LiNeBrEaKSea level is not correct.LiNeBrEaKIt is the North Pole's elevation   not the South Pole's   that lies roughly at sea level. While the South Pole is near the center of Antarctica   a landmass 1. 7 times larger than Australia   the North Pole is an ice mass located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean. In summer 2008, satellite images revealed that ice in the North Pole had melted to such an extent that for the first time since the beginning of the last Ice Age, passages of open water had been created through the northwest and northeast of the Arctic. Such a passage, which could drastically reduce shipping times, has long been anticipated by shipping companies   but feared by scientists who see it as an example of rapid global warming.LiNeBrEaKB.LiNeBrEaK2,500 meters (8,200 feet) is not correct.LiNeBrEaKThe Antarctic ice sheet   with an average thickness of 2,500 meters (8,200 feet)   contains over 70 percent of the world's fresh water and 90 percent of the world's ice. Scientists have discovered that climate change appears to be destabilizing vast ice sheets of western Antarctica that had previously seemed relatively protected from global warming   raising the prospect of faster-rising sea levels.LiNeBrEaKC.LiNeBrEaK2,800 meters (9,200 feet) is correct.LiNeBrEaKWhile Antarctica as a continent has widely varying elevations, the South Pole is at an elevation of 2,800 meters (9,200 feet). Average temperatures at the South Pole run at -76&deg; F (-60&deg; C) during the coldest month of August   and -18&deg; F (-28&deg; C) during the warmest month of January. Vostok Station in Antarctica, with an elevation of 3,500 meters (11,500 feet), is known as the coldest place on Earth, with an average annual temperature of -67&ordm; F (-55&ordm; C).LiNeBrEaKD.LiNeBrEaK4,900 meters (16,100 feet) is not correct.LiNeBrEaKThe highest mountain in Antarctica is Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,900 meters (16,100 feet). Climbers of this peak must contend with 112 kilometer-per-hour (70 mph) winds. Vinson is one of the "Seven Summits"   the tallest peaks on each continent   revered by mountain climbers. The other summits are Africa's Mount Kilimanjaro, Europe's Mount Elbrus, South America's Mount Aconcagua, North America's Mount McKinley, Asia's Mount Everest and Oceania's Puncak Jaya in Indonesia.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	Homegrown activist ready to be Palo Alto mayor  	COMMUNITIES; Peninsula; News; Local  	888 words  	Peter Drekmeier, a lifelong environmentalist, says his decision to run for Palo Alto City Council in 2005 grew out of his frustration with the previous year's U.S. presidential election. He had worked on the unsuccessful campaign of Democrat John Kerry.LiNeBrEaK"I realized the change we so desperately needed was not going to come from the federal government," Drekmeier said in an interview Friday. To tackle problems such as climate change, "We were going to have to work at the local and grassroots level to get elected." LiNeBrEaKAfter four years on the council, Drekmeier, 45, is poised to become the city's mayor   ironically, just as another green-minded Democrat, Barack Obama, prepares to enter the White House. Like Obama, however, he will have to temper his big-picture environmental agenda with the pressing demands of an economic recession.LiNeBrEaKAs vice mayor, Drekmeier is the likely choice to succeed Larry Klein as mayor in a vote of the Palo Alto City Council on Monday. If chosen, he'll serve for one year, presiding over council meetings and representing the city to the public.LiNeBrEaKThe son of two anti-war Stanford professors, Drekmeier grew up on intimate terms with both political activism and nature.LiNeBrEaKWhen his parents held seminars on social thought at their Sutter Avenue home, Drekmeier said he and his sister stay up late listening at the door. When the family took day trips to the Palo Alto Baylands, he would play in the tidepools and catch lizards and snakes.LiNeBrEaKThose interests intersected soon after he graduated from UC-Berkeley with a political science degree. Looking for inspiration at Stanford's 1989 "You Can Make a Difference" conference, the 24-year-old Drekmeier got excited about a local campaign to publicize the 20th anniversary of Earth Day.LiNeBrEaKHe soon joined the effort full-time, working out of an Emerson Street office that local developer Jim Baer offered to the cause rent-free. As issues coordinator, Drekmeier was tasked with writing fact sheets on little-known phenomena such as global warming.LiNeBrEaKAfter Earth Day 1990, Drekmeier and several of his colleagues continued their advocacy by forming a group called Bay Area Action, a forerunner of the Palo Alto-based environmental nonprofit Acterra.LiNeBrEaKHighlights of his activist career included helping to block a proposed Devil's Slide highway bypass in the 1990s, and spearheading the Stanford Open Space Alliance to pressure Stanford into protecting its foothills through the 2000 general use permit. In 2007, he took a post as program manager for the San Francisco-based Tuolumne River Trust.LiNeBrEaKDrekmeier's environmental work hasn't slowed in his time on the council. At his first priority-setting session, he called for the city to cut back its greenhouse gas emissions, a goal that was codified in the city's Climate Protection Plan in 2007. He also helped drive the city's green building ordinance and zero-waste plan, and lately he's been pushing a plastic bag ban.LiNeBrEaKAt its last meeting in December, the council split over whether to set aside a slice of dedicated parkland in the Baylands for green-waste composting. Drekmeier favored keeping the compost local, arguing that to ship it out of town would counteract the city's climate goals.LiNeBrEaKThe debate ended in a stalemate, with parks backers determined not to blemish the Byxbee Park Hills with an industrial waste operation. But Drekmeier said Friday he's optimistic he can sell his colleagues on a new, cleaner and more compact composting technology.LiNeBrEaKIn the future, he said, in-vessel composting could allow the city to recycle not only yard waste but food waste and sludge, perhaps even converting it to usable energy.LiNeBrEaKIt's typical of Drekmeier to be looking further into the future than most on an environmental issue. But this year, he'll have to make his case against the very immediate backdrop of a grim economy. He admits it will be a challenge.LiNeBrEaK"Obviously the economy is going to be the primary issue," he said. "But there are a lot of ways we can do what's best for the environment and save money in the long run."LiNeBrEaKFor example, Drekmeier hopes to shave consultant fees, instead tapping into the knowledge of residents through citizen groups such as the Community Environmental Action Partnership. Such programs, he says, have the secondary benefit of developing future city leaders.LiNeBrEaKStill, costly plans that save money in the long run could be a tough sell as the city grapples with an immediate budget problem. A December financial update projected a deficit of $2. 6 million in the current fiscal year and $5. 3 million in 2010.LiNeBrEaKDrekmeier said he believes that Palo Alto, and the nation as a whole under Obama, can use the recession as "a real wake-up call" to convert to more sustainable consumption and transportation habits.LiNeBrEaK"I think it's really in our own interest to support more local farmers, produce more energy locally   to be more locally self-reliant," he said. As the government prepares to stimulate the economy by funneling billions into infrastructure projects, "We need to see the environment as our ultimate infrastructure."LiNeBrEaKE-mail Will Oremus at woremus@dailynewsgroup.comLiNeBrEaKAt a glanceLiNeBrEaKWHAT: Palo Alto City Council meetingLiNeBrEaKWHEN: Monday, Jan. 5, 7 p.m.LiNeBrEaKWHERE: Council Chambers, 250 Hamilton Ave.LiNeBrEaKWHY: The council will commend outgoing mayor Larry Klein on his service and elect a new mayor and vice mayor.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	January 03, 2009 Saturday 	HOW CAN OBAMA FIX SO MUCH THAT WENT WRONG?  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A13  	710 words  	I recommend a new article in the current edition of Vanity Fair magazine. It tries to explain how so much could have gone wrong in so few years. In less than eight years, the Bush White House managed to accomplish the following:LiNeBrEaK"The threat of 9/11 ignored. The threat of Iraq hyped and manipulated. Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib. Hurricane Katrina. The shredding of civil liberties. The rise of Iran. Global warming. Economic disaster. How did one two-term presidency go so wrong?" LiNeBrEaKTo that long list I would add a monstrously useless expenditure of human life and taxpayers' limited resources (to wit, the war in Iraq, implied in the Vanity Fair quote but not spelled out) and the decimation of America's financial watchdog system designed to prevent the kind of economic mess we're now experiencing.LiNeBrEaKOne wonders, in retrospect, how the American public could have so misjudged this man to have elected him not once but twice. How is it that voters, seeing the mismanaged war launched and excessive spending well on its way by the end of Bush's first term, could have voted him back into office for another four years of waste and abuse of office?LiNeBrEaKBlame could be placed, in part, on the Democratic Party for nominating Sen. John Kerry , D-Mass., to run against Bush in 2004. Kerry was a terrible candidate, but good judgment and political acumen were hardly required to discern that Kerry would have made a far better president than the one who won re-election. In fact, if he had won in '04, chances are we would have been out of Iraq by now, and much of the mortgage and housing crisis that rocked Wall Street and the global economy would not have taken place.LiNeBrEaKIf America was so spellbound by what I always viewed as the GOP's gross manipulation of the terrorism issue, I would go so far as to say we need to revisit how we elect our presidents. Something in our system is going seriously wrong. Sept. 11 was a horrible event. Still, Americans should have been able to see through Republicans' fear-driven '04 campaign to recognize the danger was more imagined than real.LiNeBrEaKIt's clear that President-elect Barack Obama is a much better choice. As it has been said by some, the grownups are back in town. The GOP's disregard for the benefit of regulation is staggering. But has the Bush administration left behind a mess of such magnanimous proportions that even FDR could not clean it up?LiNeBrEaKAnd is Obama the next FDR? He seems, by all accounts, to have put together a highly capable Cabinet and Cabinet-level team. But whether his economic plan will work is quite another question. Next year at this time we'll know more. Either the economy will have started to recover (in which case Obama's public support will be as resounding as was his victory over Sen. John McCain) or, if the economy isn't recovering, by this time next year impatient supporters may clamor for more or different action.LiNeBrEaKOne issue rarely addressed by the media is inflation. The Bush administration's $770 billion rescue package and Obama's plan to put another $850 billion into public works and green energy, raise the specter of hyperinflation, especially when coupled with the Federal Reserve Bank's lowering of the interest rate to almost zero:LiNeBrEaKThe economic Web site SeekingAlpha.com recounts the German Weimar Republic experience with hyperinflation as follows: Eventually, as a result of the money supply's rapid expansion, the nation's massive foreign debt, and the shrinking economy, German citizens lost all confidence in their currency, and the Weimar Republic experienced one of the worst cases of hyperinflation in modern economic history.LiNeBrEaKSound familiar? I recall, from reading German history, images of Germans taking wheelbarrows full of marks to the bakery to pick up a loaf of bread. And Germany's economic catastrophe paved the way for Adolf Hitler to ascend to power. We must avoid a repeat of that scenario.LiNeBrEaKI do not question the need for a massive infusion of government resources into the economy. I do think, however, more thought needs to be given to what other policies should or could accompany this infusion, to make sure it does not lead to hyperinflation.LiNeBrEaKBonnie Erbe is a TV host and writes this column for Scripps Howard News Service.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 	January 3, 2009 Saturday   4 State / Suncoast Edition	NEW WEB CHANNEL LINKS UP TIMES READERS WITH CAUSES  	TAMPA BAY; Pg. 8B  	364 words  	Tampa Bay residents wanting to help their neighbors during increasingly tough times have a new tool. Volunteering, donating and making a difference are just a click away.LiNeBrEaKThe Do Good Channel is going online. The St. Petersburg Times has a new partnership with good2gether, a search engine and social network that will connect readers to hundreds of local causes. LiNeBrEaKTo log on, go to dogood.tampabay.com. Search by headings or keywords to volunteer, donate, find events, apply for jobs and read articles.LiNeBrEaKGood2gether founder Greg McHale came up with the concept of connecting the public with nonprofit groups during Hurricane Katrina.LiNeBrEaK"The local newspaper is the center of a nonprofit's universe, but there were almost no links, other than the American Red Cross. Yet hundreds responded to Katrina," McHale said.LiNeBrEaKFrom experience launching online charity auctions, McHale knew that nonprofits typically lack the staff and money to update their Web sites. And without significant traffic, he said, "Google can't find it."LiNeBrEaK"Every day newspapers are filled with articles about causes - education, cancer, social injustice, homeless, hunger, global warming. Every one of those articles could - and we would say should - give readers an opportunity to say, 'I should do something about this.'"LiNeBrEaKNow, if readers see a story on the Times' Web site, tampabay.com about the Florida Orchestra having trouble making payroll, a "connect-a-cause" widget can take them to the orchestra's Web site to see how to pitch in. Someone reading a story about how a guide dog saved a life can click to become a trainer.LiNeBrEaK"The online newspaper becomes a call to action for people to get involved," said McHale. "It's a wonderful opportunity in these horrendous economic times for nonprofits to leverage the local market."LiNeBrEaKAny nonprofit organization, school or government agency can sign up to enter all the information it chooses on the DoGood channel, for free.LiNeBrEaKNonprofits also may choose to sell sponsorships, links and logos on their profiles, and share the revenue with good2gether. This is entirely optional. Sponsors pay a minimum of $100, and the organization keeps 65 cents of every dollar. (Good2gether keeps 35 cents.)

Tampa Tribune (Florida) 	January 3, 2009 Saturday   FINAL EDITION	Proposed Landfill Carries 'Good Deal' Of Risk, Group Warns Advocates  	PASCO; Pg. 2  	629 words  	By CARL ROTHLiNeBrEaKSpecial to the TribuneLiNeBrEaKBoth the "Landfill A Good Deal for Pasco" (Dec. 26) and the Tom Jackson "Really Green" (Dec. 28) opinions really miss the mark on the dump that is proposed to be built near the Green Swamp, source of the Floridan Aquifer.LiNeBrEaKThe Florida Consumer Action Network has joined Jackson and the Nature Coast Sierra Club in support of this catastrophe after "drinking the Kool-Aid" (misinformation) that the landfill applicant is providing. It is interesting to our citizens group, Protectors of Florida's Legacy, that every entity expressing support for the dump has chosen not to hear any other perspectives before issuing their endorsements. LiNeBrEaKThat is certainly unfortunate, because every business/environmental/homeowner organization, city (Dade City, Zephyrhills, Tampa), and several of our elected officials who have heard both points of view oppose the dump at the proposed location, given the environmental harm, economic risk and health hazard it introduces to the Tampa Bay region.LiNeBrEaKOur group has reviewed all three permit applications submitted to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and they reference the acceptance of as much as 3,000 tons of waste per day at as much as $70 per ton. That compares with the $56. 70 per ton that Pasco County charges - a figure that includes recycling.LiNeBrEaKThere is no bioreactor landfill (new technology without state or federal standards) proposed, and it is doubtful there ever will be. So, initially landfill gases (methane, carbon dioxide, mercury, etc.) will simply be vented into the atmosphere, further contributing to global warming. This is in addition to the significant truck traffic (1,000 trucks per day) that would add congestion to the local roads. Savvy, concerned citizens recognize this for the Trojan horse that it is.LiNeBrEaKWe have visited large state-permitted landfills, such as the one in St. Lucie County, along the turnpike. It attracts so many birds that the sky above the site is dark with them. Not to mention the noxious odor that is harmful to one's health.LiNeBrEaKAccording to state landfill regulations, only a tarpaulin is required to cover the exposed garbage for six days a week, forcing residents to breathe these smells. If the applicant follows the rules, the garbage would only have to be covered one day - Sunday. The company has not demonstrated consistent diligence with its adjoining construction landfill in this arena, being cited for odors and lack of sufficient cover for basic construction debris.LiNeBrEaKOur group is continuing to monitor this project closely and making information available to all parties (large and small) interested in all the facts about the proposed dump. What irks the applicant about our group is that we took the initiative to build awareness in the surrounding impacted communities, and our activities have been 100 percent funded out of our own pockets.LiNeBrEaKWe support landowners large and small in the effort to protect our limited drinking water supplies that this dump will ultimately destroy. The DEP is right now planning to declare a portion of the Floridan Aquifer in Orlando, below a facility that was operated under current regulatory rules, a "wasteland unfit for drinking water supplies."LiNeBrEaKThe applicant has not demonstrated in its permit application that the proposed location is not a risk to sinkhole collapse, and the DEP should learn from these past mistakes that the proposed location near the Withlacoochee and Hillsborough rivers is a "time bomb" just waiting to happen.LiNeBrEaKCarl Roth is the spokesman for Protectors of Florida's Legacy, which opposes the landfill Angelo's Aggregate Materials wants to build outside of Dade City.

Vallejo Times Herald (California) 	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	Walruses in our midst ...  	NEWS  	680 words  	Wild rides and wildlife shows are not all Vallejo's Six Flags Discovery Kingdom is about - there's a quiet scientific side behind the scenes, as well.LiNeBrEaKAnd that side is suddenly gaining new traction as the park's scientists work to help preserve the walrus, said spokeswoman Nancy Chan.LiNeBrEaKHolley Muraco, the park's marine mammal reproductive specialist, is working to study the breeding habits of walruses - something difficult to do in the wild. LiNeBrEaKThe efforts come at a time when the walrus' status in the ecological scheme of things is in question. The Center for Biological Diversity reportedly sued the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne last month for failing to act on a petition seeking protection for walruses under the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaKAlaskan walruses are threatened by global warming that melts the Arctic sea ice they use, and also by oil and gas development, according to the group.LiNeBrEaK"Polar bears are always the poster child for global warming, but what about the walruses?" Chan said.LiNeBrEaKBecause of the unique opportunity offered by the park, the breeding habits of Discovery Kingdom's 2,200 pound Pacific walrus Sivuqaq (the ancient Yupik name for the village of Gambell, Alaska) and his two female companions Uquq (blubber) and Sika (ice) have become the subject of some intense study. In fact, Muraco is creating an artificial vagina in the hope of interesting Sivuqaq in performing sexual acts that can be analyzed and quantified, she said.LiNeBrEaKIf everything goes according to plan, the male, nicknamed Jocko for his starring role in the Adam Sandler / Drew Barrymore film "50 First Dates," would by this means provide scientists their first walrus semen sample, Muraco said.LiNeBrEaKThough she's constructed similar body parts for horses, cows and pigs, those creatures' breeding habits are much less of a mystery. Pacific walruses, on the other hand, live in a remote part of the world and breeding activity takes place under water, making observation and study nearly impossible in the wild, Muraco said.LiNeBrEaKThe Discovery Kingdom walruses, whose mothers were killed during a hunt, came to the park from the Bering Sea as 2-week-old unrelated orphans about 14 years ago, Muraco said. They were hand-raised and trained by park experts, which is one reason it's even possible to do the various tests and examinations being performed, she said.LiNeBrEaKAny semen collected will act as a baseline for further study and can be frozen in the park's on-site sperm bank as a sort of insurance policy against the extinction of the species, Muraco said."We don't know what the future is going to be for these arctic species, so this is important," she said.LiNeBrEaK"There are about 30 walruses spread out among only seven facilities in the country, and if this works, we'll share information and techniques so we can add more data to compare," said Discovery Kingdom's animal care director, and Muraco's husband, Mike Muraco.LiNeBrEaK"We are ground zero here with regard to walrus breeding," Holley Muraco said. "It's a big, open area of study as it is with many exotic species."LiNeBrEaKOne reason the Muracos and other park animal experts started brainstorming walrus research ideas about a year ago, is the fact that though the walruses are sexually active, they have yet to produce offspring. This may be because of the animals' youth, but that's one answer the scientists seek.LiNeBrEaKWalruses like Jocko can grow to 4,000 pounds and typically live up to about 30 years, Mike Muraco said.LiNeBrEaKAs the walrus research goes forward, Holley Muraco will monitor the animals' hormones, use ultrasound, take blood tests and vaginal swabs to determine the females winter breeding cycle season, and watch them mate under water, in addition to making the latex or rubber artificial vagina into which semen can be collected. The trio are uncomplaining participants in the examinations and testing, she said.LiNeBrEaK"They're not shy with their sexuality," Holley Muraco said. "They're trained to cooperate with these exams. They just lay back and relax."LiNeBrEaK  E-mail Rachel Raskin-Zrihen at RachelZ@thnewsnet.com or call 553-6824.

The Washington Post 	January 3, 2009 Saturday   Every Edition	Lessons From L.A.  	FINANCIAL; Pg. F02  	607 words  	Last month, I may have glimpsed the Washington region's future -- I spent five days in sprawling, traffic-choked Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaKTo be sure, L.A. has wonderful museums and art collections, provocative architecture, first-class restaurants, spectacular hillside homes overlooking the city, and charming beachfront communities lining the coast. But if Los Angeles is predictive of Washington's fate, we should be worried. And we should learn the lessons it teaches. LiNeBrEaKThe infamous freeway congestion is more horrendous than ever, as are some of L.A.'s aggressive drivers. Except for local neighborhood trips, it routinely takes 45 minutes or more to drive anywhere. Unless you travel only between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., your average freeway speed will be in the single digits.LiNeBrEaKThe only good freeway news is that automobile emissions-control technology has greatly reduced the legendary smog.LiNeBrEaKThe vastness of greater Los Angeles, home to more than 10 million inhabitants, is hard to comprehend. It stretches nearly 40 miles along the Pacific coast and extends dozens of miles inland, across low mountain ranges and broad valleys. Close to 1,000 square miles, it's the size of some European countries and the state of Rhode Island.LiNeBrEaKLos Angeles is an aggregation of counties encompassing large and small municipalities and economically diverse neighborhoods. Exclusive subdivisions cling to the sides of canyons and hills. Retail-strip boulevards and streets run between high-density, multi-use urban cores.LiNeBrEaKThere's a downtown with an iconic city hall and other municipal buildings; high-rise office, hotel and apartment towers; museums, theaters and concert halls; parking garages; places to shop and dine; and public parks. But greater L.A. is truly polycentric,  with many downtowns scattered about its patchwork quilt of "edge cities."LiNeBrEaKThe freeways, plus the transit and bus lines, vainly attempt to stitch together this sprawling megalopolis. But nonstop demographic and physical expansion has far exceeded the capacity of the transportation system.LiNeBrEaKLos Angeles is also an environmental paradox. Its progressively minded citizens enthusiastically embrace energy conservation and sustainability, claiming to set an example for other states and cities. Californians are genuinely concerned about climate change and about stressed and diminishing natural resources. One sees more gas-electric hybrid cars in L.A. than anywhere else.LiNeBrEaKYet one wonders why California has allowed so much growth, far in excess of what its infrastructure and ecology can support. After all, Southern California is a subtropical desert with a finite supply of water, a less-than-stable landscape naturally prone to earthquakes, flash floods and mudslides, and frequent droughts and wildfires.LiNeBrEaKFor example, the Pacific Coast Highway near Malibu abuts steep cliffs dotted with remnants of collapsed homes and buttressed at frequent intervals by retaining walls and tie-back structures to deter erosion and further collapse. Yet new buildings are being erected on cliff-side sites only a few feet from previous collapses. Why are nature's lessons going unlearned, and, even more surprising, why are building permits being issued for such sites?LiNeBrEaKCalifornians could have managed growth more diligently to ensure that development and infrastructure were synchronized and, equally important, that only environmentally suitable land could be developed.LiNeBrEaKMaybe we need Los Angeles to teach us what not to do, but it remains to be seen whether Washington will learn and act on the lessons.LiNeBrEaKRoger K.

The Washington Post 	January 3, 2009 Saturday   Regional Edition	Cash Guzzlers;  The costly contradictions in bailing out GMAC 	EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A12  	457 words  	ARECESSION of unknown severity and duration now grips the United States and the rest of the world. In response, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have thrown out the free-market rulebook, pumping massive amounts of taxpayer money into the financial sector and the auto industry.  This year, there will probably be more federal intervention, in the form of spending on public infrastructure and perhaps a new infusion for the car companies as well. The argument for breaking all the capitalist taboos is that the alternative would be worse; once the economy has stabilized, the government will retreat, and both businesses and households will submit once again to the usual market discipline. LiNeBrEaKFair enough. But it's still wise to reflect, every so often, on the insidious costs of all bailouts, lest emergency measures evolve into standard operating procedure. Today's lesson in moral hazard has to do with the recent federal rescue of GMAC, the financial arm of General Motors -- which officially closed on the first $4 billion of a separate $13. 4 billion bailout on New Year's Eve.LiNeBrEaKThe Federal Reserve has allowed GMAC to convert itself into a bank, and Treasury promptly infused $5 billion -- plus another $1 billion to GM itself to buy more equity in GMAC. Grateful, GM has begun offering car buyers five-year,  interest-free financing deals through GMAC.LiNeBrEaKSounds great, until you consider which models GM seeks to move off its lots courtesy of this federal largess. For the most part, they are unpopular, gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicles, such as the 2008 Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy and Saab 9-7X. None of these cars gets better than 16 miles per gallon in city driving or 21 mpg on the highway. The biggest TrailBlazer model emits 14. 1 tons of greenhouse gases per year (about twice as much as a Toyota Camry). And car reviewers have given all of these vehicles poor marks for performance and reliability. With a price tag ranging from about $28,000 to $38,000, it's little wonder that annual TrailBlazer sales were down 42 percent through November or that Envoy ($31,000 to $36,000 apiece) sales were off 49 percent.LiNeBrEaKIn short, through the GMAC bailout, the U.S. government is enabling GM to overcome (or try to overcome) the market's resistance to its inferior merchandise -- and it is doing so in a way that directly clashes with public goals such as conserving energy and fighting global warming. Perhaps this will indeed be, as GM has vaguely promised, the last hurrah for the second-rate, U.S.-built SUV -- or perhaps the government has purchased GM a chance to fail at something new. Either way, it's another reason to look forward to the recession's end and to the swiftest possible decoupling of government and big business.

LiNeBrEaKWe need to make sure our leaders don't put the bulk of taxpayer money toward building more highways; that approach won't fix our problems.LiNeBrEaKTraffic congestion devours economic productivity, and, just six weeks ago, gas prices were a major burden for many households. As leaders craft a plan to stimulate the economy, it is equally important that they invest in projects that will reduce our dependence on oil, curb global warming and create green jobs.LiNeBrEaKDwight D. Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System was visionary in the 1950s, but it's time for a new approach. We need a 21st-century transportation system complete with robust local transit and intercity high-speed rail.LiNeBrEaKThe economic stimulus plan provides a unique opportunity to choose the direction of transportation in America. Our leaders must avoid the tempting shortcut of the "Carbon Highway" and instead get on track at "Green Station" for a 21st-century transportation system.LiNeBrEaKKRISTI HORVATHLiNeBrEaKPolicy AssociateLiNeBrEaKMaryland Public Interest Research GroupLiNeBrEaKBaltimoreLiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&middot;LiNeBrEaKThe debate over the federal economic stimulus package has involved a false conflict between the economy and the environment: Supposedly we must choose between creating jobs by building roads that facilitate sprawling development and helping the environment by waiting for wind turbine projects to be ready [" 'Green' Jobs Compete for Stimulus Aid," front page, Dec. 24].LiNeBrEaKIn reality, there is no shortage of ready-to-start infrastructure repair projects that would put people back to work as readily as building new things would. "Fix it first" is a concept that helps the economy and the environment at the same time. Construction workers could be on the job tomorrow resurfacing roads, retrofitting buildings and repairing damaged sewer lines.LiNeBrEaKIt defies common sense to build new roads, sewers and office parks when we're not maintaining the ones we have. If governors and local officials aren't including enough reconstruction projects on their wish lists for the stimulus package, the incoming administration would do well to keep sending the lists back until they do.LiNeBrEaKELIZABETH RIDLINGTONLiNeBrEaKBaltimoreLiNeBrEaKThe writer is a policy analyst at a think tank that advocates stronger environmental laws and consults to environmental organizations.

Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News 	January 3, 2009 Saturday 	Walruses in our midst ...: And Six Flags works to keep it that way  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	752 words  	Jan. 3--Wild rides and wildlife shows are not all Vallejo's Six Flags Discovery Kingdom is about -- there's a quiet scientific side behind the scenes, as well.LiNeBrEaKAnd that side is suddenly gaining new traction as the park's scientists work to help preserve the walrus, said spokeswoman Nancy Chan.LiNeBrEaKHolley Muraco, the park's marine mammal reproductive specialist, is working to study the breeding habits of walruses -- something difficult to do in the wild. LiNeBrEaKThe efforts come at a time when the walrus' status in the ecological scheme of things is in question. The Center for Biological Diversity reportedly sued the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne last month for failing to act on a petition seeking protection forLiNeBrEaKwalruses under the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaKAlaskan walruses are threatened by global warming that melts the Arctic sea ice they use, and also by oil and gas development, according to the group.LiNeBrEaK"Polar bears are always the poster child for global warming, but what about the walruses?" Chan said.LiNeBrEaKBecause of the unique opportunity offered by the park, the breeding habits of Discovery Kingdom's 2,200 pound Pacific walrus Sivuqaq (the ancient Yupik name for the village of Gambell, Alaska) and his two female companions Uquq (blubber) and Sika (ice) have become the subject of some intense study. In fact, Muraco is creating an artificial vagina in the hope of interesting Sivuqaq in performing sexual acts that can be analyzed and quantified,LiNeBrEaKshe said.LiNeBrEaKIf everything goes according to plan, the male, nicknamed Jocko for his starring role in the Adam Sandler / Drew Barrymore film "50 First Dates," would by this means provide scientists their first walrus semen sample, Muraco said.LiNeBrEaKThough she's constructed similar body parts for horses, cows and pigs, those creatures' breeding habits are much less of a mystery. Pacific walruses, on the other hand, live in a remote part of the world and breeding activity takes place under water,LiNeBrEaKmaking observation and study nearly impossible in the wild, Muraco said.LiNeBrEaKThe Discovery Kingdom walruses, whose mothers were killed during a hunt, came to the park from the Bering Sea as 2-week-old unrelated orphans about 14 years ago, Muraco said. They were hand-raised and trained by park experts, which is one reason it's even possible to do the various tests and examinations being performed, she said.LiNeBrEaKAny semen collected will act as a baseline for further study and can be frozen in the park's on-site sperm bank as a sort of insurance policy against the extinction of the species, Muraco said."We don't know what the future is going to be for these arctic species, so this is important," she said.LiNeBrEaK"There are about 30 walruses spread out among only seven facilities in the country, and if this works, we'll share information and techniques so we can add more data to compare," said Discovery Kingdom's animal care director, and Muraco's husband, Mike Muraco.LiNeBrEaK"We are ground zero here with regard to walrus breeding," Holley Muraco said. "It's a big, open area of study as it is with many exotic species."LiNeBrEaKOne reason the Muracos and other park animal experts started brainstorming walrus research ideas about a year ago, is the fact that though the walruses are sexually active, they have yet to produce offspring. This may be because of the animals' youth, but that's one answer the scientists seek.LiNeBrEaKWalruses like Jocko can grow to 4,000 pounds and typically live up to about 30 years, Mike Muraco said.LiNeBrEaKAs the walrus research goes forward, Holley Muraco will monitor the animals' hormones, use ultrasound, take blood tests and vaginal swabs to determine the females winter breeding cycle season, and watch them mate under water, in addition to making the latex or rubber artificial vagina into which semen can be collected. The trio are uncomplaining participants in the examinations and testing, she said.LiNeBrEaK"They're not shy with their sexuality," Holley Muraco said. "They're trained to cooperate with these exams. They just lay back and relax."LiNeBrEaK--E-mail Rachel Raskin-Zrihen at RachelZ@thnewsnet.com or call 553-6824.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 	January 2, 2009 Friday   Online Edition	Jay Bookman;  The 'FDR made Depression worse' fantasy 		443 words  	Friday, January 2, 2009, 08: 49 AMLiNeBrEaKOne the more remarkable aspects of the modern conservative movement is its eagerness to believe whatever it prefers to believe, whatever gives conservatives ammunition against their opponents, regardless of the facts and data and expert opinion. LiNeBrEaKThe latest example of such behavior is the claim that FDR's New Deal extended and deepened the Great Depression, a newly formed myth that is without any basis in fact. Yet it is embraced by some on the right solely because it bolsters their argument against policies proposed by President-elect Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKIt's telling that in its last days in power, the Bush administration isn't having much truck with that notion, having proposed significant stimulus packages of its own and agreeing to bail out Detroit over protests from the hard right. Bush officials recognize that our economic situation is so grave as to preclude political point-scoring. But those without the burden of responsibility are free to, well, just make stuff up.LiNeBrEaKDavid Sirota, writing in Salon, has a nice piece debunking the FDR claim, not that it matters much. People willing to believe that the Clintons killed Vince Foster and there's no such thing as global warming can talk themselves into believing almost anything. You can't reason someone out of a position when reason had nothing whatsoever to do with putting there in the first place.LiNeBrEaKWrites Sirota:LiNeBrEaK"On deeper examination, I discovered that the right bases its New Deal revisionism on the short-lived recession in a year straddling 1937 and 1938. But that was four years into Roosevelt's term --- four years marked by spectacular economic growth. Additionally, the fleeting decline happened not because of the New Deal's spending programs, but because Roosevelt momentarily listened to conservatives and backed off them. As Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman notes, in 1937-38, FDR "was persuaded to balance the budget" and "cut spending and the economy went back down again...."LiNeBrEaK"Excepting 1937-1938, unemployment fell each year of Roosevelt's first two terms [while] the U.S. economy grew at average annual growth rates of 9 percent to 10 percent," writes University of California historian Eric Rauchway...LiNeBrEaKOK --- if the verifiable evidence proves the New Deal did not prolong the Depression, what about historians --- do they "pretty much agree" on the opposite?LiNeBrEaKAgain, no.LiNeBrEaKAs Newsweek's Daniel Gross reports, "One would be very hard-pressed to find a serious professional historian who believes that the New Deal prolonged the Depression."LiNeBrEaKhttp://www.ajc.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/ajc/bookman/entries/2009/01/02/the_fdr_made_depression_worse.html	ECONOMIC DEPRESSION (89%); GREAT DEPRESSION (89%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (88%); RECESSION (76%); ECONOMIC NEWS (76%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (74%); BAILOUTS (74%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (73%); AWARDS and PRIZES (73%); NOBEL PRIZES (68%); UNEMPLOYMENT RATES (68%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (68%); HUMANITIES and SOCIAL SCIENCE (64%); HISTORY (64%); BUDGET (62%); GLOBAL WARMING (51%); US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009 (78%) Blogs  	BARACK OBAMA (57%); PAUL KRUGMAN (53%)  	CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 14, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspapers  	2009 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution   	JAY BOOKMAN; Staff  																					
The Baltimore Sun (Maryland)  	January 2, 2009 Friday 	EDITORIAL: A New Year's resolution: The consequences of global climate change are too great to afford delay ? the incoming president should move quickly for clean energy and carbon reforms  	COMMENTARY  	597 words  	Jan. 2--With the recession deepening and numerous other world crises brewing, President-elect Barack Obama may be tempted to postpone any action on global warming until after his first year in office. This would be a huge mistake for a host of reasons, but most particularly because time is running out for mankind to take the needed actions to thwart the most disastrous effects of climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe planet is not merely approaching a perilous situation when it comes to the effects of man-made greenhouse gases; that day has already arrived. The relevant scientific community has reached a clear consensus: Many decades of unchecked fossil fuel consumption has pushed the planet far beyond the natural cycle, and the impact of this enhanced warming, especially the forecast rise in sea level this century, could ultimately lead to human suffering on an epic scale. LiNeBrEaKCertainly, there are other pressing issues facing the incoming administration. Difficult foreign policy challenges from the Middle East to North Korea and the lagging economy and continuing woes in the credit and real estate markets are more than enough to keep any White House occupied.LiNeBrEaKBut the harmful effects of climate change, while not necessarily as immediate as some other potential threats, could outweigh them all over the long term. And little will be accomplished this year to reduce global warming without U.S. leadership that's been absent far too long.LiNeBrEaKDuring the campaign, Mr. Obama pledged to take many of the necessary steps to move the nation toward a low-carbon economy. He endorsed a reasonable cap-and-trade system that would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050. And he promised to move the country away from foreign oil and toward renewable energy and so-called green jobs.LiNeBrEaKNothing has changed that should defer these goals. The president-elect even has a ready vehicle to help get a lower carbon economy rolling in the proposed multibillion-dollar economic stimulus package that he wants Congress to pass. The plan ought to include major new investment in alternative sources of power, energy conservation programs, public transportation and other green opportunities.LiNeBrEaKAt the very least, the U.S. needs to have its new policies in place before next December's conference in Copenhagen when representatives from 170 countries will push for a new climate change treaty under United Nations auspices. There is no better chance to assert U.S. interests -- or to put the world on a path toward change -- than to demonstrate a willingness to engage in an issue the Bush administration spent most of eight years merely denying.LiNeBrEaKMake no mistake, there will be significant opposition in Congress and from certain deep-pocketed traditional energy interests such as coal producers. Flat-earth types and other naysayers will no doubt suggest that an economic downturn is no time for added burdens on the business community. Some delay may even appeal to the president-elect with centrist tendencies.LiNeBrEaKBut none of the global warming remedies is apt to happen overnight, and the cost of delay is far greater -- not only for the business community but for everyone living on the planet.

Beaver County Times (Pennsylvania)  	January 2, 2009 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Abstinence programs don't work, yet many won't acknowledge that  	COMMENTARY  	385 words  	Jan. 2--Some religious fundamentalists in the United States refuse to be confused by the facts.LiNeBrEaKAbstinence-only sex education provides the latest example of their inability to reconcile ideology with reality. (However, their refusal to acknowledge the sound scientific basis of evolution and global warming remain at the top of the charts.) LiNeBrEaKThe Washington Post reported that new analysis of data from a large federal survey found that more than half of youths became sexually active before marriage regardless of whether they had taken a "virginity pledge."LiNeBrEaKWhat was particularly significant was that the analysis found the percentage who took precautions against pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases was 10 points lower for pledgers than for non-pledgers, the paper reported.LiNeBrEaKBasically, teens who pledged to remain virgins until marriage were more likely to participate in unsafe, premarital sex than those who did not.LiNeBrEaKAlthough earlier studies had raised questions about the effectiveness of abstinence-only programs, this analysis is significant because it focused on teens who had similar values about sex and other issues before they took a virginity pledge. This was an apples-to-apples comparison.LiNeBrEaKHowever, the sound basis of this analysis didn't stop religious conservatives from dismissing its conclusions. They trotted out that usual experts-did-flawed-research argument.LiNeBrEaKThat won't fly. The study analyzed data collected by the federal government's National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, which gathered detailed information from a representative sample of about 11,000 students in grades seven through 12 in 1995, 1996 and 2001.LiNeBrEaKDespite what its critics contend, sex education is a public health issue, not a moral one. It should be taught as such without outside interference, especially by those who place their religious and ideological agendas ahead of the public good.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 2, 2009 Friday 	Obama will face Bush legacy on environment  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	878 words  	Jan. 2--WASHINGTON -- President George W. Bush could be forcing President-elect Barack Obama to act almost immediately to curb global warming, after years of the Bush administration fighting attempts to crack down on greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKOr, depending on which interpretation prevails, Bush could be giving his successor much-needed breathing room on a volatile issue. LiNeBrEaKIn its final weeks, the Bush administration has moved to close what it calls "back doors" to regulating carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. It barred the Environmental Protection Agency from considering the effects of global warming on protected species. And it excluded carbon dioxide from a list of pollutants the EPA regulates under the Clean Air Act.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists call the moves a last-minute attempt to block speedy, executive action by the president's successor on climate change, an issue that Obama calls a top concern. But they say it could backfire, by prompting lawsuits and fueling fights over coal-fired power plants that the new administration would need to resolve quickly.LiNeBrEaKObama "now has to clean up a mess," said David Bookbinder, chief climate counsel for the Sierra Club, which has challenged the EPA over the Clean Air Act decision and plans to sue to block it. "They're forcing him to act sooner than he otherwise might have."LiNeBrEaKYet energy-industry lobbyists predict the challenges will fail. They say the Bush administration's actions give Obama time and political cover to take a more deliberative approach to emissions regulation and avoid overly broad, overly swift rules that could slow construction projects for schools and businesses, not just power plants.LiNeBrEaK"I'm quite confident that the Obama administration will have no interest in coming in and immediately reversing" the decisions, said Jeffrey Holmstead, a former EPA clean air administrator who now represents energy industry clients at the lobbying firm Bracewell and Giuliani in Washington.LiNeBrEaKUnderlying the debate is the issue of how the federal government should reduce America's emissions of the gases scientists blame for global warming, including carbon dioxide. Congress has long debated, but never approved, a so-called cap-and-trade system to limit carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKFrustrated, environmental groups have looked for other ways to fight global warming. They have pressed to list the polar bear, which has seen its habitat dwindle as arctic ice melts, as a threatened species. The Interior Department consented this summer, but later declared that any protection for the bears under the Endangered Species Act didn't extend to regulating greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups also sued to force the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court ruled the EPA had the power to do that, but administration officials have declined to exercise it.LiNeBrEaKEPA Administrator Steven Johnson issued a memo in late December -- as part of a review for a proposed coal-fired power plant expansion in Utah -- that excludes carbon dioxide from the list of pollutants the government must regulate under the Clean Air Act when approving construction projects.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists called the memo a gift to the coal industry and utilities.LiNeBrEaK"This is a desperate attempt to interfere with the Obama administration's ability to deal with greenhouse gases from power plants," said John Walke, a former EPA attorney who is now clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council.LiNeBrEaKIndustry lobbyists say the memo leaves the door open for Obama to regulate carbon dioxide eventually through the EPA -- and that it gives him time to solve a wider problem. A broad rule, they say, risks lumping school expansions, office construction and even some home building into the same regulatory process a power plant would face.LiNeBrEaKThe memo allows Obama's team time to solve those issues, Holmstead maintains, so "they don't sweep in hundreds of thousands of small building projects around the country."LiNeBrEaKObama vows to push aggressively for a cap-and-trade bill as president. Under this method of trading, overall air quality goals are set by the government, and individual facilities such as power plants are given allowances for what they can emit. Facilities that pollute less than they are permitted can trade a share of their allowance to others that pollute more.LiNeBrEaKAnd the president-elect's top energy adviser promised during the campaign that Obama would move to regulate carbon under the Clean Air Act within 18 months of taking office.LiNeBrEaKNow, environmentalists say, Bush has put pressure on Obama to act sooner -- or risk watching states approve new power plants without regard to carbon emissions. Energy companies have taken quick notice of the EPA memo: Duke Energy recently cited it in a court filing supporting its bid to build a new coal-fired plant in Indiana.LiNeBrEaKjtankersley@tribune.com	AIR QUALITY REGULATION (91%); EMISSIONS (90%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (89%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (89%); LOBBYING (89%); US PRESIDENTS (91%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); POWER PLANTS (77%); ENERGY and UTILITY TRADE (77%); ENDANGERED SPECIES (76%); SCIENCE NEWS (75%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (75%); MAMMALS (75%); BIOLOGY (75%); THREATENED and SENSITIVE SPECIES (75%); DECISIONS and RULINGS (73%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (72%); SETTLEMENTS and DECISIONS (72%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (72%); MAJOR US LAW FIRMS (71%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (69%); SUPREME COURTS (66%); WILDLIFE (64%); CONSTRUCTION (50%)  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); GEORGE W BUSH (94%)  	CHICAGO, IL, USA (85%) ILLINOIS, USA (85%) UNITED STATES (97%); ARCTIC (79%)  	January 3, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Chicago Tribune   	Jim Tankersley, Chicago Tribune  	US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (57%); SIERRA CLUB (55%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	Construction  	20090102-TB-Obama-will-face-Bush-legacy-on-environment-0102  	TB  	NYSE:DUK  	BRACEWELL and GIULIANI LLP (53%)  												
Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 2, 2009 Friday 	Canada's forests, once huge help on greenhouse gases, now contribute to climate change: Canada's vast forests, once huge absorbers of greenhouse gases, now add to problem  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1084 words  	Jan. 2--VANCOUVER -- As relentlessly bad as the news about global warming seems to be, with ice at the poles melting faster than scientists had predicted and world temperatures rising higher than expected, there was at least a reservoir of hope stored here in Canada's vast forests.LiNeBrEaKThe country's 1. 2 million square miles of trees have been dubbed the "lungs of the planet" by ecologists because they account for more than 7 percent of Earth's total forest lands. They could always be depended upon to suck in vast quantities of carbon dioxide, naturally cleansing the world of much of the harmful heat-trapping gas. LiNeBrEaKBut not anymore.LiNeBrEaKIn an alarming yet little-noticed series of recent studies, scientists have concluded that Canada's precious forests, stressed from damage caused by global warming, insect infestations and persistent fires, have crossed an ominous line and are now pumping out more climate-changing carbon dioxide than they are sequestering.LiNeBrEaKWorse yet, the experts predict that Canada's forests will remain net carbon sources, as opposed to carbon storage "sinks," until at least 2022, and possibly much longer.LiNeBrEaK"We are seeing a significant distortion of the natural trend," said Werner Kurz, senior research scientist at the Canadian Forest Service and the leading expert on carbon cycles in the nation's forests. "Since 1999, and especially in the last five years, the forests have shifted from being a carbon sink to a carbon source."LiNeBrEaKTranslation: Earth's lungs have come down with emphysema. Canada's forests are no longer our friends.LiNeBrEaKSo serious is the problem that Canada's federal government effectively wrote off the nation's forests in 2007 as officials submitted their plans to abide by the international Kyoto Protocol, which obligates participating governments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKUnder the Kyoto agreement, governments are permitted to count forest lands as credits, or offsets, when calculating their national carbon emissions. But Canadian officials, aware of the scientific studies showing that their forests actually are emitting excess carbon, quietly omitted the forest lands from their Kyoto compliance calculations.LiNeBrEaK"The forecast analysis prepared for the government ... indicates there is a probability that forests would constitute a net source of greenhouse gas emissions," a Canadian Environment Ministry spokesman told the Montreal Gazette.LiNeBrEaKCanadian officials say global warming is causing the crisis in their forests. Inexorably rising temperatures are slowly drying out forest lands, leaving trees more susceptible to fires, which release huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKHigher temperatures also are accelerating the spread of a deadly pest known as the mountain pine beetle, which has devastated pine forests across British Columbia and is threatening vital timber in the neighboring province of Alberta. More than 50,000 square miles of British Columbia's pine forest have been stricken so far with the telltale markers of death: needles that turn bright red before falling off the tree.LiNeBrEaKBitter cold Canadian winters used to kill off much of the pine beetle population each year, naturally keeping it in check. But the milder winters of recent years have allowed the insect to proliferate.LiNeBrEaK"That's what's causing some of our forests to switch from a carbon sink position to a source position," said Jim Snetsinger, British Columbia's chief forester. "Once those infested trees are killed by the pine beetle, they are no longer sequestering carbon -- they are giving it off."LiNeBrEaKSnetsinger noted that eventually, over the course of a generation, some of the dying forests will begin to regenerate and once again begin storing more carbon than they release. But for the foreseeable future, experts say, their models show that Canada's forests will stay stuck in a vicious global-warming cycle, both succumbing to the effects of climate change and, as they decay and release more carbon, helping to accelerate it.LiNeBrEaKThat grim reality is stoking a new debate over commercial logging, one of Canada's biggest industries.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists contend that the extreme stresses on Canada's forests, particularly the old-growth northern forest, mean that logging ought to be sharply curtailed to preserve the remaining trees -- and the carbon stored within them -- for as long as possible.LiNeBrEaKMoreover, they argue that the disruptive process of logging releases even more carbon stored in the forest peat, threatening to set off what they describe as a virtual "carbon bomb" -- the estimated 186 billion tons of carbon stored in Canada's forests, which is equivalent to 27 years worth of global carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.LiNeBrEaK"There's only one thing which hauls all that carbon out of the forest, and that's logging," said Merran Smith, director of the climate program at the environmental group ForestEthics. "What we need to do is maintain as much biodiversity as we can, so we are prepared to adapt as temperatures change, so we have resilience."LiNeBrEaKBut Kurz and other government scientists contend that a logging moratorium is no solution to the global warming problem and would in fact increase carbon emissions over the long term.LiNeBrEaKThat's because, they argue, essential wood products for construction, furniture and other uses would have to be replaced with other man-made materials, such as plastic, steel or concrete, which require the burning of even more fossil fuels -- and therefore carbon emissions -- during their manufacturing process.LiNeBrEaK"It's not as simple as saying, 'Log less and therefore have more carbon sequestered in the forests,' " Kurz said. "That is true, but if in order to do that you have more fossil fuel emitted elsewhere, your impact on the climate may be negative."LiNeBrEaKInstead, some scientists argue for more extensive logging of the remaining commercial forests so that older forest stands, which are most vulnerable to insect infestations and have nearly reached their carbon-storage capacity, can be replanted with younger trees that will take in even more carbon during their growing years.LiNeBrEaKhwitt@tribune.com	FORESTS and WOODLANDS (93%); CLIMATE CHANGE (91%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); EXPERIMENTATION and RESEARCH (89%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (89%); RESEARCH (89%); TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (78%); TRENDS (77%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (77%); FORESTRY and ENVIRONMENT (77%); CARBON OFFSETS (75%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (73%); RESPIRATORY DISEASE (72%); CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (71%)  		CHICAGO, IL, USA (89%); VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA (73%) EARTH (92%); BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA (90%); ILLINOIS, USA (89%); ALBERTA, CANADA (58%) CANADA (98%); UNITED STATES (89%)  	January 3, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Chicago Tribune   	Howard Witt, Chicago Tribune  				Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	Forest Products  	20090102-TB-Canada-s-forests-once-huge-help-on-greenhouse-gases-now-contribute-to-climate-change-0102  	TB  														
Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 2, 2009 Friday 	Scientists say comet killed off mammoths, saber-toothed tigers: Earth's rebirth may have begun 13,000 years ago  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	759 words  	Jan. 2--First an explosion as powerful as thousands of megatons of TNT rained meteorites down on North America. Then forest fires broke out across the continent, sending up a thick layer of soot and dust that blocked out the sun. A sudden ice age ensued, and some of the Earth's largest animals went extinct in a blink of geological time.LiNeBrEaKIt's well-known that a meteorite colliding with Earth is considered the most likely reason why dinosaurs died off 65 million years ago. Now a team of scientists say it has found new evidence that a comet triggered a similar extinction much more recently: 13,000 years ago, when humans were around to witness the event and suffer its terrible consequences. LiNeBrEaKThe researchers also think that when the comet exploded above the planet's surface -- ultimately killing off mammoths, saber-toothed tigers and other large mammals that roamed North America -- Chicago wasn't far from ground zero.LiNeBrEaK"If you'd been in Chicago back in that time, it would've been one very bad day," said Allen West, an Arizona geophysicist and one of the authors of a paper appearing Friday in the journal Science.LiNeBrEaKThe scientists, led by University of Oregon anthropologist Douglas Kennett, say their report offers a "smoking bullet" -- proof that a comet set off the sudden 1,000-year freeze and wiped out the big animals of the era.LiNeBrEaKWorking at multiple sites across the continent, researchers found nanodiamonds -- microscopic particles thought to be found on comets -- in a 13,000-year-old layer of rich sedimentary soil called a "black mat." Beneath the layer with the nanodiamonds, fossils of the animals are abundant. After that layer, they disappear, West said.LiNeBrEaK"It's extraordinary that tens of millions of animals disappeared synchronously at exactly the time when the diamonds and carbon layer are laid down across the continent," said West, whose co-authors include DePaul University chemist Wendy Wolbach.LiNeBrEaKArrowheads and other artifacts from the Clovis culture of humans -- an early hunter-gatherer society -- also vanished after the black mat was laid down 13,000 years ago.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, West and a team of scientists published an analysis of black mats from several regions that found heavy metals, soot and charcoal suggestive of meteorite impacts and subsequent fires. The new report says the discovery of nanodiamonds in the same material is more evidence of a cosmic strike.LiNeBrEaKArcheologists have long speculated about whether climate change or over-hunting drove the mammoths, tigers and other "megafauna" to extinction and led to the decline of the Clovis culture.LiNeBrEaKMany remain skeptical of the comet theory and think there may be better explanations for what happened, said Daniel Amick, an associate professor of anthropology at Loyola University Chicago who studies the Clovis culture.LiNeBrEaK"When most archeologists heard about it they were somewhat dismissive," Amick said. "We would think, 'How in the world could we have missed this? How could this spectacular kind of event have occurred and never even dawned on us?' "LiNeBrEaKThe authors have much to prove before their theory is accepted, Amick said, like pinpointing the date of the event and ruling out other potential causes of extinction and climate change.LiNeBrEaKIn response to one common criticism of the comet theory -- that no craters have been found from an impact -- West said the comet may not have reached Earth, but exploded into fragments somewhere above the surface.LiNeBrEaKWhere exactly that might have happened is a mystery, but high concentrations of nanodiamonds at a site in eastern Michigan suggest the Great Lakes as a possibility.LiNeBrEaK"We think that Chicago might well have been very near ground zero," West said.LiNeBrEaKThe idea that a comet may have caused catastrophic climate change and extinction relatively recently in Earth's long history suggests scientists shouldn't dismiss the possibility of it happening again, Wolbach said.LiNeBrEaK"Should we be doing more to try to deflect future asteroids, or is that too sci-fi?" she said. "If this is true and there was an impact 12. 9 thousand years ago, obviously this is not something that's just a theoretical idea, it's a real thing."LiNeBrEaKrmitchum@tribune.com	RESEARCH REPORTS (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); MAMMALS (90%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (89%); EXPLOSIVES (89%); HUMANITIES and SOCIAL SCIENCE (89%); PLANETS and ASTEROIDS (89%); RESEARCH (89%); ANTHROPOLOGY and ARCHAEOLOGY (89%); FOREST FIRES (78%); FIRES (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); EVIDENCE (75%); CHEMISTRY (75%); PHYSICS (75%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (65%); HEAVY METALS and TOXIC MINERALS (63%); ARCHAEOLOGY (60%)  		CHICAGO, IL, USA (91%) EARTH (94%); ILLINOIS, USA (91%) NORTH AMERICA (93%); UNITED STATES (91%)  	January 3, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Chicago Tribune   	Robert Mitchum, Chicago Tribune  	UNIVERSITY OF OREGON (55%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	Construction  	20090102-TB-Scientists-say-comet-killed-off-mammoths-saber-toothed-tigers-0102  	TB

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 2, 2009 Friday 	Solar power industry remains hot in California  	ENVIRONMENT; News; Business  	1062 words  	Despite the turbulent economy, or perhaps because of it, solar energy remains a growth industry in California.LiNeBrEaKThe amount of electricity generated in the state by solar energy soared in 2008, and applications for rebates under the state's Million Solar Roofs program reached record levels in the last five months of the year.LiNeBrEaK"While we don't have the final numbers yet, it appears we nearly doubled the amount of solar installed in 2008 vs. 2007," said Molly Tirpak Sterkel, director of the California Solar Initiative. "That's a magnificent story." LiNeBrEaKExperts attribute the surge in solar sales to a big increase in the federal tax credit, an ongoing state rebate and new innovative financing programs, as well as to mounting consumer concerns over global warming. The growth comes despite a U.S. economy suffering from a battered stock market, severe declines in house and car sales, and growing unemployment.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps 150 megawatts or more of new solar panels were installed in California in 2008, Sterkel said, up from 81 megawatts in 2007. (In California, one megawatt is enough electricity for 750 houses.)LiNeBrEaKShe noted that California has more than half of the solar capacity in the United States, and that the state ranks as the world's No. 4 solar entity after Germany, Spain and Japan.LiNeBrEaKSolar's growth here is "somewhat surprising, as we expected the economic downtown might have some dampening effect," said Damon Franz, an energy analyst with the California Public Utilities Commission.LiNeBrEaKSales increased because consumers now see solar as a safe economic bet, and a hedge against rising energy prices, said Lyndon Rive, chief executive of Solar City, a solar installer based in Foster City.LiNeBrEaKOthers credit inaction, then action, by the U.S. Congress for boosting solar. Fears that Congress wouldn't extend the federal solar tax credit past the end of 2008 spurred activity in the early fall as consumers and installers rushed to get projects completed by the end of the year. Then once Congress extended the tax credit for eight years and lifted a $2,000 cap in favor of a 30 percent credit, consumers jumped in to be first in line to get their systems   and their credit   after Jan. 1.LiNeBrEaKCombined, the federal tax credit and the California incentives can reduce the cost of a residential solar system, which typically costs $25,000 to $35,000, by as much as $14,000.LiNeBrEaKIn the 24-month history of the California Solar Initiative, the busiest five months for applications were August through December of 2008. More than 1,000 applications were received in August, the largest monthly number to that point in the program's history, and the number reached a record 1,316 in December.LiNeBrEaKThe California Solar Initiative is run regionally by public utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric has collected many more applications than Southern California Edison, which serves the greater Los Angeles area, or the California Center for Sustainable Energy, which runs the program in the San Diego area.LiNeBrEaKThrough Dec. 31, applications in PGandE's Northern and Central California territory represented 52 of the 79 megawatts for residential systems and 118 of 219 megawatts for nonresidential systems.LiNeBrEaKChuck Hornbrook, PGandE's senior manager for solar and customer generation, expects the utility to connect more than 1,000 solar systems to the grid in January.LiNeBrEaKMany of those will be customers who had put off making the connection in order to get the larger federal tax credit, he said.LiNeBrEaK"There's a big momentum," Hornbrook said.LiNeBrEaKStatewide, 18,199 homeowners or businesses have applied for rebates on 298 megawatts worth of solar panels since the program started in January 2007. The goal of the California Solar Initiative is to have 3,000 megawatts of solar power installed by 2016, and $3. 3 billion have been allocated to three programs to reach that goal.LiNeBrEaKOn Friday, 1 Block Off the Grid, a San Francisco startup that negotiates communitywide discounts for solar projects, said it had selected Solar City for its next round of Bay Area installations, which includes San Jose.LiNeBrEaKWhile its original goal was to put solar on 75 homes, Dave Llorens, 1BOG's general manager, said the company already has 667 people who have signed up to have their homes evaluated.LiNeBrEaKSuch communitywide efforts, Llorens said, push down solar prices while providing homeowners with a well-vetted installer and a pre-negotiated deal.LiNeBrEaK"It's the magic of knowing everyone else is getting the same deal," Llorens said.LiNeBrEaKFor Solar City, working with 1BOG means it doesn't have to spend as much on advertising and sales calls to attract new customers. So it can offer discounted rates, Rive said.LiNeBrEaK1BOG was acquired by another San Francisco startup, Virgance, in November, which has expanded the solar-buying cooperative to 20 cities nationwide, including San Jose.LiNeBrEaKIn San Jose's Blossom Valley neighborhood, Fiona Marshall has signed up to get a solar system via 1 Block Off the Grid. "They've done all the legwork," she said, adding that was important because she and husband Tim just had a new baby.LiNeBrEaKIt was the change in the federal tax credit that spurred their decision.LiNeBrEaK"Now we can have a solar system and not have to wait 20 years to break even," she said.LiNeBrEaKContact Matt Nauman at (408) 920-5701 or at mnauman@mercurynews.com.SOLAR INCENTIVESLiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKFederal: In late 2008, Congress extended the federal tax credit for solar systems by eight years, and waived a $2,000 tax cap in favor of a 30 percent tax credit. For most consumers, this makes putting a solar photovoltaic system on their roof thousands of dollars cheaper. State: Incentives from the California Solar Initiative decline as the number of installed megawatts grows. Its residential incentives began at $2. 50 a watt and have dropped several times since. Customers scrambled to get the $1. 90-a- per watt rate before it fell to $1. 55 a watt on Dec. 1. Other incentive programs are available for new homes, low-income housing and nonresidential systems. San Jose: This past summer, Mayor Chuck Reed challenged local solar installers to offer systems to city residents that required no money down. Several companies responded, including Horizon Energy Systems, Petersen Dean Roofing, Power Solutions, REC Solar, Regrid Power, Solar City, StablSolar and SunPower. But the city never endorsed any of the installers and, unlike San Francisco and Berkeley, never offered financial incentives for residents.

The Dallas Morning News (Texas)  	January 2, 2009 Friday 	Energy Future Holdings' Evans looking to expand carbon discussions  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	732 words  	Jan. 2--Energy Future Holdings chairman Don Evans has seen a shift in China's attitude toward the environment.LiNeBrEaKThe Chinese have begun talking seriously about the environment, not just about their growing economy, Evans said recently.LiNeBrEaK"Up until a couple of years ago, what they always wanted to talk about was economic growth: How do we grow this economy? And we need to create 25 million jobs," said Evans, who made his first trip to China as commerce secretary in 2002. LiNeBrEaK"In the last couple of years, as much time -- if not more time -- is spent talking about the environment," said the former Midland oilman and close friend of President George W. Bush.LiNeBrEaKIn early December, Evans signed EFH up for the Treasury Department's EcoPartnership program. The program pairs Chinese and U.S. companies to share information about business and operational practices.LiNeBrEaKThe Dallas utility was assigned to China Huadian Corp., a massive power company that operates coal-fired power plants.LiNeBrEaKEFH hasn't decided exactly what it will discuss or how much it will spend on the program.LiNeBrEaKEvans expects the companies will meet a couple of times a year and will probably discuss technology to burn coal more cleanly.LiNeBrEaKBoth companies are studying building new technology plants -- called integrated gasification combined cycle power plants -- that are designed to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions.LiNeBrEaK"They're advancing an IGCC project, trying to get government support for that," Evans said. "If they get it, that may put them out in front of us in terms of building an IGCC plant. We'll be able to learn from that."LiNeBrEaKEFH, formerly TXU Corp., is building three traditional coal-fired power plants. The company has said it is considering IGCC but hasn't offered any plans.LiNeBrEaKSuch technology could become important for EFH if Congress limits the amount of carbon dioxide that power companies may emit.LiNeBrEaKEvans agrees with most energy executives that regulations are coming.LiNeBrEaKAs commerce secretary, Evans found himself in charge of an organization that spent billions of dollars a year researching climate change, since the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fell into his department.LiNeBrEaK"I got exposed to a lot of the challenges we face with climate change and dealing with many of the scientists. I'm not going to tell you that the science is absolute yet," he said.LiNeBrEaK"But is there reason to be focused on it and study it and think about it and respond to it? Yes. Should we put some kind of system in place that deals with carbon? Yes," he said.LiNeBrEaKHe said he wants regulations that have an impact on the entire economy, rather than just one segment.LiNeBrEaKHis role in carbon dioxide discussions will be to make sure "that the policymakers have all the science and have all the information and have all the impact to the economy so there's clear thinking of the whole ... impact," he said.LiNeBrEaKPeople in both China and the U.S. need power that's not only clean but affordable, he said.LiNeBrEaKEvans' visits to China inspired a deep tenderness for the impoverished people there.LiNeBrEaKWhen he traveled to China a few weeks ago to sign the EcoPartnership, he also visited his friends: two blind teenagers who are studying acupuncture.LiNeBrEaKEvans met the boys on his first trip in 2002, after President Jiang Zemin urged him to visit the impoverished western part of the country. Evans then visited the 7- and 9-year-old boys in the two-room shack they shared with their parents.LiNeBrEaKEvans continued visiting the boys over the years and watching their lives improve as China's economy surged. Now the boys live in a larger house that's on a paved road, and they even have a cellphone, he said.LiNeBrEaKEvans beams when he talks about the their progress.LiNeBrEaK"They're actually learning how to be a masseuse and acupuncturist," he said.LiNeBrEaKBlind acupuncturists?LiNeBrEaK"Yeah, I'm having trouble with that one myself," he said. "When I was out there a couple or three weeks ago, [one of the boys] took me through some of his massage routines. Anyway, he's learned that pretty well."

The Daily Independent (Ashland, Kentucky)  	January 2, 2009 Friday 	Making those New Year's resolutions  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	592 words  	Jan. 2--ASHLAND -- New Year's resolutions are a tradition for many Americans, including many local residents.LiNeBrEaKThe Turner family of Sciotoville, Ohio say they make their resolutions as a family each year.LiNeBrEaK"We discuss it around the first of the year every year what we're going to do," said 39-year-old Charlotte Turner. This year, she said, the family has been discussing financial goals.LiNeBrEaKBill Turner, 48, said they have made a resolution to reduce their debt. "We just got other plans and need to take care of it," he said. LiNeBrEaKAndrew Turner, 10, has a slightly different resolution. "I want to keep on saving my money in the bank," he said.LiNeBrEaKBill Turner said he's made resolutions before with about a 50 percent success rate but he's confident he'll accomplish this year's. He gives this advice to others: "Keep the list small and try to stay on target."LiNeBrEaK"One thing at a time," added Angela Turner.LiNeBrEaKThe Turners said they have other expectations and hopes for the year, including seeing the Iraq War end and more troops being brought home safely.LiNeBrEaK"I think with our new president and their new government and their hope, I think we'll see a lot of that. I don't think we'll see all the troops home but I think we'll see a lot of them," Bill Turner said.LiNeBrEaKThomas Fout, of Portsmouth, Ohio is making his first New Year's resolution -- to lose weight.LiNeBrEaKFout said he was inspired by his wife's success with the same resolution last year. Misty Fout, 32, lost 70 pounds Thomas Fout, 38, said he hopes to have similar success and has resolved to lose about 40 pounds.LiNeBrEaKBut, he admits, he started earlier than yesterday. "Its an add on resolution because I've been in the process of losing weight already," he said.LiNeBrEaKThis year, he said, his wife has resolved to get a better education and is contemplating becoming a nurse. His advice for others with resolutions: "What ever you decide to do, stick with it."LiNeBrEaKThe couple said they also hope to see the economy improve in 2009.LiNeBrEaKGreater efforts to stop global warming, top the wish list of 15-year-old Bell Hannah, of South Shore.LiNeBrEaKShe said she routinely makes New Year's Resolutions including this year's to improve her golf game enough to win a state title.LiNeBrEaKHannah said to her making a goal and working toward it is more important than achieving the goal itself.LiNeBrEaK"It gives me inspiration," she said. "If you can't do it that's fine but its a really good goal."LiNeBrEaKHannah's friend, 18-year-old David Berry, of Greenup, had a similar opinion of resolutions.LiNeBrEaK"It gives me something to look forward too," he said. "It gives me pride in myself if I achieve what I wanted to do."LiNeBrEaKHowever, Berry said he abstained for making a resolution this year, which he declined to share, because he didn't think he would be successful.LiNeBrEaKThat's the reason Angela McCune, 28, of Greenup, hasn't made any either. "I just don't keep them," she said, "I just don't have any will power is what it is."LiNeBrEaKHer father, Bill McCune, 65, also of Greenup, is also not a resolution maker although he couldn't explain why. "I just don't make them normally," he said.

The Houston Chronicle (Texas)  	January 2, 2009 Friday 	Lending woes push alternative energy to back burner  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	953 words  	Jan. 2--Never mind the fall in oil prices. It's the credit crunch that has siphoned momentum from alternative and renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKAnalysts say many capital-intensive new projects or expansions of established ones are pretty much on ice until access to money loosens up.LiNeBrEaK"All of the factors that were pushing for more investment into the sector have disappeared: oil, gas, coal, and by extension, electricity prices, are lower. Money that is ready to go at risk on projects with unproven technology or management teams has dried up," said Jamie Webster, senior consultant in the gas and upstream group at Washington D.C.-based PFC Energy. LiNeBrEaKAnd Houston's Simmons and Company International said in a recent note to investors that its outlook for the solar sector is more cautious in the current financial climate, noting that the "credit contagion is having an even greater impact than we originally believed and is affecting a wider range of companies."LiNeBrEaKOil's rise over the last several years helped fuel billions of dollars in investment in alternatives and renewables, from startups to divisions in some of the world's largest oil majors. The higher crude went, the closer expensive alternatives came to profitability -- albeit with subsidies and tax breaks.LiNeBrEaKBut access to credit, particularly for ventures that require years of patience before providing returns on high startup costs, fueled the momentum more than record crude prices, said Joseph Stanislaw, a former economist at the Paris-based International Energy Agency and founder of the Boston-based energy advisory firm JA Stanislaw Group.LiNeBrEaKSeveral months into the credit crisis, the alternatives and renewables sector faces a difficult road ahead until banks, venture capitalists and private equity firms start lending and investing again.LiNeBrEaK"A lot of companies -- solar, wind or others -- found their credit lines were just cut. They need access to credit. A lot of these things aren't going to be economic tomorrow morning even if we have $140 oil," Stanislaw said.LiNeBrEaK"It's really a tossup right now. Everyone's on hold in the whole system to some degree," he said.LiNeBrEaKObama's planLiNeBrEaKBut the sector remains politically popular. President-elect Barack Obama touts a plan to invest $150 billion over a decade and create 5&acirc;[#x20ac][0/00]&acirc;[#x20ac][0/00]million jobs. He also favors a mechanism to cap greenhouse gas emissions and let polluters deal in permits to emit carbon dioxide, known as cap-and-trade.LiNeBrEaKAlso, clean-energy priorities are evident in Obama's chosen team to craft energy and environmental policy. That lineup includes his nomination of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu, who encouraged study on climate change and renewables as head of the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.LiNeBrEaKWebster said the squeeze on alternatives may ease if Obama can implement incentive packages, "but there is a high hurdle to turn many of these projects. Economic, and tax credits lose their allure and value when profits are harder to find to put it against."LiNeBrEaKStanislaw said optimism in developing alternatives and renewables in addition to fossil fuels is "fundamental and critical" as the new administration moves in.LiNeBrEaK"This is going to be what I'd call a policy-driven marketplace," he said. "We're talking about big sums of money to jump-start the economy, and a lot of that can be spent on green jobs."LiNeBrEaKInevitability of greenLiNeBrEaKBut as the sector weathers the credit storm, research should continue amid the slowdown in startups.LiNeBrEaK"A lot of these companies are still doing their work -- although they're struggling," Stanislaw said.LiNeBrEaKA recent Merrill Lynch report said "cleantech" -- including solar, wind, geothermal and biofuels -- appears inevitable given the Paris-based International Energy Agency's forecast that the equivalent of four new Saudi Arabias must come on line by 2030 "just to offset expected declines in oil production from current fields."LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that renewables will fuel 12. 5&acirc;[#x20ac][0/00]&acirc;[#x20ac][0/00]percent of all U.S. electricity generation by 2030, up from 8. 4 percent in 2007.

The Houston Chronicle 	January 2, 2009 Friday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Rocket science;  Jet test should spark quest for new biofuels. 	B; Pg. 8  	488 words  	AN Air New Zealand jet thundered through the sky on a two-hour flight this week - on a 50-50 blend of ordinary fuel and one made of seeds from the African desert. LiNeBrEaKThe successful flight was promising for the airline industry, and truly exciting for the environment and the hope for national fuel autonomy.LiNeBrEaKTuesday's test was the first commercial air flight to use fuel from the jatropha weed. It performed "well through both the fuel system and engine," Air New Zealand's chief pilot told the BBC.LiNeBrEaKThe flight lasted more than twice as long as the first flight using biofuel, performed by Virgin Atlantic in February 2008. That plane used a 20-percent mixture of coconut oil and babassu oil in one of four engines.LiNeBrEaKBut jatropha, unlike coconut or corn, sidesteps several problems now linked to biofuels.LiNeBrEaKCombined with pressures such as high gas prices, production of corn-based ethanol helped aggravate global food shortages last year.LiNeBrEaKUsing food for fuel also harms the environment. Several European governments recently ended subsidies for palm oil diesel production. Their Asian suppliers, cutting rainforests to grow the palms, were actually boosting overall atmospheric carbons.LiNeBrEaKFinally, most food crops use great swaths of land and heavy fertilizer. Runoff from ethanol production has already compromised parts of the Mississippi River.LiNeBrEaKJatropha, by contrast, is a sturdy weed that thrives in arid, low-producing land in India, Malawi and Mozambique. The oil in Air New Zealand's Rolls Royce engines came from environmentally sustainable farms.LiNeBrEaKIt's also efficient: Each seed produces between 30 and 40 percent of its mass in oil.LiNeBrEaKNo one expects jatropha to replace jet fuel, in part because it lacks the important hydrocarbon rings that help seal jet engines in flight.LiNeBrEaKBut the humble seed oil does reflect the exciting quest for new biofuels - energy that can reduce the need for petroleum with less environmental stress and more bang for the production buck.LiNeBrEaKThis is key for the airline industry; its emissions produce only 3 percent of greenhouse gas but do more damage at high altitudes.LiNeBrEaKIn the long run, however, Tuesday's flight over Auckland is even more meaningful for combating climate change from the ground.LiNeBrEaKJatropha, noted Jim Marston of the Environmental Defense Fund, shows the rewards of investing in new, clean energy sources. "Yes, yes, yes, yes," Marston said, of the possibility of jatropha being refined one day for car engines. To encourage such breakthroughs, the federal government should accelerate research into new and efficient alternatives.LiNeBrEaKTexas should be leading this research. Already, the University of Texas is developing algae as a fuel source. And Continental Airlines is set to test an algae-and-jatropha fueled flight on Jan. 7.LiNeBrEaKOne century ago, Texas oil helped determine how the whole world would travel by land and air. Texas' creativity should now drive the fuel alternatives for the new millennium.

The Monitor (McAllen, Texas)  	January 2, 2009 Friday 	Lack of a national climate policy is nothing to sneeze at  	COMMENTARY  	876 words  	According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5 percent to 20 percent of the U.S. population gets the flu each year. Of those, about 200,000 people require hospitalization and 36,000 ultimately die. But imagine if, in addition to the stresses of cold and flu season, American health providers were annually confronted with widespread outbreaks of malaria or a host of other diseases that could spread into the United States due to global warming.LiNeBrEaKIf this sounds like a scenario from a Hollywood thriller, think again. LiNeBrEaKAccording to a growing body of research, the threat of global warming bringing new diseases to America's shores is one that U.S. policy-makers need to take seriously. As the world warms, diseases are spreading farther, heat waves are lasting longer and air quality is declining. In 2005, the World Health Organization stated that the effects of climate change might have caused more than 150,000 deaths in the year 2000, and unless action were taken soon, succeeding years would likely fare worse. Indeed, a report released this December at a conference of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene warned that changing climates, when combined with international air travel, could help spread the scourge of malaria to areas in the United States and Europe that have historically remained untouched.LiNeBrEaKEvery outbreak of disease, or weather phenomena with adverse implications for human health _ such as smog _ has multiple causes.LiNeBrEaKWe can never say any isolated event stems solely from global warming.LiNeBrEaKBut using that as an excuse for inaction misses the larger point. Many public health threats are closely tied to the climate, and the hotter it is, the more likely these threats become. Global warming pollution, therefore, is stacking the deck against our own health.LiNeBrEaKSmog, for instance, is caused by the interaction between air pollutants, sunlight and heat. The United States regulates those pollutants leading to smog, but currently does not directly control the emissions that cause global warming. This ignores a key part of the problem, as rising temperatures are projected to increase U.S. smog-related deaths 4. 5 percent by mid-century, with a corresponding jump in asthma attacks, lung damage and cardiac arrest.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming is not just an abstract concern about wildlife at the world's poles. It's also a problem that hits close to home, and health professionals already see warning signs. In an issue devoted largely to global warming, the Journal of the American Medical Association urged, "It is not too late and none too soon for the health care community to advocate policies that wean us from fossil fuels and ultimately mitigate the extent of human-induced climate change."LiNeBrEaKThe spread of malaria poses one such problem. According to the WHO, in some countries with a heavy malaria burden the disease can account for as much as 40 percent of public health expenditures. This includes a combination of health care costs imposed both on the public (such as through the need for new infrastructure to handle increased medical demands) and directly on individuals and families (through increased personal expenditures on items such as antimalarial drugs).LiNeBrEaKWith the U.S. health-care system already under tremendous pressure, the additional challenge of global warming is one that our health-care providers can scarcely afford. Earlier this summer, the Environmental Protection Agency released the most comprehensive analysis to date on the U.S. health problems caused by global warming. That report, which compiled research from dozens of previous studies, found it "very likely" that heat-related morbidity and mortality would increase in the decades ahead, with broad impacts spanning every region of the country.LiNeBrEaKNevertheless, even with its latest report in hand, the agency has yet to officially declare whether or not greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health. While the EPA should get some credit for sounding an alarm, the agency hasn't provided any significant steps to address America's unrestrained carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKWhile relaxation in a warmer climate was historically prescribed for colds and a wide range of other ailments, global warming is nobody's cure. The health reports on climate change, from the EPA, CDC and WHO, should provide the stimulus for the next Congress and the Obama administration to enact binding, science-based limits on the emissions that cause global warming.LiNeBrEaKABOUT THE WRITERLiNeBrEaKPhyllis Cuttino is the director of the domestic global warming campaign for the Pew Environment Group.

The New York Times 	January 2, 2009 Friday   Late Edition - Final	Scientists Link Diamonds to Quick Cooling Eons Ago  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 13  	822 words  	At least once in Earth's history, global warming ended quickly, and scientists have long wondered why.LiNeBrEaK  Now researchers are reporting that the abrupt cooling -- which took place about 12,900 years ago, just as the planet was emerging from an ice age -- may have been caused by one or more meteors that slammed into North America.LiNeBrEaK  That could explain the extinction of mammoths, saber-tooth tigers and maybe even the first human inhabitants of the Americas, the scientists report in Friday's issue of the journal Science. LiNeBrEaK  The hypothesis has been regarded skeptically, but its advocates now report perhaps more convincing residue of impact: a thin layer of microscopic diamonds found in rocks across America and in Europe. LiNeBrEaK  ''We're up over 30 sites, as far west as offshore California, as far east as Germany,'' said Allen West, a retired geology consultant who is one of the scientists working on the research. LiNeBrEaK  The meteors would have been smaller than the six-mile-wide meteor that struck the Yucatan peninsula 65 million years ago and led to the mass extinctions of the dinosaurs. The killing effects of the hypothesized bombardment 12,900 years ago would have been more subtle.LiNeBrEaK  Climatologists believe that the direct cause of the 1,300-year cold spell, known as the Younger Dryas, was a sudden rush of fresh water from a giant lake in central Canada to the North Atlantic. LiNeBrEaK  Usually a surface current of warm water flows northward in the Atlantic toward Greenland and Europe, then cools and sinks, returning south in the deep ocean. But the fresh water, which is less dense, blocked the sinking of the cold, salty water in the North Atlantic, disrupting the currents.LiNeBrEaK  That sudden change in plumbing has long been known, but what caused it has never been satisfactorily explained.LiNeBrEaK  The authors of the paper in Science say it was meteors.LiNeBrEaK  At each site the scientists looked at, the diamond layer in the rocks correlates to the date of the hypothesized impact. Within the layer, the scientists report finding a multitude of diamond particles, all encased within carbon spheres. ''We've yet to find a single diamond above it,'' Dr. West said. ''We've yet to find a single diamond below it.'' LiNeBrEaK  Perhaps more telling, the scientists reported last month at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, the carbon atoms inside some of the diamonds are lined up in a hexagonal crystal pattern instead of the usual cubic structure. The hexagonal diamonds, formed by extraordinary heat and pressure, have been found only at impact craters and within meteorites and cannot be formed in forest fires or volcanic eruptions, Dr. West said.LiNeBrEaK  Last year the scientists presented other evidence of an impact, including elevated levels of the element iridium.LiNeBrEaK  At least some skeptics are not convinced. ''The whole thing still does not make sense, and there are lots of contradictions,'' said Christian Koeberl, a professor of geological sciences at the University of Vienna in Austria.LiNeBrEaK  His chief reservation is that there is no crater. ''A body of this size does not just blow up without a trace in the atmosphere,'' Dr. Koeberl said. ''Physics won't have it.''LiNeBrEaK  Proponents have suggested that the meteor hit an ice sheet a couple of miles thick or that there was a series of smaller objects that exploded in the air. But Dr. Koeberl said something hitting an ice sheet would still generate a hole in the ground underneath, and he questioned whether smaller impacts or air explosions would produce the shock waves needed to make diamonds.LiNeBrEaK  An impact should also have left remnants of melted rocks and shocked minerals, Dr. Koeberl said.LiNeBrEaK  But if true, the hypothesis could explain the disappearance of ice age mammals like mammoths and argue against the alternative idea that the animals were hunted to extinction by humans.LiNeBrEaK  It might also help explain the disappearance of the Clovis people, a culture named after a distinctive arrow point discovered in a mammoth skeleton in Clovis, N.M., who are believed to have arrived in the Americas more than 13,000 years ago.LiNeBrEaK  Douglas J. Kennett, a University of Oregon archaeologist who is the lead author of the Science paper, said no Clovis points or bones of the extinct animals had been found above the diamond layer. ''It seems those two things synchronously end,'' he said.LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Kennett said there also appeared to be a gap of several centuries between the disappearance of the Clovis and the resettlement by other people.LiNeBrEaK  Gary Huss, a scientist at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, who was one of the early reviewers of the paper in Science, said though the scientists had not proved their case, they had offered enough evidence that the idea warranted a closer look by others.LiNeBrEaK  ''They have a hypothesis that explains several things that hard to explain any other way,'' Dr. Huss said. ''Diamonds are less convincing by themselves, but they strengthen their case considerably.''

The New York Times 	January 2, 2009 Friday   Late Edition - Final	When the Call of the Wild Is Nothing but the Phone in Your Pocket  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 11  	486 words  	Remember when cellphone ring tones mostly advertised personal musical tastes (Beyonce, Metallica, ''The 1812 Overture'') or parental pride (babies cooing)? The chance to make political statements with this seemingly omnipresent  speaker system went largely unexploited. But that was before endangered-species ring tones were born.  LiNeBrEaK  Now, from Siberia to the ski slopes of the French Alps, from Manitoba to Brazil, tens of thousands of phones howl, hoot, trill, screech, croak or emit the haunting song of whales.LiNeBrEaK  The Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group based in Arizona known more for litigating on behalf of endangered creatures than building a choral repertoire around them, introduced the ring tones in 2006 and has been counting downloads the way Billboard counts album sales. The new tally: 200,000, a milestone of sorts. (They are most popular, after the United States and Britain,  in China and Iran.)LiNeBrEaK  Bumper stickers produce instant reactions, pro and con, said Peter Galvin, the center's conservation director. But with wildlife sounds, Mr. Galvin  added, ''people don't already have their filters on for how they receive that information.''LiNeBrEaK  ''It's powerful,'' he continued. ''Any kind of music or sound influences people and how people think.'' LiNeBrEaK  Renditions of frogs and owls consumed researchers in the early days. But the list of more than 80 sounds has expanded to include animals that, though not yet endangered, can belt it out with the best of them, like the pika, a rodent dwelling in the Southwestern mountains in the United States, whose cool climes are threatened by climate change. The killer whale and the Mexican gray wolf, both endangered, are currently Nos. 1 and 2 on the charts. LiNeBrEaK  The more endangered a bird or beast, the harder to record it. Jon Slaght, a Ph.D. candidate in wildlife conservation at the University of Minnesota, spent days slogging recording gear around the Russian Far East, in minus-30-degree weather, to get not just the hoot of the world's largest owl -- the Blakiston's  fish owl -- but also the far less melodious cry of its offspring. It is this juvenile call that now summons Mr. Slaght to the phone.LiNeBrEaK  ''It's a little embarrassing when I'm in a public place,'' he said. ''It's a really grating, unpleasant noise.'' But, he added, ''it does get you to answer your phone.''LiNeBrEaK  It is incumbent upon downloaders to remember what they downloaded. Grace Matthews, a 19-year-old biology student at the University of Birmingham in England, took a skiing holiday last week in the French Alps. At one point, she skied away from her companions and into a snowy, dusky forest area. Alone, moving at a good clip on the steep slopes, she was startled by the howl of a wolf.LiNeBrEaK  ''I very nearly crashed,'' Ms. Matthews said in an interview.LiNeBrEaK  In a separate e-mail message, she added, ''It took me several long moments to realize I was being phoned, and not hunted.''

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Pennsylvania)  	January 2, 2009 Friday 	EDITORIAL: More U.N. hot air: Taking us for fools  	COMMENTARY  	348 words  	Jan. 2--On the heels of the United Nations' highly touted annual conference on climate change -- which effectively accomplished nothing -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has declared 2009 as "the year of climate change." LiNeBrEaKThe heat is on to cobble together, in one year, a comprehensive, industry-crippling, science-stunted climate treaty in Copenhagen.LiNeBrEaK"We have no time to waste," says Mr. Ban. Any new treaty to replace the confounding Kyoto Protocol -- which, thankfully, the United States didn't sign -- must be "balanced, comprehensive and ratifiable by all nations."LiNeBrEaKThere's the rub.LiNeBrEaKIt was argued at the recently completed Poland climate conference that poor countries should either be allowed to use cheap, carbon-based energy or that rich countries pay for expensive low-carbon energy technologies in these nations.LiNeBrEaKHow much?LiNeBrEaKOh, up to $80 billion annually into a "climate-adaptation fund," writes Ronald Bailey, Reason magazine's science correspondent.LiNeBrEaKEven older than the junk science of climate change and the controvertible "evidence" of man-made influences is the historically documented failure of foreign aid.LiNeBrEaKNew energy "technologies" for corrupt autocracies? That portends to be an even bigger fraud than the U.N. oil-for-food scandal in Iraq.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama's so-called energy and climate "Green Team" would be wise not to rush into a new climate accord that's shaping up to be even more outlandish than the old one.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, the United States would serve the globe far better by becoming the world leader of the Buncombe Brigade and dedicating itself to exposing the man-made global warming charade for what it is.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	January 2, 2009 Friday   SOONER EDITION	There is no reasonable doubt on global warming  	EDITORIAL; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR; Pg. B-4  	233 words  	In the Dec. 29 letters, Gary W. Trout made another attempt to sow doubt about the facts that the Earth's atmosphere and oceans are warming and also tried to link this view to the "radical left" ("Climate Gospel?"). He is wrong to doubt what has been confirmed by scientific investigations and wrong to attribute the science to the left. LiNeBrEaKI am nowhere near the extreme left of the political spectrum and neither is James Hansen, possibly the leading climate scientist in the world. We follow the methods of theory building and checks against data that have long been central to scientific methodology.LiNeBrEaKThe findings after decades of study have been remarkably consistent.LiNeBrEaKWe know that the Earth system is storing more energy.LiNeBrEaKWe know that greenhouse gases are involved in this.LiNeBrEaKWe know from looking at carbon isotopes that the increases in greenhouse gases are mostly due to the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.LiNeBrEaKWe know that there are several feedbacks that make things worse than what would be expected from the gases sent into the atmosphere by human actions.LiNeBrEaKIn terms of basic science, the only real room for doubt is in the details of how much worse things are going to get over time. So far things have gotten worse just a bit faster than predicted by the models.LiNeBrEaKThe science is clear, and it's long past the time of reasonable doubt. It's now time to do something to keep things from getting worse.

Plain Dealer (Cleveland) 	January 2, 2009 Friday   Final Edition; All Editions	A bright spot for consumers;  Gas, heating costs expected to stay low for now 	BUSINESS; Pg. B6  	1668 words  	ECONOMIC FORECAST 2009LiNeBrEaKFalling gasoline prices are every consumer's dream come true.LiNeBrEaKAfter the nightmare of $4 pump prices in 2008, it would be tempting to sleep through the next few months with images of buck-a-gallon gasoline dancing in our heads.LiNeBrEaKBut it wouldn't be wise. Today's or next week's or even next month's price at the pump doesn't begin to tell the story of what's ahead for energy.LiNeBrEaKThe global recession and global warming - and what government does about them - will affect the price of every form of energy you buy in 2009 and into the future.LiNeBrEaKAnd in Ohio there are additional issues that could spike power prices, making the state even less competitive, and new mandates that probably will make consumers even more conscious of energy prices. LiNeBrEaKHere are the scenarios, nightmarish and otherwise.LiNeBrEaKThe continued economic slowdownLiNeBrEaKThe global economic slowdown burst the oil-price bubble months ago, sending speculators and institutional investors scrambling to unload commodity contracts - driving oil prices from a high of $147 per barrel last July to about $40 now.LiNeBrEaKEven the most optimistic economists see a weak global economy through the first half of 2009, no matter what governments do to bail out ailing industries or prop up spending.LiNeBrEaKThe continued slowdown means demand for oil and refinery products should remain weak, keeping prices down. Most analysts think the slow recovery will keep demand and oil prices in the basement for at least the first half of 2009.LiNeBrEaKCould gasoline prices drop below $1 per gallon in the next few weeks, as some analysts believe?LiNeBrEaKThat might happen in isolated areas, said Tom Kloza, senior analyst with the Oil Price Information Service in Wall, N.J., but it won't be the national average.LiNeBrEaKKloza sees national average prices between $1. 40 and $1. 60 for the next couple of months, then rising to the $2-to-$2. 35 range in the spring and early summer.LiNeBrEaKThe outlook for home heating using natural gas also is good for consumers. Wholesale natural gas prices have followed oil down into the basement, from more than $13 wholesale per 1,000 cubic feet last July to less than $6 now.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Department of Energy predicts that natural gas prices will stay where they are for 2009, a forecast some local gas producers glumly agree with.LiNeBrEaKThe low natural gas prices are driven only partly by the recession. New North American gas fields have bolstered supplies, and prices are not really affected by foreign gas, with very little imported for domestic use.LiNeBrEaKBut there are signs that the 2008 boom in production from new fields is slowing, said Christopher McGill, managing director of policy and analysis for the American Gas Association in Washington, D.C. Producers are cutting back on new drilling, he said, and there is talk in the industry of a 20 percent cutback in the coming months.LiNeBrEaKA drilling cutback won't cut off supply that quickly, countered James Halloran, energy analyst with National City Private Client Group.LiNeBrEaK"There are new wells just coming on," he said. "We'll see a fair amount of new gas in the first quarter. And the United States has more storage capacity than any other nation. You may see [foreign] gas coming in during the off-season. This will keep prices reasonably low until some time in 2010."LiNeBrEaKRenewable energy and global warmingLiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama is expected to include money to foster rapid growth in renewable technologies in his administration's $800 billion-plus economic stimulus program.LiNeBrEaKInfrastructure replacement also could include rebuilding and expanding the nation's high-voltage utility transmission lines, commonly called the "grid."LiNeBrEaKThough much of that may occur in the upper Midwest where wind turbine farms are planned, some federal funds could trickle into Ohio. The state's northern transmission corridor, where the 2004 blackout started, is a major crossroads badly in need of expansion.LiNeBrEaKEven with federal backing, the new lines probably would add to consumers' electric bills, just as wind and solar projects also may. Power generated by those technologies is much more expensive than conventional generation.LiNeBrEaKBut the fossil fuel vs. green equation could be turned on its head, as early as 2009. Power from coal-burning generators - about 88 percent of Ohio's power is made that way - could become prohibitively expensive if the utilities are forced to account for the carbon dioxide they spew.LiNeBrEaKDriven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, climate change is already under way, say a majority of climate scientists. Whether they are right or not, what's important is that lawmakers think they are.LiNeBrEaKLegislation aimed at combating global warming by putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions is expected in 2009, at least by the politically savvy advocates.LiNeBrEaK"We definitely do think this Congress will put a price on carbon," said Henry Henderson, Midwest project coordinator with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "But there are things that have to be addressed to bring the Midwest into it."LiNeBrEaKMidwestern senators such as Ohio's Sherrod Brown are not about to endorse carbon legislation that would make it even harder for regional manufacturers to compete globally, especially if industries in developing nations are not faced with similar restrictions.LiNeBrEaKBrown last summer voted against limiting debate on the energy bill when he was unable to get amendments into the bill protecting Midwestern industrial economies.LiNeBrEaKThe kind of legislation environmentalists advocate - and Democratic congressional leaders have been receptive to - would raise the price of every fossil fuel and ripple into the price of gasoline, natural gas, manufactured products and, of course, electricity generated by coal-fired power plants.LiNeBrEaKStaving off environmental catastrophe and reviving the economy can coincide, at least politically. For example, Brown and fellow Democrat Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan proposed legislation in early December to provide $50 billion in federal loans to Midwest manufacturers to help them move into the emerging green economy by making parts for renewable energy systems such as fuel cells, wind turbines and solar panels.LiNeBrEaKSpecial issues in this stateLiNeBrEaKThe greening of Ohio. Energy efficiency and power generated by renewable technologies such as wind and solar are the law in 2009. Under the terms of the state's new energy and utility law, 0. 25 percent of the power sold here must be produced by renewable sources. The benchmark increases annually through 2024, when it must be 12. 5 percent.LiNeBrEaKMeeting those standards could be more difficult than Ohio lawmakers imagined. "There may be problems raising the money" for expensive wind and solar projects across the nation, said National City's Halloran. "And low [fossil] energy prices will hamper efforts."LiNeBrEaKConsumers can expect to hear a lot about energy efficiency for the next couple of decades. Ohio's new energy law also requires that utilities decrease customer electrical use by 0. 3 percent in 2009 through energy efficiency measures. That efficiency benchmark increases incrementally to 22 percent by 2025.LiNeBrEaKAdditionally, peak demand - the highest demand on a utility's system, which typically occurs in the late afternoon on a hot summer day - must be decreased by 1 percent in 2009 and an additional 0. 75 percent annually until 2018, when lawmakers will take another look at it.LiNeBrEaKTo comply with the mandates, the state's electric utilities, including FirstEnergy, are gearing up to launch conservation programs that are likely to include rebates to homeowners buying new appliances and a voluntary program to allow the utility to remotely turn down consumer air conditioning when demand begins to peak.LiNeBrEaKRate war. Predicting how much you will pay for power in 2009 through 2011 is impossible because of a looming showdown between the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and FirstEnergy Corp. The coming brawl over which of them has the final say on what you pay for power could end up in court - with current rates frozen in place while the fight drags on.LiNeBrEaKHad FirstEnergy accepted the haircut the PUCO wanted to give its regulated rates a week before Christmas, your bill would have stayed the same or even decreased slightly in 2009.LiNeBrEaKBut the company's rejection last week - and signal that it would prefer to base retail prices on volatile wholesale rates - could ultimately significantly increase consumer costs because they would be out of state control. In the short run, wholesale market prices are lower, again due to the recession.LiNeBrEaKNatural gas delivery. Gas utilities could become delivery-only companies. Dominion East Ohio gas company wants to stop selling natural gas, and the PUCO has agreed to the utility's plan to spin off customers who stubbornly insist on buying from the company instead of independent companies, which are unregulated.LiNeBrEaKIt's deregulation to the nth degree: In February, Dominion will host an auction for future gas supplies. The auction will set the amount that Dominion will add to the monthly commodity price of natural gas to establish a retail price.LiNeBrEaKThat's no different from what Dominion has done since 2006. But the February auction will include one additional detail: The customers themselves will be randomly sorted into groups and assigned to the winning bidders.LiNeBrEaKThe 265,000 customers who today are still buying from Dominion will wake up in April to see that one of the gas suppliers that won the auction is providing their gas. No matter which supplier, though, the price will be the same, the price set by the auction. Customers will be free to switch to another marketer, but they won't be able to go back to Dominion. You can expect a marketing blitz soon.LiNeBrEaKTo reach this Plain Dealer reporter: jfunk@plaind.com, 216-999-4138LiNeBrEaKABOUT THIS SERIES: The new year brings more gloomy forecasts but also fresh hope.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	January 2, 2009 Friday   All Editions	Our wishes for 2009;  Challenges from Washington to Wallington 	OPINION; Pg. A16  	550 words  	WHAT WILL the new year bring? We have a wish list that extends from Washington, D.C., through Trenton to North Jersey.LiNeBrEaKIn less than three weeks, Barack Obama will be sworn in as president of the United States. The challenges he faces are daunting. First and foremost is the economy, which must be stabilized and the crisis eased. Next, the resolution of the war in Iraq, the lack of progress in Afghanistan and the deteriorating situation in the Middle East must all be addressed quickly. LiNeBrEaKThe first steps must also be taken to expand access to health insurance, beginning with more coverage for the nation's uninsured children, and to make the environment, clean energy and combating global warming far higher priorities than they have been for almost a decade.LiNeBrEaKBut that's not all. Obama must also undo the grave damage done by his predecessor even as he begins to advance a new agenda.LiNeBrEaKThe secrecy, the torture, the abuse of civil liberties, the contempt for our three co-equal branches of government that characterized the Bush administration all must end. The nation's reputation abroad as a beacon of freedom and justice must be restored.LiNeBrEaKWe understand there are limits to how much one president can do to make things better and how much he can do in his first year. But we have just witnessed how much one president can do to make things far worse over eight years.LiNeBrEaKThe nation looks forward to the new president's leadership and a promising beginning in 2009 for the changes he pledged.LiNeBrEaKSpeaking of leadership, New Jersey faces both a gubernatorial and legislative elections this year. Governor Corzine will ask the voters to judge him on his four years in office and how he has fulfilled his promise to get the state's finances in order. Difficult as it was, that task has been even more complicated by the nation's economic crisis and the toll it has taken on state revenues and investments.LiNeBrEaKWhoever challenges him, former U.S. Attorney Christopher Christie or another Republican, will focus on the state's shaky economy, state spending, high property taxes and the sleazy track record of the governor's political party when it comes to corruption. The race for governor should be fair, smart and substantive.LiNeBrEaKWe also look forward to higher ethical standards for New Jersey public officials in 2009. The state needs qualified challengers and energized incumbents who realize voters want honesty and ability in their lawmakers. All New Jerseyans would like to believe the days of clubby, greedy insiders running the Legislature by way of backroom deals are over.LiNeBrEaKIn North Jersey, there should be new energy in Bergen County's Republican Party and new political leadership in the county Democratic Party. The indictments in Bergenfield over the forging of Democratic committee signatures and the federal corruption charges against the county's party chairman are all the evidence that Democrats need to know that it is time to start over and build a new, untainted organization.LiNeBrEaKFinally, in 2009, worries about paying the mortgage, keeping a job and putting food on the table should not mean the end of generosity and compassion for others.LiNeBrEaKIf the coming year requires all of us to be more frugal, if we cannot always open our wallets to help those in need, then at least we can open our arms and our hearts.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia)  	January 2, 2009 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Scientists disagree on climate change: They agree it is happening but forecast effects from bad to worse.  	COMMENTARY  	406 words  	Jan. 2--It might surprise many Americans to learn that there is a U.S. Climate Change Science Program. The Bush administration has shown little fidelity to science, much less an open mind about the dangers of climate change. Nevertheless, the program exists, and it is pessimistic about the future. LiNeBrEaKThe researchers, led by the U.S. Geological Society, quietly released their findings in the days leading up to the holidays. Their predictions for the 21st century differ from other prominent findings such as those of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.LiNeBrEaKLooking at the available data, the U.S. scientists concluded sea levels will rise faster than had been previously predicted, droughts could be worse in the United States, methane released from the seabed and permafrost probably will not be too bad, and the Atlantic Ocean's circulation of warm water should be safe.LiNeBrEaKSome might look at the different findings as cause for more skepticism. "See," they will say, "even the scientists can't agree on what will happen."LiNeBrEaKThey would be right, as far as they go. Scientists do not agree on the details. Figuring out what the climate will be like in 100 years is a complex undertaking. Tweak a few variables and the results can change radically.LiNeBrEaKYet those differences lie in the specific effects of climate change. The scientific community is in broad agreement that increasing levels of human-generated greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are causing the planet to warm. They agree, too, that nations must act soon to prevent the worst results, if there is even time left.LiNeBrEaKIt is like when people catch the flu. Doctors can easily diagnose the disease, but they cannot easily predict which symptoms someone will have. One patient might vomit, while another experiences only mild nausea. One might sneeze uncontrollably, while another coughs.LiNeBrEaKIn the same way, the planet is sick, and scientists forecast a range of possible effects. America can wait for the symptoms to manifest or it can work to remove the cause now.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 	January 2, 2009 Friday   Metro Edition	WORRIES ABOUT THE FUTURE STILL HAUNT  	EDITORIAL; Pg. B7  	612 words  	Having arrived at an age when the end is close enough that few events will have an extraordinary effect on my lifestyle (i.e., global warming, gay marriage, Iraq, al-Qaida), it remains a mystery why political and social controversies continue to haunt my conscience. At 82, having endured the idiocies of mankind -- mine included -- I should have arrived at a state of cynicism, or at least stoicism.LiNeBrEaKI can only guess why, instead of having evolved into a sardonic, I-don't-give-a-damn phase, I'm beset by a condition aptly penned by H.L. Mencken: "I believe in only one thing: liberty; but I do not believe in liberty enough to want to force it upon anyone." And, "It is inaccurate to say that I hate everything. I am strongly in favor of common sense, common honesty and common decency." LiNeBrEaKIt's Mencken's former quote that roils the gonads; that keeps me from throwing in the towel. My temperature soars whenever I hear of, or witness, the tampering of one's legal rights, either by government or by individuals. Amendment I of the Constitution empowers us to attack another's beliefs and actions with virtual impunity, whereas my personal Amendment I allows me to attack only those whose concept of liberty demands that others follow their rules and believe their beliefs.LiNeBrEaKHuman nature relegates the average person to the category of "follower," freedom of creative thought being enigmatic to an overly busy, television-addicted population. Hence, we have a content, but not necessarily happy, populace, one unfamiliar with the joy inherent in the search for knowledge and new ideas.LiNeBrEaKIt is this lack of curiosity that guides the cerebrally lazy to the political talk show host, and not to dinner table discussions or, heaven forbid, the library.LiNeBrEaKEvery election cycle enforces the maxim "we believe what we want to believe" even when facts run counter to our convictions. As an example, gun owners, cringing at the possibility president-elect Obama is going to commandeer their weapons, voted against him on that one issue.LiNeBrEaKIn actuality, the infamous Amendment II, the right "to keep and bear arms," was designed to assure a readily available civilian militia due to the lack of a viable government armed force. Today, our government maintains adequate armed forces.LiNeBrEaKAnother idea running rampant through my cranial maze is the assumption that Christian ethics are the basis for our national morality. Morality begins with the law, not vice versa. The Jews, beginning with the Ten Commandments, knew this, as does Islam; the Quran is its law.LiNeBrEaKChristian morality is based on the entreaties of Jesus and comes with a codicil: Sin, if you must, but confess your transgression, believe in Jesus and all will be forgiven. Claiming our country was founded on this basis as opposed to secularism is dangerous; it bodes Talibanism. Ironically, our forefathers came to America to escape religious persecution; the government-mandated religion of England allowed no intrusion or competition.LiNeBrEaKReligion is -- or should be -- intrinsically personal, by its nature having no public forum in a country governed by secular law. Political and religious charlatans cause irreparable harm to a society by pushing an agenda that intrudes upon both secular law and the personal convictions of both believers and non-believers.LiNeBrEaKYes, even believers suffer from demagogues who would bastardize the intent of their Master in order to achieve personal stature. The mega-church, with its mega-entertainment, is the antithesis of mega-belief.LiNeBrEaKIs it any wonder why political and social controversies continue to haunt my conscience? They should haunt yours as well.LiNeBrEaKSchleifer is a retired businessman living in Roanoke.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 	January 2, 2009 Friday   Metro Edition	SCIENTISTS DISAGREE ON CLIMATE CHANGE  	EDITORIAL; Pg. B6  	336 words  	It might surprise many Americans to learn that there is a U.S. Climate Change Science Program. The Bush administration has shown little fidelity to science, much less an open mind about the dangers of climate change. Nevertheless, the program exists, and it is pessimistic about the future. LiNeBrEaKThe researchers, led by the U.S. Geological Society, quietly released their findings in the days leading up to the holidays. Their predictions for the 21st century differ from other prominent findings such as those of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.LiNeBrEaKLooking at the available data, the U.S. scientists concluded sea levels will rise faster than had been previously predicted, droughts could be worse in the United States, methane released from the seabed and permafrost probably will not be too bad, and the Atlantic Ocean's circulation of warm water should be safe.LiNeBrEaKSome might look at the different findings as cause for more skepticism. "See," they will say, "even the scientists can't agree on what will happen."LiNeBrEaKThey would be right, as far as they go. Scientists do not agree on the details. Figuring out what the climate will be like in 100 years is a complex undertaking. Tweak a few variables and the results can change radically.LiNeBrEaKYet those differences lie in the specific effects of climate change. The scientific community is in broad agreement that increasing levels of human-generated greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are causing the planet to warm. They agree, too, that nations must act soon to prevent the worst results, if there is even time left.LiNeBrEaKIt is like when people catch the flu. Doctors can easily diagnose the disease, but they cannot easily predict which symptoms someone will have. One patient might vomit, while another experiences only mild nausea. One might sneeze uncontrollably, while another coughs.LiNeBrEaKIn the same way, the planet is sick, and scientists forecast a range of possible effects. America can wait for the symptoms to manifest or it can work to remove the cause now.

San Antonio Express-News 	January 2, 2009 Friday   METRO Edition	Session may be tinted green  	METRO AND STATE NEWS; Pg. 1B  	1066 words  	Green issues have never dominated Texas politics, but this legislative session promises to be a busy one for environmental organizations who see support building for action on key issues ranging from global warming and solar power to air quality regulation and green jobs.LiNeBrEaKTopping the agenda for most environmental lobbyists is reducing Texans' appetite for energy and jumpstarting the state's fledgling solar industry. LiNeBrEaKSuch topics have often been battled on party lines in a statehouse dominated by oil and gas interests, and this year much will depend on how the dust settles in the battle for speaker of the House. But several political insiders and lawmakers said this session promises a more bi-partisan feel for issues once associated only with environmentalists.LiNeBrEaK"A lot of things are lining up here," said Luke Metzger of the Austin-based Environment Texas.LiNeBrEaKAmong them, pushing more stringent energy conservation goals should garner significant bipartisan support, said Rep. Joe Straus, R-San Antonio. This session's efforts will build on momentum from an energy bill passed in 2007, he said. That law requires all utilities to use conservation and efficiency to meet 20 percent of their energy growth - demand for energy caused by growth - by the end of 2009.LiNeBrEaK"We doubled it in the '07 law," said Straus, who was primary sponsor of the legislation. "We're hoping we can double it again or better. We'll have to see how far and how quickly we can continue on this path."LiNeBrEaKThe starting point in this year's debate will be a recently completed energy conservation study by the Public Utility Commission, Straus said. The study found the state's investor-owned utilities could reduce their energy use 23 percent through energy efficiency programs. The study did not cover public utilities, like San Antonio's CPS Energy, which already has an aggressive conservation program.LiNeBrEaKThis could also be the year that solar energy, long a distant second fiddle to wind in the state's renewable energy production, gets significant help from the Legislature. Solar proponents are pushing a two-prong strategy.LiNeBrEaKThe first is to carve out a solar requirement, or at least a non-wind requirement, in the state's mandate that utilities produce a certain amount of power with renewable resources. A similar strategy in 1999 helped launch the state's wind energy industry, which is now tops in the nation. And proponents believe requiring even a small amount of the state's energy from solar will jumpstart the industry and help make it economically competitive in only a few years.LiNeBrEaKThe second solar strategy is a push for a statewide incentive program for rooftop solar systems similar to the programs already offered by utilities like CPS Energy and Austin Energy.LiNeBrEaKMany lawmakers have discussed developing the solar energy industry as a key to creating a new class of "green jobs" to help the state's flagging economy. State Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, believes that the time is right and said she will file a major bill the first week or two of the session, which starts Jan. 13.LiNeBrEaKThat bill, she said, will likely be co-authored with state Sen. Troy Fraser, who chairs the Business and Commerce Committee. The partnership, which would give the legislation bipartisan support, grew out of a conversation Van de Putte had with Fraser about solar.LiNeBrEaK"I was elated," she said. "I was hoping for support, but now I have a chairman saying, 'I want to champion this.'"LiNeBrEaKVan de Putte has also re-filed a bill from last session that, if approved by voter referendum, would open up $250 million in state bonds for hydrogen energy projects. She expects the legislation to be expanded to include solar and other renewable energy projects and possibly even those aimed at developing clean coal technology.LiNeBrEaKThe state's environmental groups will also push hard for energy efficient building codes and fight for permitting reform to require companies that want to build large industrial facilities to first analyze the cumulative impact of the combined pollutants of all such industrial plants in a region.LiNeBrEaKCurrently, the state requires that the pollution of plants within 35 miles be analyzed, said Tom Smith of Public Citizen. This has been a problem as energy companies have rushed to build coal plants throughout the state at the same time that every major metropolitan area in Texas is in jeopardy of failing the federal government's new air quality standards for ground-level ozone pollution.LiNeBrEaK"None of them have to look at the net impact of having all the power plants built at the same time," Smith said. "That's nuts."LiNeBrEaKMost who follow environmental issues don't expect to see much legislation pass that directly deals with global warming. But they said the emphasis on lowering power demand and pushing other legislation like possible tax breaks for fuel-efficient vehicles should have a positive impact on the issue.LiNeBrEaKOne obstacle to significant global warming legislation could be Gov. Rick Perry.LiNeBrEaKPerry, who has long been an outspoken skeptic of man-made climate change, reiterated his stance against government mandates to battle climate change at a press conference in November. The comments came in reaction to the growing momentum in Washington, D.C., to pass some kind of cap on greenhouse gas emissions, a move many expect to be championed by the Obama administration.LiNeBrEaKPerry said such a move "will cripple the Texas economy" and that the notion that the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide can be regulated as a pollutant "is a large stretch for some of us that have common sense."LiNeBrEaKState Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, said such a stance will leave Texas at a disadvantage when new regulations come down from Washington.LiNeBrEaK"The governor repeatedly proves he is clueless as far as how to develop a 21st-century economy," he said. "You can't pass a bill without the governor signing it, but I think there are certain discreet things that we can accomplish in the legislative process that the governor will sign into law."LiNeBrEaKVan de Putte, though, expects many of the issues normally associated with greenies to move forward this session, in part because of political necessity created by shifting priories of the electorate.LiNeBrEaK"We've seen a very powerful alliance that I've never seen before," she said. "When you get evangelicals, Sierra Club members and the sportsmen all together on the environmental bandwagon, they are a powerful caucus."

San Jose Mercury News (California)  	January 2, 2009 Friday 	Solar-power industry remains hot in California  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1132 words  	Jan. 2--Despite the turbulent economy, or perhaps because of it, solar energy remains a growth industry in California.LiNeBrEaKThe amount of electricity generated in the state by solar energy soared in 2008, and applications for rebates under the state's Million Solar Roofs program reached record levels in the last five months of the year.LiNeBrEaK"While we don't have the final numbers yet, it appears we nearly doubled the amount of solar installed in 2008 versus 2007," said Molly Tirpak Sterkel, director of the California Solar Initiative. "That's a magnificent story."LiNeBrEaKExperts attribute the surge in solar sales to a big increase in the federal tax credit, an ongoing state rebate and new innovative financing programs, as well as to mounting consumer concerns over global warming. The growth comes despite a U.S. economy suffering from a battered stock market, severe declines in house and car sales, and growing unemployment. LiNeBrEaKPerhaps 150 megawatts or more of new solar panels were installed in California in 2008, Sterkel said, up from 81 megawatts in 2007. (In California, one megawatt is enough electricity for 750 houses.)LiNeBrEaKShe noted that California has more than half of the solar capacity in the United States, and that the state ranks as the world's No. 4 solar entity after Germany, Spain and Japan.LiNeBrEaKSolar's growth here is "somewhat surprising, as we expected the economic downtown might have some dampening effect," said Damon Franz, an energy analystLiNeBrEaKwith the California Public Utilities Commission.LiNeBrEaKSales increased because consumers now see solar as a safe economic bet, and a hedge against rising energy prices, said Lyndon Rive, chief executive of Solar City, a solar installer based in Foster City.LiNeBrEaKTax incentiveLiNeBrEaKOthers credit inaction, then action, by the U.S. Congress for boosting solar. Fears that Congress wouldn't extend the federal solar tax credit past the end of 2008 spurred activity in the early fall as consumers and installers rushed to get projects completed by the end of the year. Then once Congress extended the tax credit for eight years and lifted a $2,000 cap in favor of a 30 percent credit, consumers jumped in to be first in line to get their systems -- and their credit -- after Jan. 1.LiNeBrEaKCombined, the federal tax credit and the California incentives can reduce the cost of a residential solar system, which typically costs $25,000 to $35,000, by as much as $14,000.LiNeBrEaKIn the 24-month history of the California Solar Initiative, the busiest five months for applications were August through December of 2008. More than 1,000 applications were received in August, the largest monthly number to that point in the program's history, and the number reached a record 1,316 in December.LiNeBrEaKThe California Solar Initiative is run regionally by public utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric has collected many more applications than Southern California Edison, which serves the greater Los Angeles area, or the California Center for Sustainable Energy, which runs the program in the San Diego area.LiNeBrEaKThrough Dec. 31, applications in PGandE's Northern and Central California territory represented 52 of the 79 megawatts for residential systems and 118 of 219 megawatts for nonresidential systems.LiNeBrEaK'Big momentum'LiNeBrEaKChuck Hornbrook, PGandE's senior manager for solar and customer generation, expects the utility to connect more than 1,000 solar systems to the grid in January. Many of those will be customers who had put off making the connection in order to get the larger federal tax credit, he said.LiNeBrEaK"There's a big momentum," Hornbrook said.LiNeBrEaKStatewide, 18,199 homeowners or businesses have applied for rebates on 298 megawatts worth of solar panels since the program started in January 2007. The goal of the California Solar Initiative is to have 3,000 megawatts of solar power installed by 2016, and $3. 3 billion have been allocated to three programs to reach that goal.LiNeBrEaKOn Friday, 1 Block Off the Grid, a San Francisco startup that negotiates communitywide discounts for solar projects, said it had selected Solar City for its next round of Bay Area installations, which includes San Jose.LiNeBrEaKWhile its original goal was to put solar on 75 homes, Dave Llorens, 1BOG's general manager, said the company already has 667 people who have signed up to have their homes evaluated.LiNeBrEaKSuch communitywide efforts, Llorens said, push down solar prices while providing homeowners with a well-vetted installer and a pre-negotiated deal.LiNeBrEaK"It's the magic of knowing everyone else is getting the same deal," Llorens said.LiNeBrEaKFor Solar City, working with 1BOG means it doesn't have to spend as much on advertising and sales calls to attract new customers. So it can offer discounted rates, Rive said.LiNeBrEaK1BOG was acquired by another San Francisco startup, Virgance, in November, which has expanded the solar-buying cooperative to 20 cities nationwide, including San Jose.LiNeBrEaKIn San Jose's Blossom Valley neighborhood, Fiona Marshall has signed up to get a solar system via 1 Block Off the Grid. "They've done all the legwork," she said, adding that was important because she and husband Tim just had a new baby.LiNeBrEaKIt was the change in the federal tax credit that spurred their decision.LiNeBrEaK"Now we can have a solar system and not have to wait 20 years to break even," she said.LiNeBrEaKContact Matt Nauman at (408) 920-5701 or at mnauman@mercurynews.comLiNeBrEaK--Federal: In late 2008, Congress extended the federal tax credit for solar systems by eight years, and waived a $2,000 tax cap in favor of a 30 percent tax credit. For most consumers, this makes putting a solar photovoltaic system on their roof thousands of dollars cheaper.LiNeBrEaK--State: Incentives from the California Solar Initiative decline as the number of installed megawatts grows. Its residential incentives began at $2. 50 a watt and have dropped several times since. Customers scrambled to get the $1. 90-a- per watt rate before it fell to $1. 55 a watt on Dec. 1. Other incentive programs are available for new homes, low-income housing and nonresidential systems.LiNeBrEaK--San Jose: This past summer, Mayor Chuck Reed challenged local solar installers to offer systems to city residents that required no money down.

San Jose Mercury News (California)  	January 2, 2009 Friday 	Solar industry remains hot  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1132 words  	Jan. 2--Despite the turbulent economy, or perhaps because of it, solar energy remains a growth industry in California.LiNeBrEaKThe amount of electricity generated in the state by solar energy soared in 2008, and applications for rebates under the state's Million Solar Roofs program reached record levels in the last five months of the year.LiNeBrEaK"While we don't have the final numbers yet, it appears we nearly doubled the amount of solar installed in 2008 vs. 2007," said Molly Tirpak Sterkel, director of the California Solar Initiative. "That's a magnificent story."LiNeBrEaKExperts attribute the surge in solar sales to a big increase in the federal tax credit, an ongoing state's rebate and new innovative financing programs, as well as to mounting consumer concerns over global warming. The growth comes despite a U.S. economy suffering from a battered stock market, severe declines in house and car sales, and growing unemployment. LiNeBrEaKPerhaps 150 megawatts or more of new solar panels were installed in California in 2008, Sterkel said, up from 81 megawatts in 2007. (In California, one megawatt is enough electricity for 750 houses.)LiNeBrEaKShe noted that California has more than half of the solar capacity in the United States, and that the state ranks as the world's No. 4 solar entity after Germany, Spain and Japan.LiNeBrEaKSolar's growth here is "somewhat surprising, as we expected the economic downtown might have some dampening effect," said Damon Franz, an energy analystLiNeBrEaKwith the California Public Utilities Commission.LiNeBrEaKSales increased because consumers now see solar as a safe economic bet, and a hedge against rising energy prices, said Lyndon Rive, the chief executive officer of Solar City, a solar installer based in Foster City.LiNeBrEaKOthers credit inaction, then action, by the U.S. Congress for boosting solar. Fears that Congress wouldn't extend the federal solar tax credit past the end of 2008 spurred activity in the early fall as consumers and installers rushed to get projects completed by the end of the year. Then once Congress extended the tax credit for eight years and lifted a $2,000 cap in favor of a 30 percent credit, consumers jumped in to be first in line to get their systems -- and their credit -- after Jan. 1.LiNeBrEaKCombined, the federal tax credit and the California incentives can reduce the cost of a residential solar system, which typically costs $25,000 to $35,000, by as much as $14,000.LiNeBrEaKIn the 24-month history of the California Solar Initiative, the busiest five months for applications were August through December of 2008. More than 1,000 applications were received in August, the largest monthly number in the program's history, and the number reached a record 1,250 in December.LiNeBrEaKCSI is run regionally by public utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric has collected many more applications than Southern California Edison, which serves the greater Los Angeles area, or the California Center for Sustainable Energy, which runs the program in the San Diego area.LiNeBrEaKThrough Dec. 31, applications in PGandE's Northern and Central California territory represented 52 of the 79 megawatts for residential systems and 118 of 219 megawatts for non-residential systems.LiNeBrEaKChuck Hornbrook, PGandE's senior manager for solar and customer generation, expects the utility to connect more than 1,000 solar systems to the grid in January. Many of those will be customers who had put off making the connection in order to get the larger federal tax credit, he said.LiNeBrEaK"There's a big momentum," Hornbrook said.LiNeBrEaKStatewide, 18,199 homeowners or businesses have applied for rebates on 298 megawatts worth of solar panels since the program started in January of 2007. The goal of the California Solar Initiative is to have 3,000 megawatts of solar power installed by 2016, and $3. 3 billion have been allocated to three programs to reach that goal.LiNeBrEaKOn Friday, 1 Block Off the Grid, a San Francisco start-up that negotiates community-wide discounts for solar projects, said it had selected Solar City for its next round of Bay Area installations, which includes San Jose.LiNeBrEaKWhile its original goal was to put solar on 75 homes, Dave Llorens, 1BOG's general manager, said the company already has 667 people who have signed up to have their homes evaluated.LiNeBrEaKSuch community-wide efforts, Llorens said, push down solar prices while providing homeowners with a well-vetted installer and a pre-negotiated deal.LiNeBrEaK"It's the magic of knowing everyone else is getting the same deal," Llorens said.LiNeBrEaKFor Solar City, working with 1BOG means it doesn't have to spend as much on advertising and sales calls to attract new customers. So it can offer discounted rates, Rive said.LiNeBrEaK1BOG was acquired by another San Francisco start-up, Virgance, in November, which has expanded the solar-buying cooperative to 20 cities nationwide, including San Jose.LiNeBrEaKIn San Jose's Blossom Valley neighborhood, Fiona Marshall has signed up to get a solar system via 1 Block Off the Grid. "They've done all the legwork," she said, adding that was important because she and husband Tim just had a new baby.LiNeBrEaKIt was the change in the federal tax credit that spurred their decision.LiNeBrEaK"Now we can have a solar system and not have to wait 20 years to break even," she said.LiNeBrEaKContact Matt Nauman at (408) 920-5701 or at mnauman@mercurynews.comLiNeBrEaKSOLAR INCENTIVESLiNeBrEaKFederal: In late 2008, Congress extended the federal tax credit for solar systems by eight years, and waived a $2,000 tax cap in favor of a 30 percent tax credit. For most consumers, this makes putting a solar photo-voltaic system on their roof thousands of dollars cheaper.LiNeBrEaKState: Incentives from the California Solar Initiative decline as the number of installed megawatts grows. Its residential incentives began at $2. 50 per watt and have dropped several times since. Customers scrambled to get the $1. 90 per watt rate before it fell to $1. 55 per watt on Dec. 1, 2008. Other incentive programs are available for new homes, low-income housing and non-residential systems.LiNeBrEaKSan Jose: Last summer, Mayor Chuck Reed challenged local solar installers to offer systems to city residents that required no money down. Several companies responded, including Horizon Energy Systems, Petersen Dean Roofing, Power Solutions, REC Solar, Regrid Power, Solar City, StablSolar and Sunpower. But the city never endorsed any of the installers and, unlike San Francisco and Berkeley, never offered financial incentives for residents.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 2, 2009 Friday   FINAL Edition	Many delta islands may be lost;  Rising seas, sinking land, earthquakes, floods and escalating repair costs present dire threats to the state's 1,100 miles of weakening levees 	Main News; Pg. A1  	1408 words  	 Two decades ago, water breached a levee on Tyler Island, 8,800 acres along the northeastern edge of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, wiping out crops, damaging buildings and nearly destroying the Mello family's farming business. Steve Mello worries the same thing may happen again - with the approval of state policymakers who are considering whether to save some islands if increasingly fragile levees fail. It's a familiar scenario for Mello, who has heard proposals in the past to flood the land in the name of restoring a sensitive ecosystem that also serves as the hub of California's water supply.LiNeBrEaK"I feel like a lamb surrounded by wolves, and every time you turn to deal with one, another one is nipping at you," said Mello, who farms about 2,500 acres of alfalfa, corn, pears, potatoes and wheat. LiNeBrEaKFewer structures have been more critical to California's development than the 1,100 miles of earthen levees that help funnel water through the 1,300-square-mile confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers. That water, mostly runoff from mountain snowpack, flows through a web of channels to mammoth pumps in the southern delta, sending billions of gallons of water to 25 million Californians. LiNeBrEaKBut the levees are in trouble, experts say. Rising seas, earthquakes, subsiding land and floods pose dire threats on top of the escalating repair costs to the state. Rather than allowing nature to decide when and how the levees give way, many researchers and policymakers say, California should manage the inevitable reshaping of the delta by deciding which levees to repair after a disaster.LiNeBrEaKNo rules exist yet. But beginning this year, government, scientists, planners, environmentalists and water agencies will attempt to reconcile their views on the barriers that have defined the delta for so long.LiNeBrEaK"The delta is two or three different places," said Will Travis, executive director of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission. "From the perspective of the environmentalists, the delta is a piece of geography like San Francisco Bay or Yosemite that is near and dear. For water users, the delta is really a broad, leaky ditch and the water has to get from one side of delta through south side of delta."LiNeBrEaKLevee failures commonLiNeBrEaKOver the last 100 years, delta levees failed 166 times and all but three were restored. In the next century, according to a recent, influential report by the Public Policy Institute of California, the average island at the core of the delta has a 99 percent chance of being inundated by levee failure.LiNeBrEaKThe study concluded that as many as 19 islands in the delta's central area should not be repaired, depending on whether their property value includes land, structures and equipment. Many of those islands have infrastructure that includes railroads, bridges, aqueducts and energy facilities. As many as a dozen should be repaired, according to UC Davis scientists who wrote the report, while 11 are undetermined.LiNeBrEaKTyler Island, where land and assets are worth about $126 million, may not be worth saving, they say.LiNeBrEaKThe 2004 flooding of one island - Jones Tract - provided a stark example of the analysis that should go into a decision on any island, the experts say. A levee along the western side of the island collapsed, resulting in six months of repairs and pumping that cost $90 million, including $60 million in tax funds. The island's land was valued at $42 million, while assets on the island were worth about $500 million.LiNeBrEaKThe cost of buttressing all delta levees to widely used standards runs into the billions.LiNeBrEaK"The delta means a lot of things, but what it doesn't mean is that all levees that presently exist must continue to exist and be maintained at taxpayers' expense without regard for benefit, difficulty or rationality of doing so," said Phil Isenberg, chairman of the governor's Delta Vision Blue Ribbon Task Force, a panel tasked with developing a sustainable delta management plan.LiNeBrEaKSinking land biggest riskLiNeBrEaKA colossal earthquake, a 100-year rainstorm and the forecast of a 4 1/2-foot rise in the sea level by 2100: Each poses threats to the delta's levees, many of which sit below the level prescribed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.LiNeBrEaKBut scientists say one weakness compounds all of those calamities: land subsidence.LiNeBrEaKIn the 150 years since some of the levees were first carved out using horse-drawn dredgers, the land protected by the levees has sunk dramatically - pushing some of it 25 feet below sea level. Scientists say such differences are putting huge stress on the levees, raising the possibility of breaks or seepage. Fears grew after the catastrophic collapse of New Orleans' levees after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.LiNeBrEaKA drive around Tyler Island shows that some of Mello's fields sit near the island's average elevation of 9 feet below sea level. But Mello, whose family first bought land on Tyler in 1968, believes most delta islands are not as vulnerable as some experts suggest. The lowest subsidence occurs at the center of most islands, not up against the levees, Mello said, and farmers who cultivate two-thirds of the delta's 740,000 acres are using techniques to prevent erosion. Those include less-intensive farming, less burning to level land and growing fewer crops like white asparagus, which turned the topsoil "to flour," Mello said.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, reclamation districts are spending millions to upgrade their levees, including about $6 million in the last eight years to raise 7 miles of levees on Tyler Island by about a foot. "I believe many of these farms, if not all of them, can be farmed indefinitely," Mello said.LiNeBrEaKHe said forcing or allowing the levees to dissolve poses other major dangers, including the release of mercury accumulated in the levees during the region's strip-mining days. While environmentalists say creating tidal marshes and open water could boost important fish and plant populations, Mello and others say islands act as buffers for each other.LiNeBrEaK"There are difficulties finding one of the major islands you could flood and leave flooded without having a domino effect," said Tom Zuckerman, a retired Stockton water lawyer who now works with the Central Delta Water Agency. "You won't just lose one island; you'll lose the adjacent ones downwind."LiNeBrEaKScenarios for the futureLiNeBrEaKThe debate over the delta levees will take on new urgency in the coming years as the state grapples with how to fix a water system plagued by leaky plumbing, booming demand and concerns over ecological damage.LiNeBrEaKA controversial proposal to construct a so-called peripheral canal - which would route water from the Sacramento River around the delta to pumps in the south - dovetails with the idea to let some delta islands return to marsh or open water. In such a scenario, any increase in salty water from the broader bay-delta estuary wouldn't affect the fresh Sacramento water streaming through the separate canal.LiNeBrEaKBut many of the 6,000 people who live in the delta's interior say that option doesn't recognize important transportation lines, historic communities, schools, Victorian hotels, sought-after recreational activities and family farms.LiNeBrEaKToday's delta is a far cry from the tidal marsh that pre-dated modern development or the early operations of the Gold Rush. Many experts agree the delta's mix of islands and waterways has harmed native fish and plants that depended on the ebb and flow between river and bay.LiNeBrEaKRadical change is coming, they argue, whether forced by man or nature.LiNeBrEaK"With the delta, the natural systems are very dynamic and changing rapidly now," Travis said. "It's hard to have a political, legal, regulatory system that embraces that kind of change. It's hard, but we need to make some decisions."LiNeBrEaKAfter working for two years away from the ranch, Mello's son Gary, 22, came back to drive combines, work on irrigation systems and learn the intricacies of accounting. Mello, 53, hopes the island survives long enough for the next generation to take over.LiNeBrEaK"I'm trying to make sure it evolves and passes to them as a viable business," Mello said. "I think they're pulling the plug way too early."LiNeBrEaKWhich levees should be saved? LiNeBrEaKResearchers at UC Davis say it may not make financial sense to save all of the at-risk Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta levees.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 2, 2009 Friday   FINAL Edition	Mysterious mating habits;  vallejo;  Researchers are seeking to learn the secrets of walrus reproduction	Metro; Pg. B1  	1175 words  	Jocko belly-flopped onto the artificial ice floe in the middle of his Vallejo pool and rocked back and forth - a blubbery portrait of walrus bliss. LiNeBrEaKHis counterparts in the wild should have it so good. Their Arctic ice floes are shrinking because of global warming, which means their numbers could decrease.LiNeBrEaKThat possibility makes the breeding behavior of Jocko and his two female friends, who live at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom, fascinating to scientists - to the point that one researcher is creating an artificial vagina to entice the 2,200-pound Pacific walrus into sexual acts that can be measured and quantified.LiNeBrEaK"This would be the first semen sample out of a walrus in the wild or captivity," said Holley Muraco, a specialist in marine mammal reproduction who has constructed similar body parts for horses, cows and pigs. LiNeBrEaKShe said the dramatic changes likely to occur in the Arctic would affect walrus breeding, an obscure activity about which little is known, partly because it happens underwater and partly because Pacific walruses live in a remote part of the world.LiNeBrEaK"It's extremely mysterious," Muraco said. "They're very inaccessible. But we're able to study the Six Flags walruses so intimately, and they participate so fully, that we can apply that science to wild animals if we need to."LiNeBrEaKIf researchers can understand and demystify walrus sex, their findings will shed light on how environmental change can influence the conditions that hurt or help breeding.LiNeBrEaKThe 14-year-old Vallejo residents - who are already sexually active but have nothing to show for it - are among only 30 or so captive walruses divided among seven facilities in the United States. The Discovery Kingdom animals offer unusual access because they arrived at 2 weeks of age as unrelated orphans from the Bering Sea, and were raised and trained by humans.LiNeBrEaKThe walruses' mothers had been killed during a subsistence hunt. The pups were given Yupik names suggested by Eskimo schoolchildren: Uquq blubber, Siku ice and Sivuqaq the ancient name for the village of Gambell, Alaska, who was dubbed Jocko in the movie "50 First Dates."LiNeBrEaKJocko, still growing, could reach 4,000 pounds, while the females are about 1,700 pounds apiece and gaining steadily. Like other members of their species, they are gregarious, surprisingly agile and prone to blowing snot on whatever or whomever is nearby.LiNeBrEaK"They want to feel what you're wearing with their whiskers and they want to breathe in your nose," said Discovery Kingdom animal trainer Robert Roozendaal on Tuesday, as the three walruses inspected a visitor to their indoor quarters. "It's a walrus greeting."LiNeBrEaKJocko, described as exceptionally mellow and laid back, ate ice cubes and sucked on his tongue. Siku, an overachiever and the "honor roll student" in the group, slid into the pool, while the lazy but assertive Uquq did sit-ups.LiNeBrEaK"A lot of animals have personality, but these guys are so interactive they can express that personality with more animation," Roozendaal said. LiNeBrEaK Toni Rael, another animal trainer at the Vallejo theme park, said polar bears have gotten most of the attention in the uproar over global warming, while walruses have been overlooked - although the Center for Biological Diversity, a conservation group, sued the U.S. government in December to force it to add the Pacific walrus to a list of threatened species. A census is now under way, but there are no hard numbers for the elusive creatures.LiNeBrEaK"They're an underappreciated marine mammal," Rael said. "But it's funny how they capture your heart."LiNeBrEaKSweet, lovable creaturesLiNeBrEaKRon Schusterman, a research marine biologist at UC Santa Cruz, has been studying the sounds of the walruses at Discovery Kingdom since they were babies.LiNeBrEaK"They're so lovable," he said. "They truly are. They want to snuggle up to you all the time. Of all the animals I've worked with, they're the coziest. They love to rub and touch. They're just very sweet animals that right now need protecting."LiNeBrEaKSchusterman has scrutinized a vast repertoire of walrus vocalizations that include whistles, groans, bellows, grunts, knocks, taps and metallic bell sounds. He said he hopes that the Vallejo pinnipeds, who provided vocals in "Jurassic Park" and the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, will soon reproduce.LiNeBrEaK"It's very important that the animals in captivity should be bred if at all possible," he said. "It's a good way to make a contribution to the environment. We know so little about them."LiNeBrEaKAlthough the ice floe in the Six Flags pool was built out of surfboard material, it is treated like the real thing by Uquq, Jocko and Siku, who has no tusks because they became infected when she was younger. The white object is their favorite hangout, said Leah Coombs, marine mammal supervisor at Discovery Kingdom.LiNeBrEaKIn the wild, Coombs said, ice floes are crucial because Pacific walruses, not known as marathon swimmers, can rest on them, give birth on them and follow them during a lengthy migration from summer in the Chukchi Sea to winter in the Bering Sea. LiNeBrEaKWith fewer ice floes, the easily spooked herd animals retreat to rocky shores, where the calves are sometimes trampled to death by the adults when something frightens them and they take off en masse.LiNeBrEaKCoombs is excited about the reproduction study. "Nobody has figured it out yet," she said of walrus sex.LiNeBrEaKDestructive and dirtyLiNeBrEaKCaptive walruses are rare because they are difficult to acquire, given the many rules and regulations, as well as very destructive and dirty, said Michael Muraco, animal director at Discovery Kingdom.LiNeBrEaK"It's very expensive to manage them," he said. "And they're like an elephant. A lot of the food that comes in comes right back out."LiNeBrEaKHis wife will monitor the walruses' hormones, use ultrasound, determine when the females cycle during the winter breeding season and watch them mate under water - in addition to making the latex or rubber artificial vagina into which semen can be deposited when Jocko ejaculates. LiNeBrEaK"They're not shy with their sexuality," Holley Muraco said. "So we'll try to put the pieces of the puzzle together and see why we don't have a baby yet."LiNeBrEaKFor more pictures and a video of the walrus exhibit at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom, go to sfgate.com.LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKWalruses by the numbersLiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKMinutes that a walrus can hold  LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKits breath.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 2, 2009 Friday 	Lack of a national climate policy nothing to sneeze at  	COLUMNISTS  	763 words  	According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5 percent to 20 percent of the U.S. population gets the flu each year. Of those, about 200,000 people require hospitalization and 36,000 ultimately die. But imagine if, in addition to the stresses of cold and flu season, American health providers were annually confronted with widespread outbreaks of malaria or a host of other diseases that could spread into the United States due to global warming.LiNeBrEaKIf this sounds like a scenario from a Hollywood thriller, think again. LiNeBrEaKAccording to a growing body of research, the threat of global warming bringing new diseases to America's shores is one that U.S. policymakers need to take seriously. As the world warms, diseases are spreading farther, heat waves are lasting longer and air quality is declining.LiNeBrEaKIn 2005, the World Health Organization stated that the effects of climate change might have caused more than 150,000 deaths in the year 2000, and unless action were taken soon, succeeding years would likely fare worse. Indeed, a report released this December at a conference of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene warned that changing climates, when combined with international air travel, could help spread the scourge of malaria to areas in the United States and Europe that have historically remained untouched.LiNeBrEaKEvery outbreak of disease, or weather phenomena with adverse implications for human health -- such as smog -- has multiple causes. We can never say any isolated event stems solely from global warming.LiNeBrEaKBut using that as an excuse for inaction misses the larger point. Many public health threats are closely tied to the climate, and the hotter it is, the more likely these threats become. Global warming pollution, therefore, is stacking the deck against our own health.LiNeBrEaKSmog, for instance, is caused by the interaction between air pollutants, sunlight and heat. The United States regulates those pollutants leading to smog, but currently does not directly control the emissions that cause global warming.LiNeBrEaKThis ignores a key part of the problem, as rising temperatures are projected to increase U.S. smog-related deaths 4. 5 percent by mid-century, with a corresponding jump in asthma attacks, lung damage and cardiac arrest.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming is not just an abstract concern about wildlife at the world's poles. It's also a problem that hits close to home, and health professionals already see warning signs. In an issue devoted largely to global warming, the Journal of the American Medical Association urged, "It is not too late and none too soon for the health care community to advocate policies that wean us from fossil fuels and ultimately mitigate the extent of human-induced climate change."LiNeBrEaKThe spread of malaria poses one such problem. According to the WHO, in some countries with a heavy malaria burden the disease can account for as much as 40 percent of public health expenditures. This includes a combination of health care costs imposed both on the public (such as through the need for new infrastructure to handle increased medical demands) and directly on individuals and families (through increased personal expenditures on items such as antimalarial drugs).LiNeBrEaKWith the U.S. health-care system already under tremendous pressure, the additional challenge of global warming is one that our health-care providers can scarcely afford. Earlier this summer, the Environmental Protection Agency released the most comprehensive analysis to date on the U.S. health problems caused by global warming. That report, which compiled research from dozens of previous studies, found it "very likely" that heat-related morbidity and mortality would increase in the decades ahead, with broad impacts spanning every region of the country. LiNeBrEaKNevertheless, even with its latest report in hand, the agency has yet to officially declare whether or not greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health. While the EPA should get some credit for sounding an alarm, the agency hasn't provided any significant steps to address America's unrestrained carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKWhile relaxation in a warmer climate was historically prescribed for colds and a wide range of other ailments, global warming is nobody's cure. The health reports on climate change, from the EPA, CDC and WHO, should provide the stimulus for the next Congress and the Obama administration to enact binding, science-based limits on the emissions that cause global warming.LiNeBrEaKPhllis Cuttino is the director of the domestic global warming campaign for the Pew Environment Group.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 2, 2009 Friday 	Solar-power industry remains hot in California  	BREAKING; News; State; Local; Business; Lifestyle  	1058 words  	Despite the turbulent economy, or perhaps because of it, solar energy remains a growth industry in California.LiNeBrEaKThe amount of electricity generated in the state by solar energy soared in 2008, and applications for rebates under the state's Million Solar Roofs program reached record levels in the last five months of the year.LiNeBrEaK"While we don't have the final numbers yet, it appears we nearly doubled the amount of solar installed in 2008 versus 2007," said Molly Tirpak Sterkel, director of the California Solar Initiative. "That's a magnificent story." LiNeBrEaKExperts attribute the surge in solar sales to a big increase in the federal tax credit, an ongoing state rebate and new innovative financing programs, as well as to mounting consumer concerns over global warming. The growth comes despite a U.S. economy suffering from a battered stock market, severe declines in house and car sales, and growing unemployment.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps 150 megawatts or more of new solar panels were installed in California in 2008, Sterkel said, up from 81 megawatts in 2007. (In California, one megawatt is enough electricity for 750 houses.)LiNeBrEaKShe noted that California has more than half of the solar capacity in the United States, and that the state ranks as the world's No. 4 solar entity after Germany, Spain and Japan.LiNeBrEaKSolar's growth here is "somewhat surprising, as we expected the economic downtown might have some dampening effect," said Damon Franz, an energy analyst with the California Public Utilities Commission.LiNeBrEaKSales increased because consumers now see solar as a safe economic bet, and a hedge against rising energy prices, said Lyndon Rive, chief executive of Solar City, a solar installer based in Foster City.LiNeBrEaKTax incentiveLiNeBrEaKOthers credit inaction, then action, by the U.S. Congress for boosting solar. Fears that Congress wouldn't extend the federal solar tax credit past the end of 2008 spurred activity in the early fall as consumers and installers rushed to get projects completed by the end of the year. Then once Congress extended the tax credit for eight years and lifted a $2,000 cap in favor of a 30 percent credit, consumers jumped in to be first in line to get their systems   and their credit   after Jan. 1.LiNeBrEaKCombined, the federal tax credit and the California incentives can reduce the cost of a residential solar system, which typically costs $25,000 to $35,000, by as much as $14,000.LiNeBrEaKIn the 24-month history of the California Solar Initiative, the busiest five months for applications were August through December of 2008. More than 1,000 applications were received in August, the largest monthly number to that point in the program's history, and the number reached a record 1,316 in December.LiNeBrEaKThe California Solar Initiative is run regionally by public utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric has collected many more applications than Southern California Edison, which serves the greater Los Angeles area, or the California Center for Sustainable Energy, which runs the program in the San Diego area.LiNeBrEaKThrough Dec. 31, applications in PGandE's Northern and Central California territory represented 52 of the 79 megawatts for residential systems and 118 of 219 megawatts for nonresidential systems.LiNeBrEaK'Big momentum'LiNeBrEaKChuck Hornbrook, PGandE's senior manager for solar and customer generation, expects the utility to connect more than 1,000 solar systems to the grid in January. Many of those will be customers who had put off making the connection in order to get the larger federal tax credit, he said.LiNeBrEaK"There's a big momentum," Hornbrook said.LiNeBrEaKStatewide, 18,199 homeowners or businesses have applied for rebates on 298 megawatts worth of solar panels since the program started in January 2007. The goal of the California Solar Initiative is to have 3,000 megawatts of solar power installed by 2016, and $3. 3 billion have been allocated to three programs to reach that goal.LiNeBrEaKOn Friday, 1 Block Off the Grid, a San Francisco startup that negotiates communitywide discounts for solar projects, said it had selected Solar City for its next round of Bay Area installations, which includes San Jose.LiNeBrEaKWhile its original goal was to put solar on 75 homes, Dave Llorens, 1BOG's general manager, said the company already has 667 people who have signed up to have their homes evaluated.LiNeBrEaKSuch communitywide efforts, Llorens said, push down solar prices while providing homeowners with a well-vetted installer and a pre-negotiated deal.LiNeBrEaK"It's the magic of knowing everyone else is getting the same deal," Llorens said.LiNeBrEaKFor Solar City, working with 1BOG means it doesn't have to spend as much on advertising and sales calls to attract new customers. So it can offer discounted rates, Rive said.LiNeBrEaK1BOG was acquired by another San Francisco startup, Virgance, in November, which has expanded the solar-buying cooperative to 20 cities nationwide, including San Jose.LiNeBrEaKIn San Jose's Blossom Valley neighborhood, Fiona Marshall has signed up to get a solar system via 1 Block Off the Grid. "They've done all the legwork," she said, adding that was important because she and husband Tim just had a new baby.LiNeBrEaKIt was the change in the federal tax credit that spurred their decision.LiNeBrEaK"Now we can have a solar system and not have to wait 20 years to break even," she said.LiNeBrEaKContact Matt Nauman at (408) 920-5701 or at mnauman@mercurynews.comLiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKFederal: In late 2008, Congress extended the federal tax credit for solar systems by eight years, and waived a $2,000 tax cap in favor of a 30 percent tax credit. For most consumers, this makes putting a solar photovoltaic system on their roof thousands of dollars cheaper. State: Incentives from the California Solar Initiative decline as the number of installed megawatts grows. Its residential incentives began at $2. 50 a watt and have dropped several times since. Customers scrambled to get the $1. 90-a- per watt rate before it fell to $1. 55 a watt on Dec. 1. Other incentive programs are available for new homes, low-income housing and nonresidential systems. San Jose: This past summer, Mayor Chuck Reed challenged local solar installers to offer systems to city residents that required no money down. Several companies responded, including Horizon Energy Systems, Petersen Dean Roofing, Power Solutions, StablSolar and SunPower. But the city never endorsed any of the installers and, unlike San Francisco and Berkeley, never offered financial incentives for residents.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	January 02, 2009 Friday 	LAME DUCKS NOT LACKING LAST QUACKS  	NEWS; Pg. A10  	863 words  	WE CALL THEM "lame ducks," but defeated and on-the-way-out politicians can strike with the speed of a prairie falcon and dig their talons deep into the public interest.LiNeBrEaKA striking example is formerly avuncular GOP state Lands Commissioner Doug Sutherland, who was narrowly defeated in November by Democratic rancher Peter Goldmark.LiNeBrEaKSutherland did not take his loss well - "the people of King County have spoken" - and has spent the holiday season bestowing sugarplums. LiNeBrEaKThe latest, last week, was a Department of Natural Resources decision to let Taylor Shellfish harvest and sell geoducks that the firm planted on state-owned tidelands near Olympia.LiNeBrEaKThe first that Goldmark heard about the deal was when reporters called for comment.LiNeBrEaKIn July, Joseph Panesko, assistant attorney general with the natural resources division, wrote that the DNR was "actively investigating" intrusion by Taylor's aquaculture operations on state lands. He added, "The state takes seriously all incidents of unauthorized use of state-owned aquatic lands, whether shellfish aquaculture or any other use, and Taylor Shellfish will be held accountable for its unauthorized use of state- owned aquatic lands."LiNeBrEaKInstead, the violator gets a tailor-made deal from which it stands to make millions.LiNeBrEaK"It looks bad, it smells bad," said Aaron Toso, an aide to Goldmark. "The explanation was that they've worked on this for a long time. Why rush it through?"LiNeBrEaKThe answer: Outgoing administrations want decisions set in place, leaving their successors with the challenge of unscrambling an egg.LiNeBrEaKThe administration has set out to virtually eviscerate the Endangered Species Act and keep global warming off the table when federal agencies consider impacts on animals, marine life and plants.LiNeBrEaKThe Bushies proceeded with another atrocity - oil and gas lease sales on federal land in Utah near Arches and Canyonlands national parks and Dinosaur National Monument.LiNeBrEaKA University of Utah student, Tim DeChristopher, is a new environmental hero. He sabotaged the Bureau of Land Management's lease sale by submitting bogus, artificially high bids on lease sales near the parks.LiNeBrEaKThe BLM is supposed to wait 30 days, but the Bush administration may try to pull off another sale before President-elect Barack Obama is inaugurated.LiNeBrEaKOther countries do it differently.LiNeBrEaKA defeated British prime minister drives to Buckingham Palace, submits his (or her) resignation to the queen, and moves out of No. 10 Downing Street. The successor goes at once to the palace.LiNeBrEaKThe same holds true in Canada. Outgoing Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau memorably roared off at the wheel of a Mercedes convertible.LiNeBrEaK"I won't have you to kick around anymore," he told reporters, reversing the immortal Nixon line.LiNeBrEaK(In nine months, Trudeau was back at Rideau Hall, seat of Canada's governor-general, to again be named prime minister.)LiNeBrEaKAmericans muddle the change of power.LiNeBrEaKThe general election was Nov. 4. Our 44th president gets sworn in Jan. 20. Our state's new lands commissioner takes office Jan. 14.LiNeBrEaKSutherland was not happy to lose. "Well, I really wanted to write this memo in 2012, but the people of our state have decided otherwise," he wrote to DNR employees.LiNeBrEaKHe also told them, in his Nov. 19 letter, "I have no idea what Mr. Goldmark has in mind as I have not yet spoken to him."LiNeBrEaKWe're into 2009: Sutherland has yet to sit down with Goldmark. A single DNR manager was designated the "point of contact." Two Goldmark aides have gone on the department's payroll. Goldmark has talked with senior DNR managers and established advisory groups.LiNeBrEaKStill, is this the optimum way to change the guard in an outfit with 1,400 employees, charged with managing 5. 6 million acres of state-owned land?LiNeBrEaKGov. Chris Gregoire has targeted the DNR for budget cuts. Goldmark needs to know the vitals of the agency as its boss-advocate.LiNeBrEaKSutherland has also taken his last weeks in office to reward a major political supporter. He awarded a lease of state tidelands to Glacier Northwest, a company that wants to massively expand its sand and gravel mine on Maury Island.LiNeBrEaKGlacier Northwest gave $50,000 to the Committee for Responsible Stewardship, a front group formed by timber and mining companies to promote Sutherland's re-election. It also directly contributed $2,800 to Sutherland's campaign.LiNeBrEaKBoth sides play the game of eleventh hour policymaking.LiNeBrEaKA defeated President Jimmy Carter signed the Alaska Lands Act, which set aside 103 million acres of our 49th state as national parks, monuments, wilderness areas and wild and scenic rivers.LiNeBrEaKPresident Bill Clinton designated national monuments and promulgated a rule that forbade construction of new roads on millions of acres of still-wild national forest land.LiNeBrEaKStill, the gap doesn't serve the nation or state.LiNeBrEaKWouldn't America be better off if Obama were already in office, with a stimulus plan in place?LiNeBrEaKWouldn't the state be better served if a new lands commissioner was already reforming the DNR, instead of a defeated politician doing backdoor deals on his way out the door?

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	January 2, 2009 Friday   FINAL EDITION	For green consumers, it's the fiscal blues  	NEWS; Pg. 001  	1421 words  	In a speedy recognition of the anvil-like drop in hybrid car sales, Toyota postpones the opening of a Prius factory.LiNeBrEaKPurchases of organic food slow as consumers decide there isn't room in the family budget for pricier products. Solar energy projects stall as credit and government subsidies dry up.LiNeBrEaKAre we done with green?LiNeBrEaKNow that money is tight, will environmentalism turn out to have been just a passing trend - the political equivalent of the Pet Rock? LiNeBrEaKProbably not, say the experts. While some consumers may have to put their concern for the planet on the back burner for now, they will likely resume their new-found green habits once the economy improves.LiNeBrEaK"It was all about the environment last year. But it's all about the economy this year. It's like we can't think about more than one thing at a time. It's either one or the other - almost as if we can't do both," said Ann Mack, who forecasts trends for the advertising firm JWT, formerly J. Walter Thompson. "Everything was advertised as green last year, so it became a little trendy. But I see it more as a shift that just ingrained green in whatever we do."LiNeBrEaKHowever, those who still have the money to buy high-end green products may become a bit more circumspect about it, she predicted.LiNeBrEaKIn flush times, letting people know you drink organic vodka might bring admiration. In a recession, however, that might be seen as bad form, she said.LiNeBrEaK"People are becoming more incognito in whatever their little luxuries are," she said. "So even if they buy organic or fair trade products, they're not going to flaunt it. They're going to be a little more subtle about it."LiNeBrEaKThe green movement faces economic threats on two fronts: Job and housing losses leave consumers with less money to spend in general, and the precipitous drop in gas prices eliminated the economic incentive to switch to more efficient cars or heating.LiNeBrEaK"Some things green don't really pay. So if you're feeling strapped for cash, the temptation would be to cut back," said Cornell University economist Robert H. Frank, author of "Luxury Fever" and "The Winner-take-all Society."LiNeBrEaKYet even if a faltering economy makes consumers inclined to balk at any extra expense, a steady stream of environmental policies from an Obama administration will keep green front and center. Those policies will amount to a carbon tax, pushing up the cost of environmentally harmful activities, Frank said.LiNeBrEaK"It's going to be the official policy of the land that we now do worry about greenhouse gases," Frank said. "This idea that, 'I'm an American - I can spew out greenhouse gas to my heart's content' will die off," he said. "There is a new sensibility about being sustaining, and not just in the environmental sense. The economy wasn't sustained, in that we couldn't go on forever the way we were."LiNeBrEaKWhile some forms of green living are more costly - organic truffles, anyone? - others still save money.LiNeBrEaKDorothea Kellogg and her husband recently installed solar panels on their Ringoes home - a $40,000 investment triggered mostly to lower their electric bill.LiNeBrEaK"I admit there are several selfish reasons we did this," she said. "It wasn't, 'We're going to save lots of bugs and bunnies in the rain forest in Brazil.'"LiNeBrEaKThe Kelloggs expect their utility bills to drop by a third to a half. That savings, combined with a payment for the electricity they generate and a hefty rebate from the state of New Jersey, means the project should pay for itself in seven years.LiNeBrEaKThey are also assuming the panels will increase the resale value of their home - an assumption that future home-shoppers won't be done with green either. "I don't see energy costs going down significantly any time in the future," Kellogg said.LiNeBrEaKThe company that installed her panels, Advanced Solar Products in Hopewell, has plenty of work, thanks to a spurt of projects approved for state rebates. However, many other firms in the region are seeing customers cancel projects as financing and the tax-credit resale market have dried up, said Lyle Rawlings, president of the company and vice president of a solar industry trade group, the Mid-Atlantic Solar Energy Initiatives Association.LiNeBrEaK"The economy is causing problems. Even customers who are under contract are canceling," he said. But financial barriers are the cause - not flagging enthusiasm for solar energy in general, he said.LiNeBrEaKSales of organic food, which had seen double-digit growth in recent years, have slowed significantly. However, the industry is managing to hold onto its loyal customers - even as those customers shop more carefully, using coupons or selecting cheaper grocery house brands.LiNeBrEaK"The core organic consumers are sticking with their values," said Barbara Haumann, senior writer with the Organic Trade Association. "They will shop around, or find other things they can cut."LiNeBrEaK"Consumers who bought organic products willy-nilly might cut back because that's an easy way to save," said Mack, of the JWT advertising agency.LiNeBrEaKA 2005 Rutgers University study showed that while two-thirds of respondents were willing to pay more for locally grown farm product - not necessarily organic - a stubborn third was unwilling to pay anything extra it, even if its quality was assured.LiNeBrEaKOnly a very small sector was willing to pay up to 20 percent more for fresh produce. "They're idealists. They're buying the product because they want to support the environment. But that group is very small - one or two percent. But the price-sensitive consumer is not going to pay extra," he said.LiNeBrEaKIn one quirk of this rapidly changing economy, organic products have benefited from rising energy costs. Those costs were the main culprit in the last year's jump in food prices. Organic foods typically use less energy in their manufacture and distribution - less fertilizer, simpler packaging, and lower transportation costs for locally grown goods. That means they weren't hit as hard by the recent spike in energy prices, Haumann said.LiNeBrEaK"The price gap between organic and non-organic has narrowed," she said.LiNeBrEaKAmanda Fitzgerald, of Wharton, shops at a local farmer's market and especially likes the organic meat available there. She'd still make room for it in her budget, she said.LiNeBrEaKJaclyn Magliato, of Independence Township, also doesn't see cutting back on organic products at home - even as she tries to save paper in her teacher's job by making her students write on the back of hand-outs.LiNeBrEaK"Everything's organic now - food, cleaning products. If anything, that's the one area we haven't scrimped on," she said. "It's a question of health."LiNeBrEaKThe recent economic ambivalence about green products comes just as Barack Obama and his green-tinged policies are about to ride triumphantly into power.LiNeBrEaKEven opponents of those policies think the sheer momentum will make them unstoppable . . . at least for a time. Pat Michaels, with the Cato Institute think tank, noted both Obama and the newly elected Congress appear ready to make carbon emissions reduction "an absolute priority." Michaels, a climatologist, is the author of "Meltdown: The predictable distortion of global warming by scientists, politicians and the media."LiNeBrEaKHe predicts Obama could push green so hard it becomes his equivalent of the Clintons' failed attempt to remake the nation's health care system - an effort so large it collapses under its own weight.LiNeBrEaK"If there is an over-reach on the part of Washington, it's going to be on this issue," he said. "I don't think they're going to be able to stop the momentum they've created."LiNeBrEaKHe also predicts voters will eventually experience sticker shock when it comes to the very policies they supported in the voting booth. They may prove willing to ditch green initiatives quickly if they are perceived as too expensive - in much the same way they backed off of hybrid vehicles once gas dropped from $4 a gallon. "If people felt committed to green principles, when the price of gas changed, they'd continue to buy them. But they didn't," he said.LiNeBrEaKAt that stage, however, there won't be many ways to express their displeasure, he noted. "The electorate can't speak for another two years. And the people in charge seem very committed to a very green course," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe sour economy hits close to home for Greg Morris, of Randolph, who lost his job 18 months ago. The family uses energy-saving compact fluorescent light bulbs, which initially cost more, and even received some as a Christmas gift. He's considering relocating to another region, and said if he does, "I might take them with me."LiNeBrEaKTomorrow: The other side of the housing market	GREEN MARKET (90%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); MARKETING and ADVERTISING AGENCIES (90%); TRENDS (90%); AUTOMOTIVE SALES (90%); PUBLIC POLICY (89%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); RECESSION (78%); ECONOMIC NEWS (78%); ORGANIC FOODS (78%); OIL and GAS PRICES (77%); ECONOMIC RECOVERY (77%); PUBLIC FINANCE (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (76%); PERSONAL FINANCE (72%); SOLAR ENERGY (57%); GOVERNMENT GRANTS and SUBSIDIES (57%)  	BARACK OBAMA (51%)  	NEW JERSEY, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (79%)  	January 5, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Newark Morning Ledger Co.

The men - who are both deep-sea divers - wanted to make a completely different large-screen film and realized that no one had ever documented the annual sardine migration off the coast of the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.LiNeBrEaKThis area is "well known in diving circles as one of the most exciting dives on the planet," McNicholas said. "It is a very difficult dive on this open sea."LiNeBrEaK"Wild Ocean" intends to educate about global warming and overfishing. "Twenty thousand dolphins and thousands of sharks, humpback whales and gannets are all in motion along the coastline, and it's a wonderful thing to capture on film," McNicholas said. "Aquatic wildlife is a fraction of what it used to be and is completely devastated by overfishing. So to be able to say, 'Look at this,' and . . . go to Africa and see this incredible wildlife spectacle . . ."LiNeBrEaKMcNicholas and Croswell spent three migration cycles working on the 45-minute film, in June and July of 2005, 2006 and 2007. "It took six months to film it, but it felt like three years," McNicholas said.LiNeBrEaKMcNicholas directed the footage above the sea - much of which was done from helicopters, he said - while Croswell directed the footage underwater.LiNeBrEaKMcNicholas, who lives in Brighton, England, is working on a new London musical, "The Lost and Found Orchestra." He said he hopes the movie will "help to prevent overfishing and protect the ocean. We want to get the message across to people who see it."

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	January 2, 2009 Friday   FINAL EDITION	If there was a second ice age, a comet could be the reason Explosion 13,000 years ago sparked mass extinction, researchers say  	NEW JERSEY; Pg. 036  	675 words  	First an explosion as powerful as thousands of megatons of TNT rained meteorites down on North America. Then forest fires broke out across the continent, sending up a thick layer of soot and dust that blocked out the sun. A sudden ice age ensued, and some of the Earth's largest animals went extinct in a blink of geological time.LiNeBrEaKIt's well known that a meteorite colliding with Earth is considered the most likely reason dinosaurs died off 65 million years ago. Now a team of scientists says it has found new evidence that a comet triggered a similar extinction much more recently: just 13,000 years ago, when humans were around to witness the event and suffer its terrible consequences. LiNeBrEaKThe researchers also think that when the comet exploded above the planet's surface - ultimately killing off mammoths, saber-toothed tigers and other large mammals that roamed North America - Chicago wasn't too far from ground zero.LiNeBrEaK"If you'd been in Chicago back in that time, it would've been one very bad day," said Allen West, an Arizona geophysicist and one of the authors of a paper appearing today in the journal Science.LiNeBrEaKThe scientists, led by University of Oregon anthropologist Douglas Kennett, say their report offers up a "smoking bullet" - proof it was a comet that set off the sudden, thousand-year freeze and wiped out the big animals of the era.LiNeBrEaKWorking at multiple sites across the continent, researchers found nanodiamonds - microscopic particles thought to be found on comets - in a 13,000-year-old layer of rich sedimentary soil called a "black mat." Beneath the layer with the nanodiamonds, fossils of the animals are abundant. After that layer, they disappear, West said.LiNeBrEaK"It's extraordinary that tens of millions of animals disappeared synchronously at exactly the time when the diamonds and carbon layer are laid down across the continent," said West, whose co-authors include DePaul University chemist Wendy Wolbach.LiNeBrEaKArrowheads and other artifacts from the Clovis culture of humans - an early hunter-gatherer society - also vanish after the black mat was laid down 13,000 years ago.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, West and a team of scientists published an analysis of black mats from several regions that found heavy metals, soot and charcoal suggestive of meteorite impacts and subsequent fires. The new report says the discovery of nanodiamonds in the same material is more evidence of a cosmic strike.LiNeBrEaKArchaeologists have long speculated about whether climate change or over-hunting drove the mammoths, tigers and other "megafauna" to extinction and led to the decline of the Clovis culture.LiNeBrEaKMany remain skeptical of the comet theory and think there may be better explanations for what happened, said Daniel Amick, an associate professor of anthropology at Loyola University who studies the Clovis culture.LiNeBrEaK"When most archaeologists heard about it they were somewhat dismissive," Amick said. "We would think, 'How in the world could we have missed this? How could this spectacular kind of event have occurred and never even dawned on us?'"LiNeBrEaKThe authors have much to prove before their theory is accepted, Amick said, like pinpointing the date of the event and ruling out other potential causes of extinction and climate change.LiNeBrEaKIn response to one common criticism of the comet theory - that no craters have been found from an impact - West said the comet may not have actually reached Earth, but exploded into fragments somewhere above the surface.LiNeBrEaKWhere exactly that might have happened is a mystery, but high concentrations of nanodiamonds at a site in Eastern Michigan suggest the Great Lakes as a possibility.LiNeBrEaKThe idea that a comet may have caused catastrophic climate change and extinction relatively recently in Earth's long history suggests scientists shouldn't dismiss the possibility of it happening again, Wolbach said.LiNeBrEaK"Should we be doing more to try to deflect future asteroids, or is that too sci-fi?" she said. "If this is true and there was an impact 12. 9 thousand years ago, obviously this is not something that's just a theoretical idea, it's a real thing."

Volunteering, donating and making a difference are just a click away.LiNeBrEaKIt's 2009, and the Do Good Channel is going online.LiNeBrEaKI'm thrilled to introduce you to the St. Petersburg Times' new partnership with good2gether, a search engine and social network that will connect you to hundreds of local causes.LiNeBrEaKTo log on, just go to dogood.tampabay.com.Search by headings or keywords to volunteer, donate, find events, apply for jobs and read articles. LiNeBrEaKGood2gether founder Greg McHale came up with the concept of connecting the public with nonprofit groups during Hurricane Katrina.LiNeBrEaK"The local newspaper is the center of a nonprofit's universe, but there were almost no links, other than the American Red Cross. Yet hundreds responded to Katrina," McHale said.LiNeBrEaKFrom experience launching online charity auctions, McHale knew that nonprofits typically lack the staff and money to update their Web sites. And without significant traffic, he said, "Google can't find it."LiNeBrEaK"Every day newspapers are filled with articles about causes - education, cancer, social injustice, homeless, hunger, global warming. Every one of those articles could - and we would say should - give readers an opportunity to say, 'I should do something about this.' "LiNeBrEaKNow, when you read a story on tampabay.com about the Florida Orchestra having trouble making payroll, a "connect-a-cause" widget can take you to the orchestra's Web site to see how to you can pitch in. Read how a guide dog saved a life and click to become a trainer.LiNeBrEaK"The online newspaper becomes a call to action for people to get involved," said McHale. "It's a wonderful opportunity in these horrendous economic times for nonprofits to leverage the local market."LiNeBrEaKDo Good had me sold at events listings. Every day, organizations ask me to publish announcements of upcoming meetings, golf tournaments, wine tastings and such. But space is limited in print; not so on the Internet.LiNeBrEaKNow, any nonprofit organization, school or government agency can sign up to enter all the information they choose on the DoGood channel, and it's all free.LiNeBrEaKAs a bonus, nonprofits may choose to sell sponsorships, links and logos on their profiles, and share the revenue with good2gether. This is entirely optional. Sponsors pay a minimum of $100, and the organization keeps 65 cents of every dollar. (Good2gether keeps 35 cents.)LiNeBrEaKOnce charity is a part of your network, you'll be amazed at all the ways to get involved.

Vallejo Times Herald (California) 	January 2, 2009 Friday 	The other side  	LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  	498 words  	In a "My Turn" piece in the Times-Herald ("Going green: Good for the environment and the economy," Dec. 26), state Sen. Patricia Wiggins praised "our ground-breaking global warming law, AB 32," and criticized Republican legislators for opposing it. LiNeBrEaKCoincidentally, just the day before I ran across another op-ed piece that ran in the San Diego Union Tribune on Dec. 11: AB 32/Combating warming," by Robert N. Stavin.LiNeBrEaKStavin was a lead author on the second and third United Nations International Panel on Climate Change, (IPCC), Assessment Reports and served in the Clinton EPA, among many other achievements. Look him up -- you'll find that by no means could he be described as a skeptic, denier, or knuckle-dragging conservative. The following are a few lines from his critique of California Air Resources Board (CARB) and its AB 32 scoping plan:LiNeBrEaK"The stakes associated with these decisions are enormous. They could alter the annual cost of implementing AB 32 by literally billions of dollars.LiNeBrEaK(Carbs) analysis suggested that the plan's implementation would be costless, indeed that it would save Californians money.LiNeBrEaKAlong with five other economists, I was asked to participate in a peer review of the staff's analysis. I came to the inescapable conclusion that the analysis was deficient in critical ways and should not be used for the purpose of assessing the Proposed Scoping Plan's likely cost.LiNeBrEaKThe flaws reflected acts of both commission and omission, disturbing to any economist, and should cause concern for all citizens. Also the board publicly released its staff''s analysis before receiving feedback on that analysis from the peer review it had requested. The staff's analysis produces results that "contradict a wide body of economic modeling.LiNeBrEaKBy claiming that AB 32's implementation will be costless, the staff's economic analysis unfortunately obscures the real and substantial stakes.LiNeBrEaKIt is based on flawed analysis and inconsistent with decades of economic analysis on this important challenge."LiNeBrEaKSo there you have it -- a dramatically flawed and politicized law, touted by our very own state senator. Any one who thinks that global warming is anything more than a political issue designed as a way to allow more and more control of our personal decisions to accrue to the government needs to a do little more research. The Oregon Petition on Global Warming has the signatures of more than 3,000 credentialed scientists (ignored in the media) who dispute the claims of man-made warming. A recent senate minority report (ignored in the media) lists more than 600 scientists of the same view. Few of us have the where with all to argue the science. We need to read as much as we can from those who can and are trying to debate. But it's not easy to have a public debate when one side refuses to accept the challenge of a face to face debate in a public forum, when one side is pooh-poohed, denigrated, vilified and threatened or just plain ignored in the popular media.LiNeBrEaKJack KingLiNeBrEaKVallejo	LETTERS and COMMENTS (92%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (78%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (77%); LEGISLATORS (77%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (77%); PLATFORMS and ISSUES (72%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (70%); RESEARCH (67%); PETITIONS (60%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (55%)  		SAN DIEGO, CA, USA (92%) CALIFORNIA, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 2, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Times-Herald All Rights Reserved  		UNITED NATIONS (57%)  								CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD (56%)

The Washington Post 	January 2, 2009 Friday   Suburban Edition	Gems Point to Comet as Answer to Ancient Riddle  	A-SECTION; Pg. A02  	990 words  	Something dramatic happened about 12,900 years ago, and the continent of North America was never the same. A thriving culture of Paleo-Americans, known as the Clovis people, vanished seemingly overnight. Gone, too, were most of the largest animals:  horses, camels, lions, mammoths, mastodons, saber-toothed cats, ground sloths and giant armadillos.LiNeBrEaKScientists have long blamed climate change for the extinctions, for it was 12,900 years ago that the planet's emergence from the Ice Age came to a halt, reverting to glacial conditions for 1,500 years, an epoch known as the Younger Dryas. LiNeBrEaKIn just the last few years, there has arisen a controversial scientific hypothesis to explain this chain of events, and it involves an extraterrestrial calamity: a comet, broken into fragments, turning the sky ablaze, sending a shock wave across the landscape and scorching forests, creatures, people and anything exposed to the heavenly fire.LiNeBrEaKNow the proponents of this apocalyptic scenario say they have found a new line of evidence: nanodiamonds. They say  they have found these tiny structures across North America in sediments from 12,900 years ago, and they argue that the diamonds had to have been formed by a high-temperature, high-pressure event, such as a cometary impact.LiNeBrEaK"This is a big idea," said Douglas J. Kennett, an archaeologist at the University of Oregon and the lead author of a paper on the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis published today in the journal Science.LiNeBrEaKThe hypothesis has been hotly contested, as would be expected for a catastrophic tale that, so far, lacks anything as compelling as a crater. Nor are there signs of deformation in rock debris that is a signature of the massive impact that, 65 million years ago, apparently wiped out the dinosaurs.LiNeBrEaKBut Kennett and his colleagues say that  they have found these diamonds at the layer of sediment that marks the start of the Younger Dryas.  They are not found above or below that layer.LiNeBrEaKThese diamonds are measured in nanometers -- mere billionths of meters -- and one of them would not suffice for an engagement ring unless the recipient had an extremely small finger. Indeed, these diamonds are visible only with the aid of the most advanced microscopes.LiNeBrEaKThe wide distribution of the nanodiamonds could be a sign that the comet broke into pieces in space and that the fragments burned up explosively over a broad area of North America. The heat and pressure from the event transformed carbon on the planet's surface into the tiny diamonds, the scientists said.LiNeBrEaK"Imagine these fireballs exploding in the air. A Clovis hunter standing and looking at these things would have seen a canopy of fire as these things came in and exploded," said Allen West, a geophysicist and one of the paper's co-authors. "There would have been no sound. There would have been massive explosions. Brilliant light, brighter than the sun. There would have been radiant heat -- it would have been capable, at the very least, of giving him serious burns and, at the maximum, of incinerating him."LiNeBrEaKThe hypothesis of a catastrophic impact at the start of the Younger Dryas has incited abundant skepticism in the scientific community. NASA space scientist David Morrison, an expert  on impacts, said he doubts that a comet could have broken up in the manner proposed by the Kennett group.LiNeBrEaK"They talk rather blithely about a comet disintegrating in the atmosphere," Morrison said. Referring to the nanodiamonds, he said:  "They may have discovered something absolutely marvelous and unexplained. But the impact hypothesis just doesn't make sense."LiNeBrEaKMorrison posed several questions: "What size impact does it take to produce diamonds? What size crater would that be? Where is it? If it hit in the ocean, would it have had the same effect? These are all questions one can ask."LiNeBrEaKKennett's father and co-author, James Kennett, an earth scientist at the University of California at Santa Barbara who has devoted much of his career to studying the Younger Dryas, said:  "I think it's totally reasonable that there should be skeptics. What we're arguing is that this impact hypothesis explains three major things that have been enigmatic and not particularly resolvable."LiNeBrEaKThose three things are the extinction of the megafauna, the disappearance of the Clovis culture and the climate change of the Younger Dryas. The general thought has been that climate change played a key role in wiping out the large animals and perhaps undermining the Clovis people, though some scientists have argued that the animals were hunted to extinction (the Pleistocene overkill hypothesis). But the fossil record has been puzzling, for many species of megafauna had survived multiple ice ages until the cool spell of the Younger Dryas.LiNeBrEaKFor decades, scientists have believed that meltwater at the end of the ice ages formed a huge lake in central North America, known to scientists as Lake Agassiz. At some point, the water from that lake may have surged into the North Atlantic and shut down the dominant ocean current that brought warmer water toward higher latitudes. That, in turn, could have created a long-term climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe impact scenario incorporates the meltwater scenario. The scientists say that the impact could have destabilized and melted the edges of the ice sheet resting on the northern tier of the continent. An impact would also have created a short-term environmental disaster. Dust from the impact and soot from continent-spanning wildfires could have risen into the atmosphere, blocked sunlight and dramatically hampered plant growth. With vast portions of the landscape burned, large animals requiring a great deal of food may have died off, even if they had survived the initial catastrophe.LiNeBrEaKThe younger Kennett acknowledged that work must be done to firm up the claim: "It's a hypothesis. . . . Basically, there's a suite of data that suggest that something like this occurred, but it still needs to be tested."

Albuquerque Journal (New Mexico) 	January 1, 2009 Thursday 	You May See Trash, But Owners Call It Home;  More Embrace Self-Sufficient Earthships 	FRONT PAGE; Pg. A1  	1798 words  	Asculpture made out of trash might be the way that Kathy Baur would describe her earthship home.LiNeBrEaK"To me the concept of using cans, tires, anything you can recycle and make look pretty again was such a low profile way of building. I fell in love with the total concept immediately," Baur said.LiNeBrEaKMore and more people are buying into the principles of an earthship home: a home that relies on concepts of green building to balance economic needs and the environmental impact using traditional and modern techniques. Construction materials vary from old tires packed with earth and adobe walls to high-tech photovoltaic solar panels. The perfect earthship, according to its adherents, is one that is completely self-sufficient.LiNeBrEaKAccording to information about green building on the state Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department Web site, "energy efficiency is the most cost-effective way to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions that lead to global warming." LiNeBrEaKNationally, the site says, buildings contribute up to half of greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKPeople in the Estancia Valley like Baur have committed to building homes that use fewer natural resources and require spending little or no money buying electricity or paying for water.LiNeBrEaKNo place like homeLiNeBrEaKOn a sunny day in late November, Baur stood on her rooftop and surveyed the 40 acres of land that she owns in Loma Parda west of Mountainair.LiNeBrEaKMountains and desert are about the only things that can be seen and about the only noise is the sound of a train whistle. It's a very solitary place.LiNeBrEaKAbout 15 years ago Baur sold her house, quit her job and moved to New Mexico from Denver to build a 2,500-square-foot earthship. She had read three books written by Michael Reynolds beginning with "Earthship: How to Build Your Own." Reynolds' concepts helped create a self-sufficient housing community made from recycled materials in Taos in northern New Mexico.LiNeBrEaK"I totally cashed in all my chips and just said, gulp, because I gave up an awful lot of material things. A house, a good job, retirement setup, the whole nine yards," Baur said.LiNeBrEaKBaur built her house almost single-handedly. She only hired technicians for complicated installations like the solar system and windows. She alone pounded all the dirt with a sledgehammer into 1,000 tires that form the structure of her home. Then she stacked the tires and placed them directly onto the ground. Some of the tires show through her mud or concrete walls. Gravity holds the tires, and her house, in place.LiNeBrEaKBefore she built her house, she built a well house or what she calls the "Baur Tower." It's a circular structure that surrounds her well and pump. She catches water on her roof but only uses it for watering plants. Her drinking water comes from her well.LiNeBrEaKBaur designed her home to use gray water. She pointed to a long trough in front of her south facing windows. "It's a garden space that you fill up with rocks and dirt and put plants in there. Then the water comes from the sink and bathtub and goes across the channel, and goes into a well. Then it gets picked up by a pump and gets recycled back through a toilet well. That means the water is getting used three times before it goes to septic," Baur said.LiNeBrEaKBaur opened the door into a dark room with a table that held many batteries for her photovoltaic power system.LiNeBrEaK"In here is the electric system. These are 360 amp deep cell batteries. This is how the energy gets stored during the day from the direct current solar panels. At night it slowly dissipates," Baur said.LiNeBrEaKShe doesn't really need to heat her earthship home, which is entirely off-the-grid. The temperature was over 71 degrees in the late afternoon last month. So warm in fact that Baur kept several windows open. The coolest her home has ever gotten is about 58 degrees. In fact last summer she built an overhang to shade her south-facing glass windows.LiNeBrEaK"Up in Taos they have to angle the windows. Down here it's so hot most of the time that you don't have to angle the glass," Baur said.LiNeBrEaKSaving energy,LiNeBrEaKselling energyLiNeBrEaKOn the other hand Bryan Pletta and Cristina Radu have built a house hooked up to the grid. Their house stands on a steep hill overlooking Cedar Crest. Although they live on a cul-desac, a forest of trees keeps them relatively isolated from their neighbors.LiNeBrEaKThe two sell the electricity they produce with a photovoltaic panel system on their roof to the Public Service Company of New Mexico.LiNeBrEaKThey also have a solar thermal system that uses flat plates to heat their 2,400 square foot home and their water.LiNeBrEaKAfter getting heated through the system the water is stored in a tank.LiNeBrEaK"The hot water is used in showers, sinks and laundry. It's also used to heat water that circulates through the floor in the radiant floor heating system," Pletta said.LiNeBrEaKBut it's still necessary on cloudy days to have a boiler for back up.LiNeBrEaKThey will know next month if they have built a truly zero energy home because their systems will have been in place for one year. A zero energy home produces as much energy as it consumes.LiNeBrEaKTwo meters link the home to PNM. One meter measures how much electricity is created by the panels. The other meter measures the power that PNM is taking, said Susan Sponar, PNM resources and corporate communications.LiNeBrEaK"For every hour created we pay 13 cents. If they create more than they use, then the meter spins backwards and we pay roughly 9 cents per hour," Sponar said.LiNeBrEaKPletta and Radu spent about $45,000 on their two roof systems.LiNeBrEaKThey also made sure their home got the most out of a very cheap energy source - the sun.LiNeBrEaK"We integrated the home to the landscape and built it oriented to the south for passive solar gain," Pletta said.LiNeBrEaKAnd there is no cooling system.LiNeBrEaK"We do it with windows. Passive solar not only heats but keeps cool in summer," Pletta said.LiNeBrEaKAlthough they have a wood stove, "the house pretty much heats itself," Pletta said.LiNeBrEaKPletta and Radu had their new house checked last month by Larry Gorman, from Building Energy Solutions.LiNeBrEaKGorman busied himself one day last month at their home installing a temporary fan in a door to perform an airtightness test.LiNeBrEaK"I'm going to suck the air out of the house," Gorman said as he punched numbers into a laptop computer that was connected to the fan.LiNeBrEaKThe test was the pressurized equivalent of a 20 mile-an-hour wind hitting all sides of the home and the roof, he said.LiNeBrEaKBefore performing the test Gorman handed Pletta an infrared camera so that the homeowner could look for leakage.LiNeBrEaKPletta walked around inside the house holding the camera up to his face and staring at the walls. Leaks appeared on the screen as black space. Airtight walls appeared on the screen as white.LiNeBrEaKThe test at Pletta's house cost about $340. It gave the home a Home Energy Rating System (HERS) index rating.LiNeBrEaKPletta also plans to get a certification through the Build Green NM rating system. Homeowners could also be certified through the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system.LiNeBrEaKThe state Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department issues a tax credit to homeowners that qualify based on the certification level and square footage of the residence, said Susie Marbury, energy efficiency and green building administrator.LiNeBrEaKPletta said he hopes to get a tax credit for about $10,000.LiNeBrEaKBuilding the perfectLiNeBrEaKhomeLiNeBrEaKChristian Meuli lives in a house made out of geometric shapes.LiNeBrEaKFour-sided parallelograms make up the sides of his 950-square-foot home in Edgewood about one mile away from Interstate 40.LiNeBrEaKThirty years ago at a show in Albuquerque, Meuli said he saw the home and liked it.LiNeBrEaK"So I bought it from the engineers who had built and designed it," Meuli said.LiNeBrEaKHe built his kit-home on a 10-sided foundation with the help of some friends. He is still finishing it by putting mud on the inside walls.LiNeBrEaK"The 20 panels bolted all together in one day. We used regular tools and cut windows before we put it up," Meuli said.LiNeBrEaKThe home was made at Zomeworks, an Albuquerque company founded by Steve Baer.LiNeBrEaKDuring the day the inside mud walls get warm when the sun hits them. During the evening they release the heat.LiNeBrEaKMeuli also has a high efficiency wood stove and a back-up propane tank. He collects wood from his 12 acres and dries it himself.LiNeBrEaK"I've never bought wood in 30 years," Meuli said.LiNeBrEaKHis limestone floor also heats his home, enough so that he can walk around barefoot in the winter time.LiNeBrEaKThe trick to keeping the house warm is to let the sunlight in, but don't let the heat back out, he said.LiNeBrEaKMeuli's house also has a 6,000-gallon cistern for collecting drinking water.LiNeBrEaK"The longer the water sits in the cistern, the cleaner it gets. The secret is to keep the sunlight out so that nothing can grow," Meuli said.LiNeBrEaKWorth the effortLiNeBrEaKBuilding an earthship may not be for everyone, but Baur, Pletta and Meuli all agree that even the smallest efforts can pay dividends, whether it's simply trying to reduce consumption or selling electricity back to the power company.LiNeBrEaKBecause they wanted to use recycled products, save money on heating and electricity, or just live less extravagantly, these homeowners would all agree that the time and expense they used building their homes was worth it.LiNeBrEaK"Everything is paid for. I didn't have to get a mortgage. I didn't have to buy anything until I got to the roof. All it cost me was labor," Baur said. Saving energy (and cash)LiNeBrEaKHere are some tips for homeowners to save money during the winter on high heating and electric bills, according to self-proclaimed house doctor Larry Gorman, from Building Energy Solutions.LiNeBrEaKn First, check for leaks in your house.LiNeBrEaKGorman said he uses clear caulk to seal cracks on the tops of doors and windows. Lighting fixtures can also be places for air leaks, he said.LiNeBrEaK"If you've got can lights in the ceiling they might have holes for insulation. The new cans are air tight and can safely be caulked to reduce air leakage," Gorman said.LiNeBrEaKn Second, seal up heating or air conditioning ducts that may be leaking.LiNeBrEaKAlthough it may sound simple, duct work in many New Mexican homes is in the ceiling, so it might not be an easy process, Gorman cautioned.LiNeBrEaKn Third, replace regular light bulbs with CFL (compact fluorescent light bulbs).LiNeBrEaK"They use about one third of the energy than an incandescent light bulb. It's a huge low-hanging fruit opportunity," Gorman said. n Fourth, turn off power strips.LiNeBrEaK"Computers, entertainment centers, anything that has a light that's glowing, that says it's on. They take up more energy than people realize," Gorman said.LiNeBrEaKn The doc's final tip is selfeducation.LiNeBrEaK"There's lots of resources on the Web. People need to realize the impact of their lifestyle on the environment and other people," Gorman said.LiNeBrEaKThe Web site for Building Energy Solutions is www.buildingenergysolutions.com.

The Augusta Chronicle (Georgia)  	January 1, 2009 Thursday 	The Augusta Chronicle, Ga., Scott Michaux column: Exciting year in sports will be difficult to match in 2009  	SPORTS  	755 words  	Jan. 1--Lock of the year: No way 2009 is as good as 2008.LiNeBrEaKThe last year in sports will be hard to match under the most ideal of circumstances. And these are not the most ideal of circumstances.LiNeBrEaKEveryone except the New York Yankees are feeling the economic pinch. In Augusta we've already lost a hockey franchise and a cycling encounter. Two PGA Tour stops, including the one in Atlanta, are gone. Even the gold-standard NFL experienced some internal downsizing. LiNeBrEaKIt's going to get worse -- a lot worse for some -- before it gets better. Hopefully it won't get as bad as 2007 (now that was a stinker of a sports year), but it will be a tough year.LiNeBrEaKWe'll have to stomach the Yankees buying themselves a World Series.LiNeBrEaKWe'll have to live with the Celtics creating another Boston dynasty (at least the Patriots and Red Sox won't win titles).LiNeBrEaKWe'll have to watch stars Knowshon Moreno and Matthew Stafford abandon Georgia prematurely for the pros.LiNeBrEaKWe'll have to suffer another year with the insufferable BCS.LiNeBrEaKWe'll have to listen to speculation about where and when Michael Vick will resurface after his time in the doghouse is served.LiNeBrEaKSo in honor of '09, here are the nine things I'd like to see to make the New Year almost as good as the old one:LiNeBrEaK1. After solving global warming, restoring peace in the Middle East and creating a green economy, President Obama will take on his biggest challenge yet by sending the administrators of the BCS to Guantanamo Bay and not letting them return until they've hammered out a legitimate playoff system to determine a true national college football champion.LiNeBrEaK2. Clemson basketball will pull off a stunning and historic first victory over No. 1 North Carolina in Chapel Hill, N.C., a triumph that will trigger the Tigers' momentum toward their first ACC Tournament championship and an appearance in the Final Four.LiNeBrEaK3. Augusta State and USC Aiken advance to the Division II Elite Eight in Springfield, Mass., where they'll reprise their Peach Belt Championship showdown and determine which one brings home a national championship.LiNeBrEaK4. Davis Love III wins the season-opening PGA Tour event at Kapalua to earn a return to the Masters Tournament, where he'll end up in a sudden death playoff with 54-year-old Greg Norman, thus ensuring that at least one of them will finally don the green jacket they each deserve. Tiger Woods, Sergio Garcia and Anthony Kim can divvy up the other three majors.LiNeBrEaK5. Dogwood Stable produces another horse worthy of a post position in the Kentucky Derby, and Cot Campbell finally gets to bring a blanket of roses back to Aiken to hang up next to Summer Squall's black-eyed Susans.LiNeBrEaK6. Thanks to a philanthropic donor who privately funds the building of a state-of-the-art, all-purpose arena in Augusta, the ECHL announces the return of the Lynx as the primary tenant. Boxers Paul Williams, Vernon Forrest and Ray Whitfield all vow to bring championship fights to the new facility.LiNeBrEaK7. Manager Bobby Cox and pitchers John Smoltz and Tom Glavine all announce that they will join Greg Maddux in retirement so they can start the countdown to the all-Braves Hall of Fame mega-induction ceremony in 2014. The wave of Braves-mania is so strong it carries Dale Murphy in with them.LiNeBrEaK8. Buoyed by an early season win over the Joe Cox-led Georgia Bulldogs and a late-season upset of Florida, South Carolina emerges from a three-way tie to win the SEC East and joins ACC champion Georgia Tech in the marquee bowl lineup by earning a trip to the Sugar Bowl. Every Gamecock except Stephen Garcia is allowed to celebrate on Bourbon Street.LiNeBrEaK9. Augusta National Golf Club chairman Billy Payne will announce that Asplundh has joined the list of major sponsors, sparking a massive course tree-trimming and restoration project under the guidance of two-time Masters winner and architectural purist Ben Crenshaw. The roars of approval will echo through the pines for years to come.LiNeBrEaKIt's a modest list of wishful thoughts for a new year with modest expectations. I'd gladly trade them all for peace on Earth.LiNeBrEaKHappy New Year.LiNeBrEaKReach Scott Michaux at (706) 823-3219 or scott.michaux@augustachronicle.com	SPORTS and RECREATION (91%); SPORTS (91%); SPORTS and RECREATION EVENTS (89%); TOURNAMENTS (89%); GOLF TOURNAMENTS (89%); GOLF (89%); BASEBALL (78%); BASKETBALL (78%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY SPORTS (78%); AMERICAN FOOTBALL (75%); CYCLING (71%); HORSE RACING (67%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  	BARACK OBAMA (54%); TIGER WOODS (50%)  	ATLANTA, GA, USA (88%); NEW YORK, NY, USA (88%); BOSTON, MA, USA (76%) NEW YORK, USA (92%); NORTH CAROLINA, USA (90%); GEORGIA, USA (88%); KENTUCKY, USA (79%); MASSACHUSETTS, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (92%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); CUBA (53%)  	January 2, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Augusta Chronicle   	Scott Michaux, The Augusta Chronicle, Ga.

The Augusta Chronicle (Georgia)  	January 1, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: How do things get so big?: We shouldn't let companies get "too big to fail" to begin with!  	COMMENTARY  	477 words  	Jan. 1--When both the markets and the economy went into collapse mode last fall, recall how Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, among others, understandably justified the financial industry rescue. LiNeBrEaKThey kept saying how some banking, investing and mortgage institutions were too large to let fail -- that if any one of them went under, they could bring down the entire industry and probably the economy as well.LiNeBrEaKTruth be known, the feared financial meltdown was like global warming: You weren't sure whether the dire warning were true, but it was too scary not to try to prevent.LiNeBrEaKIn short, something had to be done.LiNeBrEaKBut with the benefit of hindsight, it's instructive to now ask: Why did anything have to be done in the first place?LiNeBrEaKIn other words, how do things get so big that we can't allow them to fail?LiNeBrEaKAs a new administration prepares to take office, one wonders how to restore confidence in a regulatory regime that has failed the nation so badly. The answer, of course, isn't more regulations -- it's better regulations. Under some conditions, that could even mean fewer regulations.LiNeBrEaKFor instance, we don't need more regulations in hopes of keeping huge institutions in line so their collapse won't threaten to bring down an entire industry and damage the economy, thereby necessitating more mega-billion dollar bailouts.LiNeBrEaKRather, no private institution or corporation should ever be allowed to grow so huge that the rest of society can't afford to let it fail!LiNeBrEaKThat doesn't require more regulations; it requires commonsense application of antitrust laws. Break up the entities before they grow "too large to fail."LiNeBrEaKThis means putting a few reins on the "merger mania" that lets a handful of institutions swallow up a lot of smaller ones until they become too big, or too interconnected, to fail. The proper role of government isn't just to write rules and regulations, but to create a climate of fair and energetic competition that benefits both commerce and consumers.LiNeBrEaKCongress is doing exactly the wrong thing by trying to save Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant quasi-government institutions that contributed so mightily to the subprime mortgage catastrophe that triggered the ongoing economic turmoil. Those are the kind of institutions that the government should be breaking up and selling off -- not keeping afloat until the day comes again when they'll almost surely need another humongous taxpayer bailout.

The Baltimore Sun (Maryland)  	January 1, 2009 Thursday 	BSO celebrates King's 80th birthday with annual tribute concert  	ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  	718 words  	Jan. 1--The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. would have turned 80 on Jan. 15. Although the challenge of defeating discrimination and bigotry -- and not just racial -- remains formidable, the slain civil rights leader would have been astounded at the changes in the world, especially what's taking shape in Washington.LiNeBrEaKSo this year's observance of King's birthday cannot help but seem more important, and the State of Maryland's 23rd Annual Tribute Concert with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra cannot help but seem even more of a celebratory occasion. LiNeBrEaKBSO music director Marin Alsop will conduct the concert, which includes a vivid work inspired by King's life and struggles, New Morning for the World, by Joseph Schwantner.LiNeBrEaKThis 1982 score for narrator and orchestra incorporates some of King's speeches. The narrator for this performance will be Kweisi Mfume, former president of the NAACP.LiNeBrEaKAlso on the program will be Global Warming, a 1991 work by Michael Abels. Despite its title, the music is not concerned with the scientific issue of climate change, but the possibilities of warmer relations between races and cultures. (Joseph Young, the first BSO-Peabody Conducting Fellow and recipient of the 2008 Sir Georg Solti Foundation Career Grant, will conduct this piece.)LiNeBrEaKMusic by Soulful Symphony founder Darin Atwater and Richard Smallwood's Total Praise will also be performed.LiNeBrEaKThe Baltimore City College Choir will sing some a cappella selections and also join the BSO for some parts of the show.LiNeBrEaKThe King tribute will be performed at 8 p.m. Wednesday at Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, 1212 Cathedral St., and 8 p.m. Jan. 8 at the Music Center at Strathmore, 5301 Tuckerman Lane, North Bethesda. Tickets are $15 to $55. Call 410-783-8000 or go to bsomusic.org.LiNeBrEaKThe Lyric, still openLiNeBrEaKWhen the Baltimore Opera Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 4, some people seemed to think the Lyric Opera House, where the company's productions were presented, was bankrupt, too. The board of trustees for the Lyric Foundation, which operates the theater, wants everyone to know that the venue is unaffected by the opera company's troubles.LiNeBrEaKThe foundation also would like to remind people to contact Baltimore Opera (410-625-1600), and not the Lyric, with any questions or concerns about that company.LiNeBrEaK"We are very saddened by the situation" at Baltimore Opera, Edward J. Brody, chair of the Lyric Foundation board, said in a statement. "We will help in any way we can because Baltimore City is a major center for musical arts in the U.S., and grand opera is a cornerstone of that long-standing tradition." Brody is a former president of Baltimore Opera.LiNeBrEaKThe Lyric, one of the largest creditors listed in the opera company's bankruptcy filing (it is owed more than $200,000), will continue presenting its own entertainment programming, as it has for many years.LiNeBrEaKMusical chairsLiNeBrEaKDeborah Goetz, longtime senior director of marketing and communications for the Baltimore Opera Company, will move a couple of blocks down the street to take on the newly created position of senior director of marketing for the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra this month.LiNeBrEaKThe departure of Goetz from Baltimore Opera after 13 years does not send a particularly heartening signal about that bankrupt company's future. She has been such a key figure in the organization's activities that it will be hard for some people to imagine Baltimore Opera without her. Then again, it's hard to imagine Baltimore Opera ever bouncing back with much of the same management in place.LiNeBrEaKAs for the company's prospects of recovery, general manager M. Kevin Wixted told me last week, "We're moving along. We are going to get this solved."LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, back at the BSO, Eileen Andrews Jackson has been named vice president for marketing and communications, an expanded role for her. She started as vice president for public relations and community affairs in 2005.

The Boston Globe 	January 1, 2009 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	Consider the global climate along with business climate  	NORTHWEST; Pg. Reg3  	168 words  	GLOBE NORTHWEST 1 / LettersLiNeBrEaKYour article about Burlington's new 4. 6-million-square-foot mixed-use development ("Burlington project aims to shed office park image," Globe NorthWest, Dec. 25) mentions "market climate" and "business climate" a few times, but neglects the most important climate issue - that of global climate change. LiNeBrEaKAny development, whether residential, commercial, or industrial, should be held to the highest environmental standards, and use as little fossil fuel energy as possible. The planet is heating up rapidly, with recent studies showing that continuing on the unsustainable "business as usual" path rather than reducing our emissions will result in rising seas and catastrophic climate change.LiNeBrEaKWe must demand that our leaders create policies that result in sustainable growth and reduced emissions. Sustainable development results in a better quality of life for our children and their children.

The Boston Globe 	January 1, 2009 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	Nine wishes for 2009  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A18  	1386 words  	FEW New Year's Days have been imbued with as much hope as this dawning of 2009. No doubt the fervent finger-crossing is so great because it matches the level of national anxiety, especially about the teetering economy. But today, with a year of possibility stretched out before us like pristine snow, is a time for optimism. So we offer these nine good wishes for 2009, in hopes of a better world - from the Globe's backyard to places far outside the circulation area. LiNeBrEaK1. We wish strength and wisdom for Barack Obama. The president-elect has an In box overflowing with challenges. We hope he keeps his head while navigating the perilous interest-group politics that his election has not banished from Washington. The immense goodwill greeting this historic presidency needs to be harnessed to propel the nation out of the current desolating recession, with its rippling job losses, housing foreclosures, and credit freezes. States and cities, where services for the neediest are dispensed, are facing extreme budget shortfalls of their own and require a boost from Washington. But Obama and his advisers need to take care, when dispensing the crucial billions in stimulus dollars, not to turn balm into boondoggle. Meanwhile, there needs to be accountability for the banks, Wall Street sharpies, and federal officials who allowed years of economic voodoo in the mortgage and financial markets to bloom into this crisis.LiNeBrEaK2. We wish for a lively, respectful challenge to Mayor Menino. This fall the mayor is almost certainly going to stand for an unprecedented fifth term as chief executive of our beloved city, and he should not get a free ride. Much as we support the mayor on many initiatives, there is always room for new ideas and fresh thinking. After almost 16 years with Menino in office, progress in Boston is only halting on crime reduction, education, civic engagement, and downtown development. It is time for a serious evaluation. We hope Menino doesn't adopt a Rose Garden strategy and avoid engaging his potential opponents; there should be plenty of debates, especially if the preliminary campaign draws more than one challenger, which we also hope for. In addition, there is a good chance that two or three City Council seats will open up this year, and we hope to see new candidates step up to run - inspired by Obama's example, perhaps - from the city's many communities of color.LiNeBrEaK3. We hope the temperature keeps turned up on global warming action. The Obama administration may be tempted to put the issue of climate change on the back burner while it copes with the economy. It should not, because the United States must lead if the world is to agree in 2009 on a successor to the expiring Kyoto protocol. If the new president presses the issue, Congress should finally have the votes to put a tax on carbon or create a cap-and-trade system on emissions. And there is a way to keep either measure from burdening the economic recovery: return the revenues from a carbon tax or from the sale of emission allowances to the public in the form of reduced personal taxes or more immediate investments in green technology. Obama's campaign talked about investing $15 billion a year for 10 years on green technologies, an amount dwarfed by the financial bailouts and economic stimulus plans of the past few months. The way to get consumers to choose more sustainable energy alternatives is to make them ubiquitous - and affordable.LiNeBrEaK4. We hope ethical government makes a comeback. From bucolic towns such as Hamilton to Boston City Hall and Beacon Hill, far too many public officials been found - allegedly - with their hands in the till. Governor Patrick's anti-corruption task force needs to come up with more than obvious quick-fix solutions such as increasing fines for violators. A good start for the next legislative session would be a cold-eyed look at the state and municipal pension systems, which have been tarred by high-profile abuses. And Patrick should more actively champion clean government. It is possible to defend public service as an honorable calling while showing no tolerance for corruption. In fact, the two go hand in hand.LiNeBrEaK5. The ethical cloud hanging over the Legislature will complicate the intricate dance needed to pass important policy changes. But we hope Beacon Hill finds the will to address the state's transportation crisis. The expected federal stimulus package, large as it is, will not be sufficient to address the $19 billion in deferred maintenance on the state's roads, bridges, and rails, nor all of the $4. 7 billion in "shovel-ready" plans on Patrick's own wish list. Especially crucial in hard times is a functioning public transportation system, and the MBTA is a woeful mess. Transportation will be Patrick's priority issue for 2009. It is time for him to lead the Legislature toward sanity and equity in transportation funding by raising the gasoline tax for the first time in 18 years - and by enough to make it count.LiNeBrEaK6. The planets at last seem to be aligning for significant national progress on universal health insurance. So we hope the state's landmark healthcare law survives the fiscal storm. The recession is cutting state revenues needed to subsidize both the newly insured themselves and the hospitals and community health centers that treat disproportionate numbers of low-income patients. Layoffs will also increase the ranks of those who lose work-based coverage and need the state-subsidized programs. If the state's experiment is to serve as a national model, it must demonstrate that it is not just a fair-weather solution to the nation's healthcare ills. It's good news that Obama understands that healthcare costs are intimately tied to the economic health of American business, and that reforming the system cannot wait until the economy recovers. Universal coverage, properly designed, can do more for the nation's health than all the usual vain New Year's resolutions to stop eating cookies after lunch.LiNeBrEaK7. We hope for peace in the world. It will take more than a single year for the new president to undo the damage done to America's standing in the world by his predecessor's policies. But since governing is about putting first things first, there are some knots we would like to see undone in 2009. Most urgent is the need for renewed engagement in the Middle East, where a hot war has started in Gaza. The most promising areas may be North Korea's nuclear program and an American-brokered peace between Israel and Syria. At the same time, we would be cheered to see a dialogue opened with Iran, the lowering of tensions between Pakistan and India, and a fresh start for US-Russia relations. That would be a good year for the home team.LiNeBrEaK8. We hope Greater Boston's public institutions become better neighbors. Lately it seems that hospitals and universities are the only places around that are expanding. Increasingly, these tax-exempt stalwarts are city-builders, reshaping whole neighborhoods - architecturally and culturally - into new institutional zones. While no one doubts the value of education and healthcare, and the substantial employment opportunities that come with their success, we hope local colleges and medical centers will take a closer look at how their master plans line up with their charitable missions. That means Boston College thinks twice about forcing an unwelcome dormitory expansion plan into residential Brighton; Harvard continues close dialogue with community leaders as it builds its life sciences campus in Allston; and the great hospital network operated by Partners HealthCare recognizes the impact its muscular expansion into the suburbs is having on community hospitals.LiNeBrEaK9. We wish for a re-setting of national values. We don't want to romanticize hard economic times. The recession hurts real people's current lives and strangles their futures. But we are hoping for a corrective balance to the profligacy of the past decade, built on an unsustainable tower of national and personal debt. New Year's is traditionally a time for personal introspection. This year, more than most, it is fitting to redefine needs and wants, to nurture friendships, take solace from the arts or the natural world, and delight in what is right in front of us instead of grasping for what's out of reach. We hope that helps.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 1, 2009 Thursday 	Scientists say comet killed off mammoths, saber-toothed tigers  	INTERNATIONAL NEWS  	751 words  	CHICAGO _ First an explosion as powerful as thousands of megatons of TNT rained meteorites down on North America. Then forest fires broke out across the continent, sending up a thick layer of soot and dust that blocked out the sun. A sudden ice age ensued, and some of the Earth's largest animals went extinct in a blink of geological time.LiNeBrEaKIt's well known that a meteorite colliding with Earth is considered the most likely reason dinosaurs died off 65 million years ago. Now a team of scientists says it has found new evidence that a comet triggered a similar extinction much more recently: just 13,000 years ago, when humans were around to witness the event and suffer its terrible consequences. LiNeBrEaKThe researchers also think that when the comet exploded above the planet's surface _ ultimately killing off mammoths, saber-toothed tigers and other large mammals that roamed North America _ Chicago wasn't too far from ground zero.LiNeBrEaK"If you'd been in Chicago back in that time, it would've been one very bad day," said Allen West, an Arizona geophysicist and one of the authors of a paper appearing Friday in the journal Science.LiNeBrEaKThe scientists, led by University of Oregon anthropologist Douglas Kennett, say their report offers up a "smoking bullet" _ proof it was a comet that set off the sudden, thousand-year freeze and wiped out the big animals of the era.LiNeBrEaKWorking at multiple sites across the continent, researchers found nanodiamonds _ microscopic particles thought to be found on comets _ in a 13,000-year-old layer of rich sedimentary soil called a "black mat." Beneath the layer with the nanodiamonds, fossils of the animals are abundant. After that layer, they disappear, West said.LiNeBrEaK"It's extraordinary that tens of millions of animals disappeared synchronously at exactly the time when the diamonds and carbon layer are laid down across the continent," said West, whose co-authors include DePaul University chemist Wendy Wolbach.LiNeBrEaKArrowheads and other artifacts from the Clovis culture of humans _ an early hunter-gatherer society _ also vanish after the black mat was laid down 13,000 years ago.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, West and a team of scientists published an analysis of black mats from several regions that found heavy metals, soot and charcoal suggestive of meteorite impacts and subsequent fires. The new report says the discovery of nanodiamonds in the same material is more evidence of a cosmic strike.LiNeBrEaKArcheologists have long speculated about whether climate change or over-hunting drove the mammoths, tigers and other "megafauna" to extinction and led to the decline of the Clovis culture.LiNeBrEaKMany remain skeptical of the comet theory and think there may be better explanations for what happened, said Daniel Amick, an associate professor of anthropology at Loyola University who studies the Clovis culture.LiNeBrEaK"When most archeologists heard about it they were somewhat dismissive," Amick said. "We would think, 'How in the world could we have missed this? How could this spectacular kind of event have occurred and never even dawned on us?'"LiNeBrEaKThe authors have much to prove before their theory is accepted, Amick said, like pinpointing the date of the event and ruling out other potential causes of extinction and climate change.LiNeBrEaKIn response to one common criticism of the comet theory _ that no craters have been found from an impact _ West said the comet may not have actually reached Earth, but exploded into fragments somewhere above the surface.LiNeBrEaKWhere exactly that might have happened is a mystery, but high concentrations of nanodiamonds at a site in Eastern Michigan suggest the Great Lakes as a possibility.LiNeBrEaK"We think that Chicago might well have been very near ground zero," West said.LiNeBrEaKThe idea that a comet may have caused catastrophic climate change and extinction relatively recently in Earth's long history suggests scientists shouldn't dismiss the possibility of it happening again, Wolbach said.LiNeBrEaK"Should we be doing more to try to deflect future asteroids, or is that too sci-fi?" she said. "If this is true and there was an impact 12. 9 thousand years ago, obviously this is not something that's just a theoretical idea, it's a real thing."

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 1, 2009 Thursday 	For many, drinking less is a New Year's resolution  	MY TOWN; Alameda; News; Local; Entertainment; Dining; Restaurants; Reviews  	708 words  	For some, those New Year's resolutions are fading about as fast as the Jan. 1 hangover. Others are sticking to their guns.LiNeBrEaKThe top choices among Americans for remodeling their lives revolve around weight, money and bad habits, according to the U.S. government's Web site, www.usa.gov .  Quitting smoking has lost ground, but there are still plenty of drinkers out there. The smart ones waited until after the holidays to do what is politely called "drink less."LiNeBrEaKSobriety in November and December is about as good an idea as a Thanksgiving diet   No. 1 on the list of resolutions is losing weight. Booze seems nearly as pervasive as candy used to be at holiday parties. In fact, now we suck down cocktails that taste like candy with names like lemon drop. LiNeBrEaK"The best current investment advice is to drink heavily and recycle. It's called the 401-Keg," according to a joke circulating on the Web.LiNeBrEaKForget real estate. I'm putting my bucks in booze. Alcohol and coffee are not entirely recession resistant, but more than half of Americans say they drink alcohol, a percentage that has varied little in the last 10 years, according to a 2008 Gallup Poll. They guzzle $197 million worth of alcohol each day. That's good for someone's business.LiNeBrEaKEven the solution to global warming might be found at the bottom of a martini glass: A recent study found the average American walks about 900 miles a year. Another study found Americans drink, on average, 22 gallons of alcohol a year. That means Americans get about 41 miles to the gallon of ethanol   on average. I found the same calculation applied to Canadians. We both get nearly the gas mileage than a Toyota Prius.LiNeBrEaKEthanol is the pure alcohol content in any drink, named ironically by Arab chemists who perfected distillation, which produced a liquid they compared to mascara in Arabic, al-koh'l   according to "Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol."LiNeBrEaKHooch historians long have known that we've always been a hard-drinking country. That includes a massive binge between 1790 and 1830, which W.J. Rorabough, author of "The Alcoholic Republic," called a key formative period in our history. During that time, everyone drank   men, women, children, politicians, clergy, judges and juries. That might explain a lot of things if the founding fathers were stewed when they were putting this country together. (By the way, I just found out how few jokes there are about the U.S. Constitution.)LiNeBrEaKMore recently, the average drinker reported to Gallup pollsters having consumed 3. 8 alcoholic drinks in the past week   the first time the average has dropped below four drinks since 2001. It had been as high as 5. 1 in 2003.LiNeBrEaKNow, bear in mind that the Centers for Disease Control defines heavy drinking as more than one drink per day for women, and an average of more than two drinks per day for men. A drink is one 12-ounce bottle of beer; 8 ounces of malt liquor; a 5-ounce glass of wine; or one 1 1/2-ounce shot of liquor. Whoa "... before I thought three glasses of wine was moderate.LiNeBrEaKAlcohol, it turns out, depresses nerve cells in the brain and body. Stimulation occurs to compensate for the imbalance. So low doses of alcohol cause people to feel high, while higher doses cause sedation and sleepiness.LiNeBrEaKOne of the strangest things about being a nondrinker is that you might start feeling like a lush because drinkers can't seem to fathom why anyone would stop boozing short of alcoholism. That said, I can't tell if it's the season or a sign of our times that I've seen numerous articles lately about people drinking too much (women more than men; men more than women, etc.) or about alcohol moderation.LiNeBrEaKOur financial situation might be catching up with our wallets   or just our livers. For those who are resolved to give it a rest, StopDrinkingAdvice.org . recommends making a list of all the reasons you want to drink less, and then set a goal of how much you will drink.LiNeBrEaKDecide, before you start imbibing, exactly how many rounds you will have. Sure, Shirley Temples don't have the same sex appeal as a round of cosmopolitans. But you'll remember what you did after you drink them.LiNeBrEaKThat's all for now, ladies and gentlemen.

Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, California)  	January 1, 2009 Thursday 	Transit blunders and bouquets of 2008  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1053 words  	Jan. 1--Real estate plummeted, banks crashed and unemployment soared, but as the Bay Area watched house prices, credit ratings and job security go down the drain, at least one thing went right: 2008 was a Public Transit Party.LiNeBrEaKPeople hopped the bus, jumped the train and caught the BART in record-breaking numbers, sparing the environment and their wallets in the face of high gas prices. As a final coup, voters passed Prop. 1A, authorizing $9. 95 billion to construct a statewide high-speed rail in November. Of course, it wasn't all gravy, but overall, transit rocked and rolled. LiNeBrEaKHere's the rundown on the best and worst moments of the year. The envelope, please:LiNeBrEaKIn the public transit highlight of 2008, demonstrating a truly heroic commitment to public transportation, Jessica Bennett walked seven blocks to the south Hayward BART station Nov. 21 to get to the hospital to have her baby.LiNeBrEaKOr rather, she tried to, but baby Jada had other ideas, and Bennett gave birth shortly afterward at the San Leandro station.LiNeBrEaKBART spokesman Linton Johnson described this as his personal high point of the year, but did not comment whether Bennett was charged an additional fare for the baby.LiNeBrEaKAnd speaking of increasing ridership, after decades of unsuccessfully begging, wooing, seducing and cajoling commuters to eschew their cars, transit agencies scored like rock stars in 2008. Like high school boys getting lucky for the first time, they couldn't stopLiNeBrEaKtalking about it, issuing copious press releases and competing over who was getting the most (riders, that is).LiNeBrEaKTurns out the Capitol Corridor train running between Sacramento (well, Auburn, to be exact) and San Jose is the No. 1 Public Transit Stud for 2008, racking up a 33 percent increase in ridership this July, to 161,731 passengers.LiNeBrEaK"That smashed all previous records and I don't think there's any other transit system in the Bay Area that can match that," gloated Luna Salaver, who acts as a spokeswoman for both the Capitol Corridor and BART.LiNeBrEaK"From that 33 percent we calculated those riders prevented 6,020 pounds of smog pollutants and 3,922 pounds of greenhouse gases just in the month of July."LiNeBrEaKThe County Connection saw ridership increases of at least 10 percent a month every month in 2008, according to General Manager Rick Ramacier, with a 24 percent jump in September.LiNeBrEaKThough the rate slowed in the fall, average weekday ridership on BART grew all year, hitting 370,502 passengers in Contra Costa, Alameda, San Francisco and Solano counties in October.LiNeBrEaK"Bay Area residents showed characteristic flexibility and resilience in the face of high gas prices during the first half of 2008, resulting in record ridership on BART, a big shift to carpooling and widespread use of public transportation," said John Goodwin of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a Bay Area planning agency for roads and transit.LiNeBrEaKAs to the low points, in a cruel irony, just as thousands flocked to public transit, agencies saw their funds slashed by the state.LiNeBrEaK"When you succeed, you're supposed to be rewarded, not punished," observed Ramacier. "We've lost about $3 million in this year's 2008 budget alone and that's on top of losses in three of the last four years." The cuts forced the County Connection to raise fares and reduce service. BART and AC Transit also saw their funding drop.LiNeBrEaKDespite budget worries, commuters came through at the ballot box.LiNeBrEaK"The No. 1 (moment) is voters' continued support for transit such as the high-speed rail, BART to San Jose, SMART and the AC Transit operating fund increase," said Goodwin.LiNeBrEaKThis is similar to the Great Depression of the 1930s, when voters had the foresight to vote for projects like the Golden Gate Bridge, the Caldecott Tunnel and the Bay Bridge.LiNeBrEaKThe four projects will make it easier to avoid AC Transit rate increases, not to mention the dreaded commute to San Jose from the East Bay, Highway 101 traffic and the dreary drive to Los Angeles via Interstate Highway 5.LiNeBrEaKNearly 72 percent of voters in the area served by AC Transit actually voted to double their own parcel taxes to stave off AC Transit rate hikes, effective Jan. 1. Those voters approved Measure VV, doubling a parcel tax from $48 to $96 a year in almost all of the district.LiNeBrEaKAC Transit board members and transit advocates said passage of the measure was necessary to cover higher operating costs and forestall fare increases or service cuts.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, residents of Marin and Sonoma counties got SMART, also known as the Sonoma"&Acirc;Marin Area Rail Transit project. Voters in those counties approved Measure Q, which involved plans for a passenger train and pathway project connecting the wine country to San Francisco Bay.LiNeBrEaKWhile Marin and Sonoma counties got SMART, Silicon Valley commuters got BART, or at least some help in that direction. Voters in Santa Clara County approved Measure B, which increases their sales tax by one-eighth of a cent to raise money for a long-planned BART project expanding service from Fremont to San Jose.LiNeBrEaKOn the downside, this was a long time in coming and the recent measure won't go into effect until an agreement is reached on federal funding. Still, it's progress.LiNeBrEaKAnd, speaking of progress, the crown jewel of these projects is the high-speed rail, designated, fittingly enough, Proposition 1A in the November election. Bullet trains zooming up to 220 mph will link San Francisco and Los Angeles in as little as two and a half hours if and when the project is completed. The approximately 800-mile system would also serve Sacramento, San Jose, Fresno and San Diego.LiNeBrEaKIt's worth noting that this year's high points all stemmed from commuters: Higher ridership, funds for new projects and, of course, literally bringing new life to public transit courtesy of Jessica Bennett. Only time will tell whether 2009 will top these highs and lows.LiNeBrEaKReach Janis Mara at 925-952-2671 or jmara@bayareanewsgroup.com	URBAN TRANSIT SYSTEMS (90%); PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION (90%); OIL and GAS PRICES (78%); EMISSIONS (76%); AIR POLLUTION (76%); CLIMATE CHANGE (76%); HIGH SPEED TRAINS (72%); SMOG (71%); HOME PRICES (78%)  		SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (95%); SACRAMENTO, CA, USA (79%); SAN JOSE, CA, USA (79%); SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (95%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	January 2, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 Contra Costa Times   	Janis Mara, Contra Costa Times, Walnut Creek, Calif.

The Daily News of Newburyport (Massachusetts)  	January 1, 2009 Thursday 	Storm caps near record-setting year Third highest precipitation in Newburyport history  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	506 words  	Jan. 1--NEWBURYPORT-- On New Year's Day 2008, a small blanket of snow fell on Greater Newburyport.LiNeBrEaKIt was the start of a deluge that made 2008 the third wettest on record. LiNeBrEaKYesterday, as 6 to 8 inches dropped on Greater Newburyport, it closed out a year in which 63. 2 inches of precipitation has fallen, coming in a close third to 1983 with 66. 39 inches and 2006's all-time record of 68. 75 inches.LiNeBrEaK"Some people would attribute this to global warming, but I think it has more to do with weather patterns we have encountered this year," said Ray Whitley of Salisbury, an observer for the National Weather Service.LiNeBrEaKHis records show the area receiving well above the average precipitation expectations for six months of this year. February, March, June, July, September and December all well exceeded the average of 3. 5 inches a month. On average, New England has 42 inches of precipitation a year.LiNeBrEaKThis year has proven to be what Whitley describes as a typical New England year -- translation: Weather is unpredictable.LiNeBrEaK"It's up, it's down, it's all over the place," Whitley said.LiNeBrEaKDecember has broken two records with 22 inches of snow falling. That's well above the average 12 inches. And the temperature reached 60 degrees on Dec. 15, breaking the 1971 record of 56 degrees.LiNeBrEaK"The few warm days and light snow have helped with snow removal," Whitley said. "If the snow gets heavy and wet, there could be issues, but so far we are safe."LiNeBrEaKWhitley also said the Dec. 12 ice storm was unexpected for this time of the year. The ice storm left thousands in the area without power for days.LiNeBrEaK"If this pattern continues, we will end up getting more precipitation," Whitley said. "If January and February are both cold, we will continue to have snow."LiNeBrEaKThe 2009 Farmer's Almanac is predicting a snowier winter. According to the Almanac, the early snow is indicative of a nationwide cold winter on the way.LiNeBrEaK"Most regions will have below-normal winter temperatures on average, with the heaviest snowfall extending from the Ozarks northeastward into southern New England," according to the book.LiNeBrEaKThe Almanac has predicted weather since 1792 and claims it is traditionally 80 percent accurate. In the 2008 edition, the forecasted winter temperatures were within one degree of actual temperatures.LiNeBrEaK"I trust the National Weather Service," Whitley said. "But the Almanac is never too far off."LiNeBrEaKLooking forward to the new year, there two storms expected to hit the area this weekend.LiNeBrEaKExceptional 2008 RainfallLiNeBrEaKAverage monthly precipitation is 3. 5 inches.LiNeBrEaKFebruary 8. 96 inchesLiNeBrEaKMarch 6. 35 inchesLiNeBrEaKJune 4. 92 inchesLiNeBrEaKJuly 7. 25 inchesLiNeBrEaKSeptember 8. 99 inches	WEATHER (90%); NON FICTION LITERATURE (85%); CLIMATOLOGY (75%); GLOBAL WARMING (75%)  		NORTHEAST USA (91%); MASSACHUSETTS, USA (78%) UNITED STATES (91%)  	January 2, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009    	Sabrina Cardin, The Daily News of Newburyport, Mass.

Daily Press (Newport, Virginia)  	January 1, 2009 Thursday 	Daily Press, Newport News, Va., Diggin' In column: A perfect ground covering  	LIFESTYLE  	674 words  	Jan. 1--Cold weather brings out the best in an eye-catching native ground cover known as partridge-berry -- botanically called Mitchella repens.LiNeBrEaK"It's one of the most adaptable and easy-to-grow ground covers for the home gardener in the Southeast," says Helen Hamilton, president of the John Clayton Chapter, Virginia Native Plant Society.LiNeBrEaKPartridge-berry displays edible, tasteless berries 10 months of the year. It's a creeping, delicate vine that does not climb and is often covered by fallen leaves, says Helen. It transplants easily and grows quickly but rarely becomes a pest. LiNeBrEaKIn late spring, the plant bears paired white flowers at the tip of each shoot. The flowers open their four-petal buds. At flowering time, the two flowers are already partially fused. Both flowers must be pollinated to produce the red "double berry" that stays on the vine until after blooms appear in spring.LiNeBrEaK"Look closely and you will be able to see on the top of the 'double-berry' the scars marking the attachment of both flowers," she says.LiNeBrEaKAlso known as "twinberry," the plant is evergreen, and grows well in rich, dappled shade. It most often occurs on small knolls in the woodlands.LiNeBrEaKSwedish botanist Carl Linnaeus named the plant Mitchella for his friend John Mitchell, who was a resident of Urbanna on the Middle Peninsula. Mitchell was a physician, naturalist and plant lover. "Repens" refers to the plant's trailing or creeping growth pattern. Visit www.claytonvnps.org for more information about native plants; visit www.vnps.org/nurslist for a list of nurseries that sell native plants.LiNeBrEaKALMANAC ADVICELiNeBrEaKDan McMurry and his family consume 1,500 to 2,000 pounds of tomatoes that he annually grows from seed in a 1-acre garden in Canada. His secrets for growing great tomatoes -- mulch, manure and no pruning -- are outlined in the '09 Farmer's Almanac.LiNeBrEaKThe 250-page publication, available at local hardware and garden stores, also features how to get "butterflies for free" when you plant milkweed in your yard.LiNeBrEaKIf you're not into gardening, you'll still like the almanac for its articles about fashion, food, global warming, trout fishing and tips for living to be 100.LiNeBrEaKWeather-wise, the almanac says our Hampton Roads summer will be cooler than normal, despite a warm June. Rainfall is expected to be good -- good news after several years of drought. Learn more at www.almanac.com.LiNeBrEaKTHINGS TO DOLiNeBrEaK--Free Pruning Lessons.

Daily Oklahoman  	January 1, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: Resolutions suggested as another year begins: Our ViewsHappy New Year  	COMMENTARY  	511 words  	Jan. 1--PROSIT Neujahr! Prospero Ano Neuvo! Bonne Annee! Happy New Year!LiNeBrEaKIn whatever language, speak now of your une bonne resolution, as the French would call a New Year's resolution. Below are some suggestions: LiNeBrEaKGov. Brad Henry: Resolve to reflect the traits you liked in Barack Obama as a unifier and "post-partisan" leader. That means ditching past partisan stances on tort reform and workers' compensation system reform.LiNeBrEaKBarack Obama: Resolve to govern as the unifier and "post-partisan" leader you claimed you'd be during the campaign. America's problems require a break from intense partisanship.LiNeBrEaKPresident Bush: Resolve to enjoy the post-White House years in Dallas or at your ranch or wherever. History is likely to see your presidency in a different light than the one that drove your approval ratings to historic lows in 2008.LiNeBrEaKGOP legislative leaders: Resolve to put the people before partisanship. Don't treat the Democrats the way they treated you!LiNeBrEaKOklahoma City Thunder: Resolve to win at least two games a month.LiNeBrEaKBob Stoops: Resolve to win a game -- any game -- in the month of January. Seriously, resolve to have your team ready to play a week from tonight, when the Sooners take on Florida for the BCS national title.LiNeBrEaKSen. Tom Coburn: Resolve to resolve the earmark problem by resolute determination to keep fighting the good fight.LiNeBrEaKSen. Jim Inhofe: Resolve to be humble as the global warming house of cards continues collapsing. You can always say, "I told you so." Instead, be warm to the greenies as they come staggering in from the cold.LiNeBrEaKOklahoma Education Association: Resolve to embrace one school reform proposal for every funding gimmick you trot out in the new year.LiNeBrEaKTulsa leaders: Resolve to embrace the old Avis slogan: We Try Harder! Being No. 2 ain't half bad. Also, don't bury any Plymouths unless you spring for the undercoating charge from the dealer.LiNeBrEaKState officials: Resolve to assess the state's assets to see whether some can be leveraged to help fund future obligations. Start with our abundant excess water.LiNeBrEaKMayor Mick Cornett: Resolve to continue using your skills to push Oklahoma City forward. You've been a terrific voice for our community during nearly five years on the job.LiNeBrEaKOklahoma City schools Superintendent Karl Springer: Resolve not to let day-to-day crises distract from the goal of a first-rate education for all children.LiNeBrEaKState Reps.

B-10  	907 words  	Obama on vacationLiNeBrEaKWith President-elect Barack Obama renting three multimillion-dollar beach-front residences in Hawaii solely for his family and friends, and considering all of the money being spent by the media who jetted to cover the story, one must give credit to Obama for providing his own mini-stimulus package to Oahu. Certain questions do arise, however: How will Al Gore feel about the contribution to global warming caused by the exhaust from all of the jets traversing the Pacific? And with all the money spent on such lavish quarters, how Lincoln-ish is this for the man who so much wants to emulate honest but frugal Abe? And with the shots of Obama playing golf, how many Americans will remember the bad press that President Bush received for playing golf once with his father at Kennebunkport?LiNeBrEaKWilliam H. Smith, LiNeBrEaKHighlands RanchLiNeBrEaKSportswriters to blame for Shanahan's firingLiNeBrEaKI'm very disappointed about the firing of Mike Shanahan. It is one of the most boneheaded moves in NFL history, and it was brought about by the constant goading of a bunch ignoramus sportswriters and "johnny-come-lately," whiner fans.LiNeBrEaKThose of us fans who have been through years of mediocre teams under coaches like Lou Sabine, John Ralston, Red Miller, Wade Phillips and Dan Reeves know how hard it is to get a decent coach. How many new coaches are we going to have to go through before we get back to the level that Shanahan set here? Look at the Raiders; they have been through coach after coach in the last few years, without any sign of improvement.LiNeBrEaKI place the blame for this mostly at the feet of sportswriters whose careers are based on controversy. They almost succeeded in getting rid of John Elway by agitating that he "couldn't win the big one." Now they have succeeded in hounding Shanahan out of town.LiNeBrEaKThe irony is that many teams would love to have him and his record. But then, I'm sure that as soon as the Broncos get beat by a Shanahan-coached team, the sportswriters will start hounding owner Pat Bowlen for making a bad decision.LiNeBrEaKLarry Fish, DenverLiNeBrEaKWhat took so long?LiNeBrEaKHe was only averageLiNeBrEaKWe have so wondered why Broncos owner Pat Bowlen kept Mike Shanahan on for all these years. He just was not that good. John Elway carried the day while he was playing for the Broncos. Shanahan was not above average.LiNeBrEaKDaniel Lukensow, LovelandLiNeBrEaKNuggets should takeLiNeBrEaKa cue from BroncosLiNeBrEaKMike Shanahan is a good person; and, at one time, he was effective. Nuggets coach George Karl is a good person; and, at one time, he was effective. Unfortunately, Karl's record of effectiveness has not been with the Nuggets. This is a team loaded with talent, which absolutely has the ability to go well into the playoffs; however, this won't happen under Karl's direction. Why wait until another early exit from the playoffs? Of course, we will; but please do remember in April what the Broncos ownership had the guts to do in December.LiNeBrEaKBarry Siff, BoulderLiNeBrEaKYou'd think this was as big as Pearl HarborLiNeBrEaKAlthough I wasn't around at the time to read it, I'd imagine that The Post's headline declaring the bombing of Pearl Harbor was comparable in print size to that of Wednesday's "Sacked."LiNeBrEaKI realize that I'm being a bit sarcastic. But I am aware of the importance to Coloradans of watching beefy men running around, falling down, and ripping anterior cruciate ligaments in the pursuit of a ball of pigskin. I even like watching a game occasionally, especially when the Broncos do something besides sit on the sidelines in great seats, witnessing the offensiveness of their offense and defense.LiNeBrEaKThe droning on of a multi-millennia war between Semites in what is now Israel, the last gasps of what has become the most pathetic, damaging presidency since Hoover's, and the continued destruction of an economy roped and steered by said presidency and its minions are events probably not warranting the coverage afforded to football. After all, war is ubiquitous, we've known for some time that Bush is a pitiless nincompoop, and we've gotten used to being used by Republicans for their own nefarious ends, especially when money is concerned.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps some balance is necessary when considering the print size of a headline. Then again, how would we figure out the magnitude of an event?LiNeBrEaKJan Sershen, Ca&ntilde;on CityLiNeBrEaKBoomers could be the Greenest GenerationLiNeBrEaKThree decades passed before I joined the green movement, but I did it. Yet I still have bugs to work out. Recently I placed my canvas grocery bag next to the plastic bags at the self-serve checkout, and a computer voice said, "Unexpected item in the bagging area." And then, more loudly, "Unexpected item in the bagging area!" OK, OK. You might wonder what finally moved me to turn green. As member of the baby boomers, I nodded in agreement when Tom Brokaw called our parents the Greatest Generation. They survived the Great Depression and won World War II. How in the world could we ever match that? But it suddenly struck me that if we could save the human race before we reach the tipping point - the point of no return that could come as early as the next decade - we could challenge our parents' generation.LiNeBrEaKTaking canvas bags to the grocery. Driving hybrids. Recycling. Lower the heat in the winter. It's an inconvenience, but it's not extremely hard. With baby boomer Al Gore as our leader, the Greatest Generation may have met its match.LiNeBrEaKSusan Finger, Falcon	LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); US PRESIDENTS (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (56%)  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); AL GORE (57%); GEORGE W BUSH (56%)  	DENVER, CO, USA (71%) HAWAII, USA (94%); COLORADO, USA (71%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 2, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Denver Post All Rights Reserved  				Letter  																		
Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	January 1, 2009 Thursday   ALL S EDITION	We've seen it all;  Wild December wraps up year of weather extremes 	FRONT PAGE; Pg. A1  	503 words  	Yes, December was the perfect month -- to be somewhere else. Snowstorms, rain, a record high temperature, ice, floods, fog, clouds, clouds and clouds. Here is a rundown of why we felt so run down, much of it based on information from WOOD-TV meteorologist Bill Steffen, who likes to keep track of such things but makes no apologies. (Note to Bill: a little sunshine would be nice.) LiNeBrEaKCloudsLiNeBrEaKShadows? Who needs shadows? December likely was the second-cloudiest month in Grand Rapids' recorded history, with slightly more than 5 percent of possible sunshine. In fact, the sun shone longer on July 5 than it did the entire month. The cloudiest ever, with 5. 1 percent sunshine, was November 1992.LiNeBrEaKSnowLiNeBrEaKNearly 54 inches buried Grand Rapids in December, triple the 18-inch average, ranking it as the second-snowiest month ever. The whitest was December 2000, with 59. 2 inches. That's nothing compared to Ludington, where more than 80 inches fell last month. Marquette set a record with 23 straight days of measurable snow.LiNeBrEaKFloodsLiNeBrEaKDam operators opened the flood gates to help ease rare December flooding caused by heavy rain and snowmelt that covered some roads and filled some basements. The Grand River rose 3 feet on Christmas Eve.LiNeBrEaKOther 2008 highlights: Rain ...LiNeBrEaK2008 goes down as the Year of the Umbrella, as the Grand Rapids area recorded its wettest year -- 48. 77 inches of liquid, including rain, melted snow, freezing rain, sleet and whatever else could possibly drop on us. The previous record was 47. 54 inches in 1986, the year of one of West Michigan's worst floods.LiNeBrEaKRain ...LiNeBrEaKAs much as a foot of rain fell in six hours in mid-June -- the biggest drenching ever recorded in Michigan -- as one storm after another crashed into the northern Michigan counties of Mason, Manistee, Wexford and Lake, swamping rivers, washing out roads and leading to a state of emergency.LiNeBrEaKGo awayLiNeBrEaKMichigan got leftovers from three tropical storms, including Gustav and Ike, in September. Usually, tropical storm remnants sweep over the state once every five years. This contributed to another oddity: 60 percent of last summer's rain fell on four days: July 2, Sept. 4, Sept. 13 and Sept. 14.LiNeBrEaKSnow globeLiNeBrEaKWhen it wasn't raining, it was snowing, or so it seemed. The National Weather Service in Grand Rapids measured a record 143 inches of snow for the calendar year, far surpassing the previous high of 118. 3 in 2000. It started in February, with a record 41. 6 inches.LiNeBrEaK4. 68 trillion gallonsLiNeBrEaKAll that water must go somewhere, so it filled the Great Lakes, which needed it, raising levels by a foot last year. Because one inch of rise equals 390 billion gallons, that totals 4. 68 trillion gallons, give or take a few million.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming?LiNeBrEaKThat's not the reason, said Steffen, who predicted this winter's mess based on last winter's weak La Nina pattern -- cold ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific -- and a neutral pattern this summer. "It's a recurrent theme," he says. "When we have that pattern, we have above-average precipitation in the winter."

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	January 1, 2009 Thursday 	A wine fan's New Year's resolutions  	FOOD NEWS  	507 words  	Jan. 1--Despite what you may have heard, wine lovers are not perfect. We need New Year's resolutions too.LiNeBrEaKHere are mine:LiNeBrEaKI will lose 30 pounds (OK, that's out of the way).LiNeBrEaKI will taste every wine I come across that I've never heard of before. This is a rewarding resolution. In 2008, I learned about grillo, a light, crisp, wine from Sicily from the grape of the same name that tastes a little like green tea. A couple of years ago I tasted a cabernet sauvignon made in Cuba. Well, one out of two isn't bad. LiNeBrEaKI will try wines from every new wine area I learn about. Ever have a syrah from British Columbia? It's by Mission Hill, and it tastes of black plums, tobacco, black pepper and red meat. Yes, all at once.LiNeBrEaKSpeaking of that, I will adopt the philosophy of illegitimati non carborundum (look it up; they won't let me say it here in English) when people get on my case about enthusiastic wine descriptions. It's my hobby. As Billy Joel would say, I have been a fool for lesser things. If I say a wine smells like iodine or red meat, it does. To me, anyway.LiNeBrEaKI will continue my quest to try a wine from all 50 states. One of the best wines I've tasted was a sweet dessert wine made of pumpkins in Illinois. They chunked up the pumpkins in a tree shredder and somehow got them to ferment. Now I hear they make wine in Alaska.LiNeBrEaKI will stop making fun of blush zinfandel, even though it has every reason to blush.LiNeBrEaKIn hard economic times, I will become relentless in pursuit of really nice wines under $10. Last year's winner was the 2007 Bodega Norton Malbec from Mendoza, Argentina: chocolate-cherry aromas and flavors; soft, ripe and mellow; $9.LiNeBrEaKI will try wines in boxes. Lots of them. I will do it with an open mind. I will report back the results honestly.LiNeBrEaKI will take with a grain of salt those medical studies that say wine prevents heart attack, stroke, glaucoma, diabetes, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's. I will take comfort knowing those researchers are raising some of the healthiest mice on the planet.LiNeBrEaKI will taste an English wine, if I can find one (and work up my courage). The British press says that, due to global warming, there are more than 200 wineries today in the Sceptered Isle. And if they're as good as English food, well . . .LiNeBrEaKOh, don't write in. There's nothing I love more than steak and kidney pie (wait a minute . . . kidney?!)LiNeBrEaKEven though Chateau Mouton Rothschild's price has plummeted by half to less than $600 a bottle, I will not urge a federal bailout of the wine industry.LiNeBrEaKI will try not to lose my taste for expensive wines. I will try to cultivate a richer class of friends. (If they have a boat, so much the better.)

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	January 1, 2009 Thursday   Sunrise Edition	The notion that nature is sacred  	Living - How We Live  	782 words  	SUMMARY: A Lewis and Clark professor polls people to seeLiNeBrEaKif attitudes weigh in on whether EarthLiNeBrEaKis heading for ruin or redemptionLiNeBrEaKA Lewis and Clark professor polls people on whether nature is sacred Do attitudes weigh in on whether Earth is heading for ruin or redemption? The notionLiNeBrEaKthat nature LiNeBrEaKis sacred Cult classic'sLiNeBrEaKvalues shapedLiNeBrEaKpoll's contentLiNeBrEaKNANCY HAUGHTLiNeBrEaKIn Oregon, the notion that nature is sacred scarcely raises an eyebrow. It's a given for people of faith and common ground for others who say they aren't religious but care deeply about the natural world. A Lewis and Clark College professor wonders how widespread these attitudes are across the United States and how they shape dreams --and nightmares --about the future.LiNeBrEaKJim Proctor, head of environmental studies at Lewis and Clark, and a team of student researchers recently surveyed almost 140 Oregonians and interviewed representatives from 18 different communities on the subject. Alpha Farm, a communal enterprise about 55 miles northwest of Eugene, was among the intentional groups they compared to communities such as Cannon Beach. The team interviewed people from urban, suburban and rural places as varied as Ashland and Northeast Portland's Woodlawn neighborhood, Breitenbush and the Pearl.LiNeBrEaKNow Proctor hopes that online advertising will help spur nationwide participation in his 26-question survey. Specifically, his hope is that 1,000 more people will share their views on religion, nature and whether they see the future as a utopian dream of humans living in harmony with nature or as a dystopian nightmare of total destruction wrought by climate change.LiNeBrEaKUtopias, or perfect societies, and their opposites, dystopias, have long been part of college studies, especially in literature, philosophy and sociology classes. But Proctor sees utopias and dystopias as indicators of people's greatest hopes and fears, and their attitudes toward the environment. Part of Proctor's inspiration is "Ecotopia," a novel published in the 1970s by Ernest Callenbach. A recent headline in The New York Times described the cult classic as "The Novel that Predicted Portland."LiNeBrEaK"Ecotopia" describes a breakaway state in the Pacific Northwest where the economy is sustainable, eating is local and recycling and public transportation are the norm. Proctor and his team --Evan Berry, Meagan Nuss and Amber Shasky --identified several values present in the novel about whether and why nature is sacred, where humans find spiritual meaning and how they express it. The team developed a survey, christened it "Ecotopia Revisited" and posted it online (http://ecotopia.survey.sgizmo.com).LiNeBrEaKProctor, who has studied religion and nature before, knows the survey results won't reflect a representative sampling of the population. They will be skewed, for example, toward computer users who visit sites such as Beliefnet, where the survey will be advertised. It's harder in these days of cell phones to get a statistically representative sample, he says, but that might not be so critical in this study. Proctor wants people to think about utopias, dystopias and what they say about the inner and outer worlds we live in, "the worlds we inhabit and the worlds we imagine," as he puts it.LiNeBrEaKSo far, he and his team have noticed that interest in ecotopian ideals is strong within intentional communities and outside of them and across political and theological boundaries of left and right, liberal and conservative. And the responses pose interesting questions themselves.LiNeBrEaK"In the three-plus decades since publication of 'Ecotopia,' the magnitude of --and arguably our awareness of --global political, ecological and social crisis has grown," Proctor says. "Has this sent us more and more toward envisioning better worlds at smaller and smaller scales, effectively giving up on global possibilities?"LiNeBrEaKThe survey takes only a few minutes to finish, and an e-mail afterward shows each respondent how he or she compares with other participants to date.LiNeBrEaKThe survey results are still tentative, and not all of what they suggest so far is new to Proctor. A majority of respondents believe that nature is inherently sacred, and about a third say people must respect the natural world because God made it.LiNeBrEaKWhen it comes to dystopias and utopias, a majority say they fear their worst nightmares about the state of this world may come true and that the ideal society is built on Earth-friendly technologies.LiNeBrEaK"Most utopian and dystopian discourse points outward, to the worlds it describes," Proctor says. "The key question we ask in Ecotopia Revisited is, what do our contemporary utopias and dystopias tell us about ourselves?"LiNeBrEaKNancy Haught: 503-294-7625; nancyhaught@news.oregonian.com	COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (90%); RELIGION (89%); POLLS and SURVEYS (89%); NOVELS and SHORT STORIES (86%); HUMANITIES and SOCIAL SCIENCE (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (78%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (77%); SOCIOLOGY (75%); CLIMATE CHANGE (73%); ONLINE MARKETING and ADVERTISING (70%); ONLINE ADVERTISING (65%); MARKETING and ADVERTISING (52%); SEPARATISM and SECESSION (50%)  		PORTLAND, OR, USA (90%) OREGON, USA (94%); WEST USA (79%); NORTHWEST USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 2, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  	NANCY HAUGHT, The Oregonian  																					
Palm Beach Post (Florida) 	January 1, 2009 Thursday   FINAL EDITION	ANNIVERSARY OF CASTRO'S RISE COMES AT TIME OF CHANGE  	A SECTION; Pg. 12A  	1051 words  	Fidel Castro's revolution was already three decades old when Alberto Diaz was born, and today's 50th anniversary of the event leaves the Havana teenager less than excited.LiNeBrEaK"Oh, it's important in Cuba," said the 15-year-old, who spent a recent afternoon goofing off on a park bench with several pals. "But to me, ah," he said, giving a flick of the wrist known around the globe as a teen put-down.LiNeBrEaKCastro may be hailed as a hero by Latin American leftists for his long-running defiance of America, but the ailing communist lion may be facing his toughest foe on the streets of his own tightly controlled island. LiNeBrEaKCuba's celebration today of the revolution's half-century mark comes at a time of transition. The young, bearded rebels Castro led to victory in 1959 are now old men, and Cuba's youth today -- about 60 percent of the population is younger than 35 -- know little about those long-ago events, other than what they've learned in school.LiNeBrEaKMany of them remain as loyal to Castro as their parents, but, like young people everywhere, others yearn for change and opportunity.LiNeBrEaK"We don't talk about politics because we don't care about politics," said Graciela Leon, 16, one of Diaz's friends, as she pulled the white earbud of a tiny iPod music player from her ear to address a visitor.LiNeBrEaKFidel Castro, now 82, has disappeared from public view, sidelined by an intestinal illness that reportedly nearly killed him in 2006. He gave up the reins of power to his brother, Raul, 77, nearly a year ago.LiNeBrEaKThe senior Castro has assumed the role of elder statesman, penning frequent essays in the state-controlled media on topics from global warming to American politics.LiNeBrEaKHis brother has enacted a few reforms and talked of more, but seems unlikely to unleash major changes in Cuba.LiNeBrEaKThere is widespread speculation, even hope, among many Cubans, that U.S. President-elect Obama will improve relations, opening a dialogue that Raul Castro has said he would welcome.LiNeBrEaKBut with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan on his plate, along with the worldwide economic crisis, Obama may assign the Cuba question a low priority.LiNeBrEaKSo as the ubiquitous Cuban propaganda machine marks the revolution's 50th anniversary, average Cubans plod along, waiting, as always, to see what will happen.LiNeBrEaK"I'm very hopeful that relations between our countries will improve," said Diego Garcia, 37, who works in a store selling items to tourists. "But we've learned that it's best to be patient, that these things are out of our hands."LiNeBrEaKCastro's revolution was remarkable in many ways. After a failed attack on a military barracks in the early 1950s, he spent time in a Cuban prison before gaining release and going into exile in Mexico.LiNeBrEaKHe returned with a tiny band of guerrillas a few years later, mounting an insurgent campaign that, against heavy odds, bested the army of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. Batista enjoyed strong backing from the U.S. government and American business interests, who exercised great influence in Cuba at the time.LiNeBrEaKAfter his triumphant entry into Havana in early January 1959, Castro toyed with American diplomats, but moved steadily leftward, eventually declaring himself a communist and embracing the Soviet Union, America's Cold War nemesis, as his patron.LiNeBrEaKOver the decades he survived a CIA-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs by Cuban exiles, a nuclear showdown with America over the installation of Russian missiles in Cuba and what he claimed were hundreds of U.S. assassination attempts.LiNeBrEaKHis government became an iron-clad dictatorship with a centrally planned economy, one that performed miserably and survived largely on billions of dollars in Soviet subsidies.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps Castro's most notable accomplishment was surviving the Soviet Union's dissolution in the early 1990s, an event that plunged Cuba into crisis, with widespread food shortages.LiNeBrEaKBut Castro's survival was also due largely to his pervasive internal security forces, which stifled all opposition, prompting hundreds of thousands of Cubans to flee to the United States.LiNeBrEaK"The revolution's greatest achievement has been to keep Fidel and his successors in power for 50 years, withstanding all the pressure applied by the U.S.," said Dan Erikson of Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank, and author of the book, The Cuba Wars.LiNeBrEaKStill, there is genuine affection and loyalty among many Cubans for Castro.LiNeBrEaK"For all their country's problems, the Cuban people have a great pride in his revolution," Erikson said.LiNeBrEaKThe regime's popularity is strongest among those of Castro's generation, who lived through poverty and inequality under Batista and joined the revolt with great hopes.LiNeBrEaK"The revolution is a golden cup for every Cuban," said Felix Hernandez, 62, who watched Castro's triumph as a boy. "We'll give our lives, every one of us, for it."LiNeBrEaKSuch fervor was rampant at a recent congress of the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, neighborhood watch groups that keep tabs on every Cuban and promote communist principles.LiNeBrEaKHundreds of delegates at Havana's convention center clapped and cheered speeches by their leaders, who addressed them beneath a giant colorful banner calling for "More Unity, More Combativeness, Defending Socialism."LiNeBrEaKSuch propaganda salvos are ubiquitous in Cuba, where sun-bleached billboards proclaim "Socialism or Death," and "Onward to Victory."LiNeBrEaKPatriotic Cubans cite universal education and literacy, free health care and increased life expectancy among the revolution's greatest accomplishments.LiNeBrEaKOpponents say such improvements have come at the price of free speech and limited opportunity. Most Cubans earn the equivalent of about $20 a month, many struggle to feed their families and few have hopes of traveling freely abroad.LiNeBrEaKStill, with Fidel Castro in the twilight of his career, many Cubans vow his legacy, and his revolution, will survive for decades to come.LiNeBrEaK"Whatever you need, Fidel will provide," chanted the delegates at the congress. "We hear it, we feel it, Fidel is present," they also chanted.LiNeBrEaKBleisy Varela, 30, a delegate who lives on the outskirts of Havana, said Cuba's youth are just as committed to the revolution as their elders.LiNeBrEaK"I wasn't born when it happened, but it's important to me," she said. "The revolution is a battle, and it's important for us younger Cubans to keep it alive."LiNeBrEaK~mwilliams@coxnews.com	ANNIVERSARIES (91%); IRAQ WAR (68%); PORTABLE MEDIA PLAYERS (64%); GLOBAL WARMING (62%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (50%); SENIOR CITIZENS (73%); US PRESIDENTS (60%)  	FIDEL CASTRO (96%); BARACK OBAMA (81%); RAUL CASTRO (74%)  	CUBA (97%); UNITED STATES (93%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); IRAQ (79%); AFGHANISTAN (71%)  	February 3, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 The Palm Beach Newspapers, Inc.

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Pennsylvania)  	January 1, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: The New Year's wrap  	COMMENTARY  	347 words  	Jan. 1--And they get raises!: Members of the world's most famous do-nothing body -- the United States Congress -- are enjoying a raise effective today. For porking billions of your dollars, for engaging in this scandal or that and for generally doing things that result in the firing of most people in the private sector, each member of Congress is getting an automatic pay raise of $4,700. Their new salary -- $174,000 annually. They certainly didn't earn it. It's time to repeal these automatic raises for so many exercises in automatic failure. LiNeBrEaKObama "bristles"? Thank God for the new year. That means some in the media can stop fabricating stories. To wit, one headline noted "Obama bristles as the bubble closes in." The Politico.com story referenced, among others, an incident in which a Washington Post reporter took notes on Mr. Obama's lunch order while on his Hawaiian vacation. "You don't really need to write all that down," Obama said. But the video of the incident hardly suggests Obama "bristled." In fact, it was a good-natured comment made with a broad smile. We're no big fans of Obama. But we're even smaller fans of manufactured news.LiNeBrEaKGlobal exposure: World temperatures are dropping, more scientists are speaking out against the "consensus" of global warming, and the recession should put the kibosh on "quixotic schemes for 'combating climate change,'" offers London Daily Mail columnist Christopher Booker. But the public still must be on guard against the worldwide schemers who will stop at nothing to still employ "global warming" as their agent of social re-engineering.

San Antonio Express-News 	January 1, 2009 Thursday   STATEandMETRO Edition	Limits on water use may come even earlier  	A SECTION; Pg. 1A  	808 words  	San Antonio finished 2008 with the driest 16-month September-through-December in recorded history, with less than an inch of rain in the past four months and climate scientists saying the dry conditions could last into next fall.LiNeBrEaK"It's really been an extraordinarily dry period," said Karen Guz, conservation director for the San Antonio Water System, which will start a process Tuesday to make drought restrictions kick in sooner. LiNeBrEaK"We can't afford to presume this drought will be brief," said Guz, who will ask the SAWS board to request that the City Council change the ordinance to make drought restrictions start when the Edwards Aquifer falls to 660 feet above sea level instead of the current trigger of 650 feet.LiNeBrEaK"It will mean restrictions for our customers a couple of months earlier, but it saves a lot of water, and that's water that we could need if this drought continues," Guz said.LiNeBrEaKThe area drought already is classified as exceptional, the worst category. That means residents can expect widespread crop and pasture losses and shortages of water in reservoirs, streams and wells.LiNeBrEaKThe 16. 4 inches of rain that has fallen since Sept. 1, 2007, is more than an inch less than the next-driest such period, which occurred at the end of the seven-year drought of the 1950s.LiNeBrEaKWith only 13. 76 inches of rain, 2008 ended as the third-driest year since rainfall record-keeping began in 1871. And the 0. 98 inches recorded since Sept. 1 this year marked only the third time that less than an inch of rain has fallen during any four-month period, according to National Weather Service data.LiNeBrEaKAlthough most rivers are running at less than 25 percent of normal and most area lakes are at 55 percent to 80 percent of capacity, the Edwards Aquifer so far hasn't dropped to any of the trigger points for mandatory cutbacks on pumpers.LiNeBrEaKBut officials say that could change as farmers start irrigating their fields later this month.LiNeBrEaKThe aquifer's level Wednesday at the index well in San Antonio was at 669. 5 feet above sea level. That's 0. 4 feet above the historical December level and 9. 5 feet above the trigger for mandatory 20 percent cutbacks for pumpers.LiNeBrEaKSan Marcos Springs is more of a concern. Its average flow on Tuesday was 98 cubic feet per second, just 2 cfs above the trigger for the 20 percent Stage I cutbacks by the Edwards Aquifer Authority. The 98 cfs is 76 cfs below the norm for December.LiNeBrEaKAnd the outlook for relief is bleak. The latest weekly forecast by scientists for the weather phenomenon known as La Ni&ntilde;a indicates it's strengthening and could last into next fall.LiNeBrEaKLa Ni&ntilde;a, an upwelling of cold water in the Pacific Ocean, changes wind and moisture circulation patterns, generally bringing drier conditions to Central Texas.LiNeBrEaKLa Ni&ntilde;a started this dry spell in 2007 and officially ended in June, when sea surface temperatures in the Pacific rose above the official trigger for such conditions. But scientists say a global circulation pattern typical of La Ni&ntilde;a has continued and now strengthened with sea surface temperatures again dropping below the trigger.LiNeBrEaKRoland Ruiz, spokesman for the Edwards authority, said farmers west of San Antonio soon would begin irrigating fields to get deep moisture for crops that will start to go in next month.LiNeBrEaK"Historically, when we see irrigation start, we see an impact on the aquifer," he said. "Based on what we've seen, it could be early in January that we see the need to declare Stage I."LiNeBrEaKMore typically, usage restrictions are triggered in the heat of the summer when demand is high, Ruiz said.LiNeBrEaKJim Dutton, co-owner of a Texas-based foundation repair company and national treasurer of the Foundation Repair Association, said this drought is as bad as previous ones for foundations, but calls aren't coming in like usual.LiNeBrEaKHe blames that on the economic downturn and people's concerns about spending money.LiNeBrEaKDutton said the concern is houses built on clay soils, which shrink when they dry and expand when they get wet. The trick to avoiding problems, he said, is to maintain even moisture levels in the soil around a foundation. That can be done by laying a soaker hose 12 inches to 18 inches from the foundation and running it for 15 minutes twice a day, he said.LiNeBrEaKAs far as the short-term forecast, there's a slight chance for rain through noon today, but a better chance as a cold front moves in Sunday night and Monday, said Bob Fogarty, meteorologist with the National Weather Service's forecast office in New Braunfels.LiNeBrEaK"It could be a quarter of an inch," he said.LiNeBrEaKA RECORD DROUGHTLiNeBrEaKThe 12 driest 16-month September-through-December periods in San Antonio (in inches):LiNeBrEaKSource: National Weather Service data	DROUGHT (92%); WEATHER (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); AQUIFERS and WATERSHEDS (89%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (89%); HISTORY (78%); WATER SUPPLY UTILITIES (76%); ORDINANCES (75%); IRRIGATION (74%); RIVERS (74%); LAKES (74%); WATER QUALITY (73%); CITY GOVERNMENT (70%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (70%); CAPACITY UTILIZATION (63%); CITIES (55%)  		SAN ANTONIO, TX, USA (92%) TEXAS, USA (92%); PACIFIC OCEAN (76%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 3, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2009 San Antonio Express-News All Rights Reserved  	Jerry Needham  		TEXAS DROUGHT EXPECTED TO PERSIST (MAP).

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 1, 2009 Thursday 	Salt Lake sunshine  	OPINION; Editorials  	373 words  	Salt Lake County's solar power initiative is a ray of sunshine in a dark, gloomy and rapidly warming world. There's nothing unique about the technology. But the funding mechanism merits more than a mention. LiNeBrEaKIf all goes according to plan, the roofs of 50 county-owned buildings will soon be covered with arrays of solar panels producing clean, renewable electricity, and they won't cost taxpayers a dime.LiNeBrEaKPrivate firms will install the panels, utilizing state and federal tax credits to reduce the cost. The electricity will be sold to the county at a fixed rate comparable to current costs, which will allow the provider to earn a profit without increasing the county's electric bill. Taxpayers will break even, the private sector will get a boost, and the environment will benefit from a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKAccording to a study commissioned by Peter Corroon, the county's clean, green and innovative mayor, county rooftops can hold solar panels sufficient to produce 9. 6 megawatts of electricity, enough to power nearly 5,000 homes when the sun shines. And that means a lot less high-carbon coal being fed into power plants, and a lot less carbon dioxide spewing from smoke stacks, contributing to global warming that imperils the planet.LiNeBrEaKThe sunshine mine has been on Corroon's agenda for more than a year. The original plan had the county installing the solar arrays. But the price tag, an estimated $72 million for equipment and installation, put the project out of reach in these lean times.LiNeBrEaKInstead of abandoning the effort, though, county officials wisely privatized the plan, creating a model that, if successful, could spur similar public/private solar power partnerships in Utah, and perhaps nationwide.LiNeBrEaKIt's not the county's first dance with solar power. In a pair of successful pilot projects, solar panels were placed on the Clark Planetarium and the Salt Palace parking garage and connected to Rocky Mountain Power's grid. Now the county will try to increase the scale of the initiative by putting 20 rooftops on the market in 2009.LiNeBrEaKFirst, Corroon will ask the state Legislature to improve the project's chances by sweetening the tax incentives for large-scale solar power projects in the state. Lawmakers should.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 1, 2009 Thursday 	Will this be the year for a peripheral canal?  	NEWS  	815 words  	Even while a court order cuts water deliveries by one-third as it aims to protect the small, silvery and endangered Delta smelt, the maze of waterways formed at the meeting of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers remain California's leading relay point for water.LiNeBrEaKFrom pumps at the south end of the Delta, the lifeblood of this state flows to farms and cities like Walnut Creek, Oakland and San Jose, Bakersfield, Los Angeles and San Diego. LiNeBrEaKEveryone knows the Delta is in trouble. Possibly undependable levees threaten housing developments built below the water level of nearby rivers. Salt water intrusion diminishes water quality. And if Sierra Nevada snowpacks continue to lessen gradually because of global warming, the Delta will receive less and less water.LiNeBrEaKAdd it up, and it's plain something needs to be done. The more analysis the Delta gets, the more obvious it becomes that a solution offered as early as 1982 remains the best answer today.LiNeBrEaKThat is a peripheral canal. This would be a concrete ditch carrying fresh water from the Sacramento and American rivers around the Delta's eastern edge to the northern end of the state Water Project and the federal Central Valley Project, whose vast aqueducts and reservoirs would store it and later bring it to users sorely in need. A canal could capture flood waters that now run out to sea without accomplishing anything much.LiNeBrEaKNot all the canal's water would go to cities and farms, either. The canal could have gates and pumps pouring water into the Delta whenever needed to improve water quality and assure healthy wildlife and fish habitats.LiNeBrEaKThis was a sound idea in 1982, but was killed by hysteria in Northern California that produced the most successful referendum ever (referenda in this state differ from initiatives because they seek to reverse laws passed by the Legislature rather than creating new ones).LiNeBrEaKAfter legislators passed a plan to build a peripheral canal, environmental groups and others in Northern California convinced virtually all voters in the vast region that the canal amounted to water theft by Southern California cities from northern rivers. The campaign against the canal argued that it would mean inevitable damming of wild rivers like the Smith and the Eel.LiNeBrEaKDespite the fact such dams were prohibited by the canal law, those claims carried the day. While the anti-canal referendum lost by a 65-35 percent margin in Southern California, it won majorities of 90 percent and more in every Northern California county, the closest thing to a Soviet-style plebiscite this state has ever seen.LiNeBrEaKNow, however, some of the very people who led the charge against the peripheral canal are backing it.LiNeBrEaK"I was mistaken," Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said late last year. Hers was one of the first signatures on the petitions qualifying the referendum that killed the canal.LiNeBrEaKAnd Phil Isenberg, ex-mayor of Sacramento and now a lobbyist there, has just finished heading a task force appointed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to develop solutions for the Delta and the state's water supply.LiNeBrEaKThe key idea in his report: something very like the old peripheral canal proposal. Other recommendations include new dams and reservoirs, increasing the amount of recycled water used in the state and cutting statewide water use by 20 percent over the next 11 years.LiNeBrEaKWhile they applaud other parts of the plan, environmental groups so far have not joined Isenberg and Feinstein in reversing their stance on the canal. Outfits like the Natural Resources Defense Council remain convinced conservation and recycling alone can solve problems like the drought that now threatens to cause water rationing in many areas, a drought not ended despite heavy early winter rains.LiNeBrEaKThe timing of the new water report couldn't have been better. It came during the height of the presidential campaign, with the Legislature out of session and almost no one paying attention. So all its components, including the updated canal concept, have had time to percolate and now should be acted on in a non-election year, when politicians are not quite as likely to fear swift constituent retribution as they might be in 2010.LiNeBrEaKThe bottom line: Californians must do something to solve the Delta's problems and restore the significant portion of their water supply now flowing uselessly into the ocean because of the smelt-related court ruling and a subsequent order from the federal Fish and Wildlife Service. No one has ever shown conservation and recycling alone can do enough.LiNeBrEaKWhich means any comprehensive plan will have to include a way to bring water around the Delta. The list of prices to pay for inaction would surely include a lot of dry throats and brown lawns, severe food price increases and major problems for any attempts at building housing and industries.LiNeBrEaKTom Elias is a syndicated columnist who writes on state affairs.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	January 1, 2009 Thursday   Final Edition	Airline uses jatropha oil as biofuel  	Business; Pg. E3  	530 words  	 CUTLINES WELLINGTON, New Zealand Looking to reduce its carbon footprint and cut its fuel bill, Air New Zealand has tested a passenger jet that was powered partially with oil from a plum-sized fruit known as jatropha. The airline is the latest carrier to experiment with alternative fuels, partly due to the threat of rising oil prices but also to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from aviation, which are projected to rise by 90 percent by 2020. Air New Zealand said Tuesday's two-hour flight from Auckland International Airport was the first to use what are known as second-generation biofuels to power an airplane. Second-generation biofuels typically use a wider range of plants and release fewer emissions than traditional biofuels such as ethanol.  LiNeBrEaKOne engine of the Boeing 747-400 airplane was powered by a 50-50 blend of oil from jatropha plants and standard A1 jet fuel. "Today, we stand at the earliest stages of sustainable fuel development and an important moment in aviation history," said Rob Fyfe, Air New Zealand CEO, shortly after the flight. Along with investing in new technology to replace outdated fleets and new designs that reduce weight and air resistance, the International Air Transport Association says airlines are experimenting with a range of plant materials in an effort to find the jet fuel of the future. The association, which represents 230 airlines, said it wants 10 percent of aviation fuel to come from biofuels by 2017 as part of a broad climate change plan. Air travel now generates only 2 percent of global carbon emissions that are believed to contribute to global warming, but the industry's high growth rate has raised concern about future emissions. "There are very promising biojet fuels, and jatropha is one of them," said association spokesman Anthony Concil, adding that the industry is also looking at switch grass, algae and salt-tolerant plants called halophytes. Jatropha is a bush with round, plum-like fruit that has been found in parts of South America, Africa and Asia. Seeds from jatropha are crushed to produce a yellowish oil that is refined and mixed with diesel. Tuesday's flight was a joint venture by Air New Zealand, airplane maker Boeing Co., engine maker Rolls Royce and biofuel specialist UOP Llc, a unit of Honeywell International Inc. Simon Boxer, of environmental group Greenpeace New Zealand, said it was inevitable that airlines would show greater interest in sustainable biofuels as travelers become more aware of the harm that air travel causes the environment. But he said it wasn't clear whether jatropha was really sustainable. He questioned what the environmental impact would be if jatropha grew popular and more land and resources were needed to produce it on a commercial scale. Ken Morton, a Boeing spokesman, said he expects more airlines will embrace biofuels as countries introduce emission taxes and emission trading schemes that will impact the industry. "It makes a lot of commercial sense to invest in these biofuels," said Morton, who was on hand for the New Zealand flight. "Certainly, it is what the public wants."

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	January 1, 2009 Thursday   Final Edition	GOP, Obama have one thing alike: change  	Business; Pg. E4  	545 words  	With historic elections behind us, change is coming at both the state and national levels in 2009. In Oklahoma, change is already apparent in the Legislature. As a result of the elections, Republicans control the Senate for the first time in history and have increased their majority by four seats in the House. Republicans will now appoint committee chairs and members of committees, including conference committees.  LiNeBrEaKLegislatively, such issues as lawsuit reform and workers' compensation reform, long-standing priorities of the business community, will face less-rocky paths in the state Senate, making real change more likely. Priorities such as an elimination of joint and several liability and caps on noneconomic damages, along with overhaul of the Workers' Compensation Court, could gain traction but would still have to get past the veto pen of Gov. Brad Henry. Business perspectives on other issues such as health care and education will also benefit from the new legislative order. Issues such as water development, technology and economic development shouldn't be significantly affected. At the federal level, the Barack Obama campaign built its support on the theme of change and will have the ear of a Democratic Congress that increased its majority. An Obama administration can be expected to push "card check" legislation, which would make it easier for organized labor to infiltrate workplaces by eliminating the secret ballot in union elections. The real danger here is if "card check" passes, labor may next go after Section 14 (b) of the Taft-Hartley Act, which allows states to enact right-to-work laws. Oklahoma became the 22nd right-to-work state in 2001. Extreme environmentalists will also hold great sway and will push for carbon cap and trade legislation or a carbon tax to address the perceived greenhouse gas threat, as well as for repeal of the recently lifted ban on offshore drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. The carbon legislation could cost businesses and consumers billions of dollars and the loss of countless jobs. If there is to be a comprehensive climate change policy, at the least, it should inflict no economic harm. As for drilling offshore, the hard truth is that the nation, for the short term, will continue to depend on fossil fuels for energy while technologies can be developed for alternatives. Then, a combination of fossil fuels and alternative energy sources will allow for a feasible energy policy. On a more positive note, the president-elect is said to support an economic stimulus package that would spend money on infrastructure improvements, which would also create jobs. There are also signs that the new administration could renew the role of government in economic development, particularly in urban and rural areas of distress, and prioritize education to strengthen human capital and jobs creation. One thing is certain: the challenges of the current financial climate demand strong leadership, and the State Chamber of Oklahoma, as a nonpartisan business advocate, encourages leaders of both political parties at state and federal levels to work together to move the economy forward and create positive change.

Where are Al Gore and other politicians that were calling for a carbon tax, last July and August, to prevent this dreaded global warming?

The Washington Times 	January 1, 2009 Thursday 	Bumpy middle road  	COMMENTARY; A14  	878 words  	President-elect Barack Obama's risk-adverse, centrist-leaning Cabinet appointments suggest there may be a lot less "change you can believe in" coming out of his administration.LiNeBrEaKThere are dyed-in-the-wool liberals in this pack, to be sure. Rep. Hilda L. Solis of California, chosen to be labor secretary, has a knee-jerk, pro-union voting record and will toe the line for the AFL-CIO's agenda. The labor federation called her "an inspired choice." Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, who will be in charge of shaping and pushing Mr. Obama's health-care reforms as health and human services secretary, supports a government-run health-insurance system. Indeed, he wants to go further than Mr. Obama toward universal health care.LiNeBrEaKYou can't get more liberal than Carol M. Browner, who will be White House energy czar. She comes out of Ralph Nader's holy war against corporations and capitalism and was joined at the hip to Al Gore's radical global-warming agenda as head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Clinton. LiNeBrEaKBut there were many other appointments to what The Washington Post disappointedly called "a team of moderates" that suggested caution and timidity as Mr. Obama shapes the Cabinet that will run his administration over the next four years.LiNeBrEaKLet's start with his trade representative. In the Democratic presidential primaries, Mr. Obama was breathing fire against the North American Free Trade Agreement, and just about any other trade agreement, saying he would renegotiate NAFTA with Canada and Mexico. His trade rhetoric became increasingly protectionist as he battled Hillary Clinton for labor's support.LiNeBrEaKBut he chose former Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk, who has been a supporter of NAFTA, to be his chief trade representative. It turns out that Austan Goolsbee, the University of Chicago economist who is one of Mr. Obama's top advisers, was telling the truth when he told Canadian envoys earlier this year not to take the freshman senator's anti-trade rhetoric seriously, creating a storm of controversy.LiNeBrEaKOr consider Mr. Obama's choice for education secretary, Arne Duncan, chief executive of the Chicago school system, who is being praised to the hilt by President Bush's Education Secretary Margaret Spellings for his support of Mr. Bush's No Child Left Behind educational program.LiNeBrEaKThen there is his decision to name Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar to be his Interior secretary. Oil-industry leaders were especially happy to see Mr. Obama pick someone who is a supporter of offshore exploration and drilling. Exxon-Mobil couldn't be happier.LiNeBrEaKAs for agriculture secretary, where farm subsidies have gone through the roof, giant agribusiness interests were cheering the selection of former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, who will be in their hip pocket. He is a longtime supporter of the heavily subsidized biotech and corn-based ethanol industries.LiNeBrEaKHis choice for commerce secretary is especially off message, though not one the party's left is cheering. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Obama attacked President Bush's across-the-board tax cuts and his pro-business leanings.LiNeBrEaKBut he chose New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson (largely because he is Hispanic?), who also cut income taxes across the board to make his state more competitive with its neighbors whose tax rates were lower. Not just for the middle class but for all income levels. He's pro-free trade, too. No wonder he is one of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's favorite governors.LiNeBrEaKRepublican Ray LaHood was a surprising choice as transportation secretary, too. Not necessarily because he was a staunch supporter of John McCain but because he has no background in transportation policy. Known as an unerring centrist in Congress, he has a reputation as a deficit hawk.LiNeBrEaKBut Mr. LaHood, who has been a critic of the Bush administration, has built a strong relationship with Mr. Obama in Congress as a major player on the House Appropriations Committee for the Illinois congressional delegation. When it comes time to extract more money out of Congress for Mr. Obama's big-spending infrastructure stimulus agenda, Mr. LaHood's influence with the panel could be critical.LiNeBrEaKThese and other lesser-known nominees not only reveal Mr. Obama's strong tendency toward pragmatism but also his wariness about not being seen as too liberal or too centrist. The danger in all this is that he will end up with a team of ideological rivals that has no unified political philosophy to hold the administration together as it steers its way through a storm of conflicting issues and challenges.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps the most surprising manifestation of this ad-hoc approach to the administration's top players came last week when Vice President-elect Joe Biden, chosen for his foreign-policy acumen, said he has been asked by Mr. Obama to oversee a panel to find ways to build up the middle class.LiNeBrEaKThis is about as far away from foreign policy and national-security issues as you can get, and that may be what Mr. Obama's inner circle wants.LiNeBrEaKThat raises this important thought: If his administration doesn't already know how to build up the middle class just as it is about to assume power, he may be in more trouble than anyone realizes.LiNeBrEaKDonald Lambro, chief political correspondent of The Washington Times, is a nationally syndicated columnist.

The Washington Post 	January 1, 2009 Thursday   Regional Edition	Bush Interior Dept. Is Giving Itself A Pat on the Back;  Environmentalists Take Issue With List of Achievements 	A-SECTION; Pg. A11  	771 words  	As President Bush's tenure comes to a close, independent experts and administration insiders are delivering their assessments of his government's performance over the past eight years. Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne has posted his own verdict on his department's Web site, and the upshot is that he did great.LiNeBrEaKUnder the heading "Bush Administration Accomplishments at the Department of the Interior," the agency lists 26 achievements it has made since 2001. Some of the policies and programs named have received bipartisan accolades, such as the National Park Centennial Initiative, which will add at least $1 billion to the park system's budget over the next decade, along with another $1 billion in federal matching money that must be paired with an equal amount in private donations. LiNeBrEaKBut Interior also lists some of its most controversial policies, including its decision to list the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act while circumscribing the move's broader implications.LiNeBrEaKThe fact sheet states: "After months of careful study and the development of new, cutting edge scientific techniques to properly identify, track and predict the effect of declining sea ice on polar bear populations worldwide, the Department proposed and then listed the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The Department further developed a Polar Bear action plan to help protect the bear."LiNeBrEaKBut Kempthorne has emphasized repeatedly that this decision cannot lead to federal limits on greenhouse gas emissions, even though such emissions are fueling the warming that is shrinking the sea ice on which polar bears depend for survival.LiNeBrEaKIn a news conference with reporters last month, Kempthorne said it is impossible to prove that greenhouse gas emissions from sources such as coal-fired power plants in the continental United States threaten the polar bear's survival.LiNeBrEaK"We do not believe the science is there to make the causal link between activities in the Lower 48 to the take of a polar bear," he said.LiNeBrEaKDavid Moulton, who directs climate policy and conservation funding for the Wilderness Society, an advocacy group, wrote in an e-mail that Kempthorne should not praise the department for its actions when it has not taken sufficient measures.LiNeBrEaK"The bear is threatened because its habitat is melting as a result of global warming. The secretary apparently has studied why he CAN'T help fight global warming on behalf of the polar bear, but he hasn't any suggestions about how he CAN," Moulton wrote, using capital letters for emphasis. "His 'Polar Bear action plan to help protect the bear' is a furry flight of fancy. He threw the bear a lifeline that was too short, and is now patting himself on the back for trying."LiNeBrEaKThe Interior Department did not respond to a request for comment on the list.LiNeBrEaKOne of the accomplishments the list cites -- the creation of 15 national wildlife refuges -- did not sit well with Evan Hirsche, president of the National Wildlife Refuge Association. Hirsche noted that the refuge system has had to cut 300 jobs because of budget constraints, since the $434 million that refuges receive each year from the federal government falls at least $330 million short of what they need to operate.LiNeBrEaK"This has been eight years of lost opportunity in terms of acquiring sensitive habitat and creating new national wildlife refuges. The need has never been greater, yet land acquisition coffers have been starved and willing sellers turned away because of bureaucratic red tape," Hirsche said. "New refuges conserve wildlife, bolster property values and result in economic gains for communities. It's hard to understand why this administration has neglected such a winning proposition."LiNeBrEaKA few other achievements on Interior's list are likely to cheer environmentalists, such as the fact that since 2001 the department has issued more than 180 wind leases and 380 geothermal leases, which translates into more than 1,600 megawatts of renewable electricity capacity on public lands.LiNeBrEaKBut this is likely to be outweighed by other items, such as the agency's authorization of six research, development and demonstration oil-shale projects. Several leading environmental groups -- along with President-elect Barack Obama's interior secretary designee, Ken Salazar, and the majority of Colorado's congressional delegation -- have decried the administration's push for commercial oil-shale development on the grounds that it could deplete scarce water resources and harm nearby habitat.LiNeBrEaKOf course, Salazar may have his own shot at publishing an Interior Department accomplishments list several years from now.

Anchorage Daily News (Alaska)  	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	'The Last Polar Bear...': Photographer's 10-year obsession results in wonderful and timely book  	LIFESTYLE  	1345 words  	ANCHORAGE, Alaska_As gorgeous and haunting as Steven Kazlowski's images are, there's nothing pretty about the work needed to get them.LiNeBrEaKAny competent wildlife photographer knows all about waiting. Far fewer have waited in bitter subzero cold for weeks on end, hoping for the wind and the sun and other conditions to be right for a glimpse at the planet's largest land predator.LiNeBrEaKThat's why Kazlowski's "The Last Polar Bear: Facing the Truth of a Warming World" (Braided River, 208 pages, $39. 95), published earlier this year, is such a marvel of wildlife photography and, at the same time, much more than gorgeous eye candy.LiNeBrEaKKazlowski's polar bear obsession has endured for more than a decade, and while the book includes several writers' essays, Kazlowski's 235 images are the soul of a book that offers readers intimacy with a creature few will ever see in nature. LiNeBrEaK"For quite a while, it was an education just being up there _ to swallow that whole thing, that huge place that's the Arctic," said Kazlowski, who lives in Seattle. "It's been changing 40-50 years, and it's not completely visual, but people up there have been witnessing them _ and small changes are adding up to big changes."LiNeBrEaKWhile sales of "The Last Polar Bear" suggest it's not, as Kazlowski said, "a barnburner," the timing of its release may turn out to be fortuitous.LiNeBrEaKIn May, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne announced polar bears would be listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, concluding the sea ice vital to polar bear survival had melted dramatically in recent decades _ with more expected.LiNeBrEaKAn animal losing its habitat to climate change had never been listed before. Polar bears use sea ice as a platform to trap their primary prey, seals. The listing followed a prediction six months earlier by scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey that only a small portion of the world's 25,000 polar bears would remain by mid-century, with two-thirds of the world's polar bears disappearing, mostly along the coasts of Alaska and Russia.LiNeBrEaKThe timing is totally coincidental," said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist Steven Amstrap, who has studied polar bears for decades and consulted with Kazlowski on the book. "He's been working on this project a long time."LiNeBrEaKThere's been plenty of work and plenty of sweat _ even in the Arctic.LiNeBrEaKKazlowski initially slept in and worked out of a 1981 Buick station wagon for weeks at a time. "Then he got an old pickup that had a camper on it, but the heater didn't work. He stayed in it for about five years," said Larry Wagner, an Anchorage mechanic who helped keep Kazlowski's vehicles running.LiNeBrEaKKazlowski washed dishes for a living in Kaktovik to get to know the community better and earn his keep.LiNeBrEaKAnd he was slapped on the back by a polar bear cub.LiNeBrEaK"This one mother, she (surprisingly) left the cubs with me to go feed," he said. "I felt something touch my back. They were playing tag, and this one, a 60-pound cub, wanted to tag me. It dropped down and ran off, wanting me to chase it."LiNeBrEaKIn retrospect, that was humorous. But overall, Kazlowski's book sounds an alarm that the polar bear's world is melting beneath its feet. Photos like the one of mother and cub forming crossing a barren sweep of ice invite readers into this frigid world where only the determined and durable survive.LiNeBrEaK"For me photography isn't about going to the spots everybody else is going to because they're getting good pictures," Kazlowski said. "I've always tried to go to these out-of-the-way places where I could find something different."LiNeBrEaKSHRINKING POPULATIONLiNeBrEaKThere are 19 polar bear sub-populations worldwide, Amstrup noted, totaling what most biologists believe to be 20,000-25,000 animals. For some of the groups, there are good population estimates; for others, "not even educated guesses.LiNeBrEaK"Regardless of the number of bears there now, there will be fewer bears there in the future," he said. "There will be a decline, but it won't be the same everywhere across the Arctic."LiNeBrEaKScientists like Amstrup aren't alone in noting changes. In a section of the book of which Kazlowski is particularly proud, editor Christine Clifton-Thornton interviews Arnold Brower Sr., captain of the ABC whaling crew in Barrow. Brower died this October at age 86 when his snowmachine went through the ice; although he managed to pull himself out of the water, Brower couldn't make the walk back to his cabin.LiNeBrEaK"The ice is not the same as it used to be," he told Clifton-Thornton. "The old ice that used to pile up and anchor out there, is missing. It's disappearing. There's more water than ice now.LiNeBrEaK"Here's my question," he said. "What's really happening? Something is wrong. Maybe the whole world is sick."LiNeBrEaKWhile the shortest essay in the book, Kazlowski considers it critical.LiNeBrEaK"I felt that there was a big hole in the project without it," he said.LiNeBrEaK"It's the most important essay in a sense because it comes from a person who walks the walk and talks the talk."LiNeBrEaK'AMAZING' IMAGESLiNeBrEaKThe physical size of "The Last Polar Bear," 12-by-1014 inches, suggests coffee-table book, and there's no doubt the extra space gives Kazlowski's photographs more wallop.LiNeBrEaK"I did a coffee-table book before where the publishers added some stock photography to my story," said Charles Wolhforth, one of the essayists who contributed to "The Last Polar Bear."LiNeBrEaK"But this book had a very serious mission behind it and such an emphasis on quality. In that way, it's not at all a coffee-table book."LiNeBrEaKWolhforth, the author who is a former Anchorage assemblyman and Daily News reporter, was particularly impressed with Kazlowski, even though the two never met face to face.LiNeBrEaK"The images he came up with were just amazing. And the way he did it was the old-fashioned way, without much money and really getting to know the people and the place.LiNeBrEaK"I have a lot respect for that."LiNeBrEaKLike Wohlforth, author of "The Whale and the Supercomputer: On the Northern Front of Climate Change," Kazlowski believes changes are coming rapidly to the Arctic.LiNeBrEaK"You can see it from one season to the next. Open water in the Chukchi Sea, cabins washing off barrier islands.... The most favorable places are disappearing from under (the polar bears') feet."LiNeBrEaKBut perhaps they will simply adapt.LiNeBrEaKA new study by researcher Robert Rockwell of the American Museum of Natural History in the journal Polar Biology points out polar bears survived a period of significant global warming 125,000 years ago when the sea level was 12 to 18 feet higher.LiNeBrEaKThey did it, Rockwell wrote, by changing their diet as the climate changed.LiNeBrEaKRockwell suggests that might happen again in parts of the Arctic around western Hudson Bay where, he says, the ice pack's breakup will coincide with the time snow geese lay their eggs.LiNeBrEaKA diet of eggs from 40 goose nests can replace the energy bears gain from a day of hunting seals, he says.LiNeBrEaKBut Kazlowski has his doubts. The environment, he fears, is changing too quickly to adapt.LiNeBrEaK"Even though the bears are powerful swimmers," he said, "they're not meant to swim for hundreds of miles between ice floes. And you have a lot more rough ice too, so they're not just climbing over pressure ridges. Cubs, I fear, are going to have a lot of trouble negotiating all the changes."LiNeBrEaKVisit the Anchorage Daily News online at http://www.adn.com/LiNeBrEaKTO SUBSCRIBE TO ADVENTURELiNeBrEaKItems in the Adventure package are not included in your MCT News Service subscription.

The Boston Globe 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday   FIRST EDITION	In a glass by itself  	FOOD; Pg. G3  	437 words  	G FORCE|VINCENT CHAPERONLiNeBrEaKChampagne producer Moet and Chandon's prestige label is Cuvee Dom Perignon. Dom - as it is familiarly known - is a vintage Champagne, which means it's made only in exceptional years. Launched in the midst of a worldwide depression in 1936, the super-luxe, super-pricey sparkler was nonetheless an instant hit and showed the way for other elite Champagne brands. These days the man responsible for keeping Dom on top of the world is 32-year-old Vincent Chaperon, a native of Bordeaux with degrees in mineralogy and agronomy who "grew up drinking red wine, not Champagne." Chaperon was in Boston recently to meet retailers, conduct a wine dinner or two, and talk about the challenges involved in selling gem-quality bubbly in a buddy-can-you-spare-a-dime economy. LiNeBrEaKQ. How many vineyards make a contribution to Cuvee Dom Perignon?LiNeBrEaKA. Fourteen grand cru vineyards with 40 to 50 percent of the wine coming from a core of nine plots, and some [premier cru vineyards] right around the abbey where Dom Perignon was cellarmaster in the 17th century.LiNeBrEaKQ. How would you describe what you are trying to accomplish with each release?LiNeBrEaKA. Dom is about balance but with tension, so we aim to bring opposites together: freshness and maturity; intensity and delicacy for example. We are not interested in power. When wine is harmonious it makes an impact. We want to caress the palate.LiNeBrEaKQ. Is global warming having an effect on the quality of Champagne?LiNeBrEaKA. It's definitely a reality. If you look at the last 20 years, we are harvesting earlier and earlier. In 2003, we harvested in August for the first time ever. Actually, Champagne will probably be impacted in a good way. We're in a better position than other places to take advantage of a warming trend.LiNeBrEaKQ. How will parent company LVMH deal with the increasing demand for Dom from the new class of luxury consumers in Russia and China? Do you bring on additional but inevitably less worthy vineyards?LiNeBrEaKA. In Champagne everyone is looking for more grapes, but we are still dealing with the same pool of plots. Dom is guided by the quality of its grapes and vineyards. There must be no compromise.LiNeBrEaKQ. What are retail prices for the Dom portfolio?LiNeBrEaKA. 2000 Cuvee Dom Perignon Brut is around $150; 1995 Cuvee Dom Perignon Oenotheque around $400; 1998 Cuvee Dom Perignon Rose around $450.LiNeBrEaKQ. What do you say to people who object that spending this kind of money on a bottle of wine right now is inappropriate?LiNeBrEaKA. Authenticity is more important today than ever. People are looking for an ideal. Our ambition, as winemakers, is to share with them, through our wine, our values and dreams.

The Charlotte Observer (North Carolina)  	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	Squirrels need a bailout, too: Tough Easter in '07 killed off acorn crop, which means hungry critters are scavenging.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	721 words  	Dec. 31--Even the squirrels are falling on hard times.LiNeBrEaKTheir prime winter entree -- acorns -- are in short supply, particularly in Charlotte, where red oak trees appear to be on reproductive strike.LiNeBrEaKTheir counterparts in the white oak family have dropped a bumper crop. But white oaks are mostly country trees.LiNeBrEaKIn the city, red oaks -- primarily willow oaks -- command 75 percent of the oak canopy. LiNeBrEaKSo, as winter sets in, expect city squirrels to be attacking your bird feeders with greater aggression.LiNeBrEaK"There's a red oak hanging over my office," said UNC Charlotte biologist Larry Mellichamp, who runs the school's greenhouse. "It has a flat tin roof, and for three weeks in autumn the acorns drop on that tin roof and drive me to such distraction I want to go out and cut the tree down.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think I've heard the first acorn drop this year."LiNeBrEaKMellichamp and Bruce Fraedrich, a plant pathologist for the Bartlett Tree Co., say the culprit is the Easter Sunday freeze of 2007.LiNeBrEaKIt takes a red oak two years to produce acorns. White oaks are yearly acorn bearers. Just as Charlotte's red oaks were flowering in April 2007, the temperature dropped below 20 and blooms withered.LiNeBrEaK"If they had flowered normally in '07, we would be having acorns in great abundance," Fraedrich said. "The flowers just never pollinated. A lot of animals are going to find leaner times this winter."LiNeBrEaKFrom a mush to noneLiNeBrEaKUsually this time of year, the top of Charlotte lawyer Martin Hunter's driveway is a mush of crushed acorns, fallen from a willow oak that towers over the driveway and his neighbor's house.LiNeBrEaK"I've not seen a one this fall," Hunter said. "Usually they drop on my cars and sound like ping-pong balls. When I didn't hear them and we weren't crushing them with the cars, I started to wonder if global warming was getting the acorns, too.LiNeBrEaK"When things aren't the way they're supposed to be, you begin to worry."LiNeBrEaKUsually, his yard is full of squirrels.LiNeBrEaKNot now.LiNeBrEaKHunter keeps his bird feeders well-supplied, and he doesn't plan on scattering food for squirrels.LiNeBrEaK"I won't shoo them away as much this winter," he said. "I'm no big fan of squirrels, but I don't want them to suffer.LiNeBrEaK"They'll be getting a winter bird seed bailout."LiNeBrEaKIn the front yard of Bill and Ellen Archer's Cotswold home is a sweeping shumard oak, a member of the red oak family.LiNeBrEaKMost falls, it drops acorns as big as marshmallows.LiNeBrEaK"I don't believe I've seen a single shumard oak acorn," Ellen Archer said. "Other trees are having a robust fruiting year. But the red oaks aren't.LiNeBrEaK"It's like: First, the stock market. Now, this."LiNeBrEaKAfter Archer realized the acorns weren't dropping, she hung an extra feeder in the yard and filled it with sunflower seed, which squirrels devour. She's also crammed dog biscuits in a suet feeder for them to gnaw on.LiNeBrEaKShe's more worried about the other animals that can't get to bird feeders -- like possums, raccoons and deer. For them, she delivers platters of kitchen scraps to a compost pile. "Every day we add to the pile," she said. "So all the critters will have something to nibble on when we get some real winter."LiNeBrEaKNever a sure thingLiNeBrEaKBy now, squirrels and other animals such as bears and deer should have foraged for acorns and stored their winter food. In fall, squirrels begin eating and storing food to survive the winter.LiNeBrEaKThey eat other foods, but their main winter diet is acorns.LiNeBrEaKYet, even with white oaks, acorn production fluctuates year to year. The healthiest and largest oaks can't accumulate enough food and energy to produce strong crops two straight years.LiNeBrEaKThe red oak's failed acorn crop could mean two things: fewer squirrels in Charlotte come spring and fewer young willow oaks because their seeds weren't available for squirrels to disperse.LiNeBrEaK"The lesson here is to diversify the urban forest in case one variety has a hard year," Mellichamp said. "You just can't depend on a bumper crop of nuts or fruits every year."

Contra Costa Times (California) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	Piedmont briefs  	MY TOWN; Alameda; Oakland-Berkeley; News; Local  	908 words  	City seeks survey responsesLiNeBrEaKBetter access to public transit. More and safer bike lanes. City-funded home efficiency upgrades. Photovoltaic systems on city buildings. Water efficiency requirements for new landscapes and construction. These are a few of the measures favored by early respondents to the city's Climate Action Plan survey.LiNeBrEaKYet only a small percentage of Piedmonters have submitted responses. "The city is in the process of preparing a Climate Action Plan, but it is important for Piedmonters to let the city know what they want in the plan, so it will be more responsive to the community," said assistant planner Kevin Jackson. The city is asking all Piedmonters to participate, including school-age children as well as adults. LiNeBrEaKThe on-line survey, available on the city website at www.ci.piedmont.ca.us, asks for community input on issues related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions as part of the city's climate protection efforts. The survey is electronic in order to reduce paper consumption, and thereby reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, for those without a computer, paper versions of the survey are available at the Public Works and City Clerk counters at City Hall or by calling the Department of Public Works at 420-3050.LiNeBrEaK"Preparing a Climate Action Plan demonstrates the city's leadership in responding to human-induced climate change," said Teddy King, head of Piedmont's Environmental Task Force and member of the Piedmont Parks Commission.LiNeBrEaKThe survey, which is open to all residents and business owners regardless of age or computer access, is mostly multiple-choice questions with opportunities for elaboration. It takes about 5 to 10 minutes to complete and will be available through early 2009.LiNeBrEaKTo complete the survey and learn more about the Climate Action Planning process, visit the city website at www.ci.piedmont.ca.us. To request a paper copy of the survey, call the Department of Public Works at 420-3050.LiNeBrEaKRegion fails soot standardLiNeBrEaKThe air that people breathe in the Bay Area fails to meet a new health standard for soot, a problem partly caused by wood smoke and diesel vehicles, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has declared.LiNeBrEaKThe ruling announced last week gives the nine-county Bay Area Air Quality Management District three years to come up with a plan to meet the standard for small particle pollution, which can contribute to a variety of lung and heart problems, including asthma and strokes.LiNeBrEaKThe air district, which expected the ruling, already has begun several measures to reduce particle pollution, said Lisa Fasano, an air district spokeswoman.LiNeBrEaKFor the first time this winter, the air district has banned wood fires in fireplaces and stoves. Wood smoke accounts for up to a third of the soot in the Bay Area on dirty-air nights, the air district estimates.LiNeBrEaK  Denis CuffLiNeBrEaKProject Plasma contestLiNeBrEaKProject: Plasma is offering blood donors an opportunity to bring home a plasma HDTV just in time for kickoff of the big game.LiNeBrEaKYou might not be able to do much to improve the comfort of that Reagan-era sofa with the flat cushions and exposed armrests. And you probably can't increase the flavor of that third-generation recipe for seven-layer dip. But for a little blood you might be able to do something about that old television set.LiNeBrEaKThrough Jan. 23, as part of the Project Plasma promotion, all presenting donors with the American Red Cross can enter a raffle for a new 42-inch plasma HDTV.

Contra Costa Times (California) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	Piedmont briefs  	MY TOWN; Alameda; Oakland-Berkeley; News; Local  	908 words  	City seeks survey responsesLiNeBrEaKBetter access to public transit. More and safer bike lanes. City-funded home efficiency upgrades. Photovoltaic systems on city buildings. Water efficiency requirements for new landscapes and construction. These are a few of the measures favored by early respondents to the city's Climate Action Plan survey.LiNeBrEaKYet only a small percentage of Piedmonters have submitted responses. "The city is in the process of preparing a Climate Action Plan, but it is important for Piedmonters to let the city know what they want in the plan, so it will be more responsive to the community," said assistant planner Kevin Jackson. The city is asking all Piedmonters to participate, including school-age children as well as adults. LiNeBrEaKThe on-line survey, available on the city website at www.ci.piedmont.ca.us, asks for community input on issues related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions as part of the city's climate protection efforts. The survey is electronic in order to reduce paper consumption, and thereby reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, for those without a computer, paper versions of the survey are available at the Public Works and City Clerk counters at City Hall or by calling the Department of Public Works at 420-3050.LiNeBrEaK"Preparing a Climate Action Plan demonstrates the city's leadership in responding to human-induced climate change," said Teddy King, head of Piedmont's Environmental Task Force and member of the Piedmont Parks Commission.LiNeBrEaKThe survey, which is open to all residents and business owners regardless of age or computer access, is mostly multiple-choice questions with opportunities for elaboration. It takes about 5 to 10 minutes to complete and will be available through early 2009.LiNeBrEaKTo complete the survey and learn more about the Climate Action Planning process, visit the city website at www.ci.piedmont.ca.us. To request a paper copy of the survey, call the Department of Public Works at 420-3050.LiNeBrEaKRegion fails soot standardLiNeBrEaKThe air that people breathe in the Bay Area fails to meet a new health standard for soot, a problem partly caused by wood smoke and diesel vehicles, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has declared.LiNeBrEaKThe ruling announced last week gives the nine-county Bay Area Air Quality Management District three years to come up with a plan to meet the standard for small particle pollution, which can contribute to a variety of lung and heart problems, including asthma and strokes.LiNeBrEaKThe air district, which expected the ruling, already has begun several measures to reduce particle pollution, said Lisa Fasano, an air district spokeswoman.LiNeBrEaKFor the first time this winter, the air district has banned wood fires in fireplaces and stoves. Wood smoke accounts for up to a third of the soot in the Bay Area on dirty-air nights, the air district estimates.LiNeBrEaK  Denis CuffLiNeBrEaKProject Plasma contestLiNeBrEaKProject: Plasma is offering blood donors an opportunity to bring home a plasma HDTV just in time for kickoff of the big game.LiNeBrEaKYou might not be able to do much to improve the comfort of that Reagan-era sofa with the flat cushions and exposed armrests.

Contra Costa Times (California) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	Transit blunders and bouquets of 2008  	COMMUTING; News  	978 words  	Real estate plummeted, banks crashed and unemployment soared, but as the Bay Area watched house prices, credit ratings and job security go down the drain, at least one thing went right: 2008 was a Public Transit Party.LiNeBrEaKPeople hopped the bus, jumped the train and caught the BART in record-breaking numbers, sparing the environment and their wallets in the face of high gas prices. As a final coup, voters passed Prop. 1A, authorizing $9. 95 billion to construct a statewide high-speed rail in November. Of course, it wasn't all gravy, but overall, transit rocked and rolled.LiNeBrEaKHere's the rundown on the best and worst moments of the year. The envelope, please: LiNeBrEaKIn the public transit highlight of 2008, demonstrating a truly heroic commitment to public transportation, Jessica Bennett walked seven blocks to the south Hayward BART station Nov. 21 to get to the hospital to have her baby.LiNeBrEaKOr rather, she tried to, but baby Jada had other ideas, and Bennett gave birth shortly afterward at the San Leandro station.LiNeBrEaKBART spokesman Linton Johnson described this as his personal high point of the year, but did not comment whether Bennett was charged an additional fare for the baby.LiNeBrEaKAnd speaking of increasing ridership, after decades of unsuccessfully begging, wooing, seducing and cajoling commuters to eschew their cars, transit agencies scored like rock stars in 2008. Like high school boys getting lucky for the first time, they couldn't stop talking about it, issuing copious press releases and competing over who was getting the most (riders, that is).LiNeBrEaKTurns out the Capitol Corridor train running between Sacramento (well, Auburn, to be exact) and San Jose is the No. 1 Public Transit Stud for 2008, racking up a 33 percent increase in ridership this July, to 161,731 passengers.LiNeBrEaK"That smashed all previous records and I don't think there's any other transit system in the Bay Area that can match that," gloated Luna Salaver, who acts as a spokeswoman for both the Capitol Corridor and BART.LiNeBrEaK"From that 33 percent we calculated those riders prevented 6,020 pounds of smog pollutants and 3,922 pounds of greenhouse gases just in the month of July."LiNeBrEaKThe County Connection saw ridership increases of at least 10 percent a month every month in 2008, according to General Manager Rick Ramacier, with a 24 percent jump in September.LiNeBrEaKThough the rate slowed in the fall, average weekday ridership on BART grew all year, hitting 370,502 passengers in Contra Costa, Alameda, San Francisco and Solano counties in October.LiNeBrEaK"Bay Area residents showed characteristic flexibility and resilience in the face of high gas prices during the first half of 2008, resulting in record ridership on BART, a big shift to carpooling and widespread use of public transportation," said John Goodwin of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a Bay Area planning agency for roads and transit.LiNeBrEaKAs to the low points, in a cruel irony, just as thousands flocked to public transit, agencies saw their funds slashed by the state.LiNeBrEaK"When you succeed, you're supposed to be rewarded, not punished," observed Ramacier. "We've lost about $3 million in this year's 2008 budget alone and that's on top of losses in three of the last four years." The cuts forced the County Connection to raise fares and reduce service. BART and AC Transit also saw their funding drop.LiNeBrEaKDespite budget worries, commuters came through at the ballot box.LiNeBrEaK"The No. 1 (moment) is voters' continued support for transit such as the high-speed rail, BART to San Jose, SMART and the AC Transit operating fund increase," said Goodwin.LiNeBrEaKThis is similar to the Great Depression of the 1930s, when voters had the foresight to vote for projects like the Golden Gate Bridge, the Caldecott Tunnel and the Bay Bridge.LiNeBrEaKThe four projects will make it easier to avoid AC Transit rate increases, not to mention the dreaded commute to San Jose from the East Bay, Highway 101 traffic and the dreary drive to Los Angeles via Interstate Highway 5.LiNeBrEaKNearly 72 percent of voters in the area served by AC Transit actually voted to double their own parcel taxes to stave off AC Transit rate hikes, effective Jan. 1. Those voters approved Measure VV, doubling a parcel tax from $48 to $96 a year in almost all of the district.LiNeBrEaKAC Transit board members and transit advocates said passage of the measure was necessary to cover higher operating costs and forestall fare increases or service cuts.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, residents of Marin and Sonoma counties got SMART, also known as the Sonoma"Marin Area Rail Transit project. Voters in those counties approved Measure Q, which involved plans for a passenger train and pathway project connecting the wine country to San Francisco Bay.LiNeBrEaKWhile Marin and Sonoma counties got SMART, Silicon Valley commuters got BART, or at least some help in that direction. Voters in Santa Clara County approved Measure B, which increases their sales tax by one-eighth of a cent to raise money for a long-planned BART project expanding service from Fremont to San Jose.LiNeBrEaKOn the downside, this was a long time in coming and the recent measure won't go into effect until an agreement is reached on federal funding. Still, it's progress.LiNeBrEaKAnd, speaking of progress, the crown jewel of these projects is the high-speed rail, designated, fittingly enough, Proposition 1A in the November election. Bullet trains zooming up to 220 mph will link San Francisco and Los Angeles in as little as two and a half hours if and when the project is completed. The approximately 800-mile system would also serve Sacramento, San Jose, Fresno and San Diego.LiNeBrEaKIt's worth noting that this year's high points all stemmed from commuters: Higher ridership, funds for new projects and, of course, literally bringing new life to public transit courtesy of Jessica Bennett. Only time will tell whether 2009 will top these highs and lows.LiNeBrEaKReach Janis Mara at 925-952-2671 or jmara@bayareanewsgroup.com	URBAN TRANSIT SYSTEMS (90%); PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION (90%); REAL ESTATE (79%); OIL and GAS PRICES (78%); EMISSIONS (76%); AIR POLLUTION (76%); CLIMATE CHANGE (76%); HIGH SPEED TRAINS (72%); SMOG (71%); HOME PRICES (78%)  		SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (95%); SACRAMENTO, CA, USA (79%); SAN JOSE, CA, USA (79%); SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (95%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	January 2, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved  	By Janis Mara Staff Writer

Dayton Daily News (Ohio) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	Ohio and U.S. interests converge  	OPINIONS; Pg. A13  	565 words  	This is the time of year when news organizations like to name the top 10 stories of the year, at both the national and local levels. What's striking about this year's effort in Ohio - well, one of the striking things - is how many stories contend for both lists.LiNeBrEaK* General Motors announces that it's closing its last plant in the Dayton area, then speeds up the timetable, then speeds it up again, getting the project done in the same calendar year as the announcement. LiNeBrEaKNext thing we know, the whole country is caught up in a story that involves the possibility of GM itself going under.LiNeBrEaK* The economy hits the worst skids ever seen by most people now alive. The governor of Ohio has to cut the state's budget substantially, again and again, affecting the lives of many struggling people. The incoming president signals that he will spend huge amounts of federal money to get things moving again.LiNeBrEaKThe next thing we know, the governor of Ohio is petitioning Washington to simply help pay the state's bills.LiNeBrEaK* The country holds a presidential election, and ... Well, you don't have to be told how Ohio figured in that (or that the outcome was perhaps the most historic event of a historic year). But it's relevant to note that the political patterns in Ohio followed those of the nation: Democrats gained control of the Ohio delegation to Congress, as well as control of the Ohio House of Representatives. They even retained the attorney generalship of Ohio after having been humiliated by the performance of Democrat Marc Dann.LiNeBrEaK* And, as if the political and economic realms did not show dramatically enough how Ohioans are in the same boat with the rest of the country, there was also Hurricane Ike. After it hit the Gulf Coast - with the whole world captivated by the possibility of another hurricane involving New Orleans - the next thing we know, Dayton is darkened by a historic windstorm.LiNeBrEaKActually, that, too, is a political issue, if you accept that global-warming plays a role in hurricanes.LiNeBrEaKBut let's get back to the economic realm. This was the year when the rest of the country joined Ohio and Michigan in despair over the economy. Throughout this decade, when Ohio had bad economic statistics - about, say, job growth or income growth - other parts of the country were looking better, at least in some ways.LiNeBrEaKBut that was partly the result of what turned out to be a housing "bubble," that is, absurd increases in the value of real estate. When the bubble burst - resulting in the collapse of national and local financial institutions - all of a sudden gloomy Ohioans had plenty of company.LiNeBrEaKNow Washington is sounding more and more like a state capital (except that it doesn't have to balance its budget). It's focused in state-like ways on creating and saving jobs.LiNeBrEaKOhio Gov. Bob Taft pushed for his New Frontier program to foster hightech jobs.LiNeBrEaKGov. Ted Strickland joined with Republicans to direct money into a long-term "stimulus" package designed to create jobs (along with other jobs-oriented initiatives).LiNeBrEaKNow President-elect Barack Obama wants - as a centerpiece of his economic policy - to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars to pay salaries for people doing new public works.LiNeBrEaKHe is not settling for the indirect approach: manipulating tax policy to stimulate the economy, in the way of recent presidents. Now it's about creating jobs directly.LiNeBrEaKOhio welcomes Washington to its world.

A7  	398 words  	Public employee payLiNeBrEaKCitizens should have respect for members of the police department considering the professionalism and the stress and working conditions in their job.LiNeBrEaKAfter the promotion of Kevin Belk to the Grand Rapids police chief position, operations have improved and he and the department deserve commendation for the professionalism and accomplishment of the department. But I am dismayed reading an article in The Grand Rapids Press stating that city police officers will receive a pay increase of 4. 5 percent next month and an additional 3 percent pay raise on July 1, for a total increase of 7. 5 percent. I am aware they will now be responsible for a small percent of health care cost. LiNeBrEaKWe have a serious condition existing in the United States and particularly in Michigan. We are suffering a serious deflation and an unemployment rate of 10 percent in Michigan. In addition to the huge number of persons unemployed in this state, many who are still working have had their wages decreased.LiNeBrEaKPeople who are still working should feel fortunate that they are still getting wages. Public employees should live by the same standards as the rest of society. City taxes should be reduced in the proportion of the decrease in the general economy. We need to keep a full complement of police but the police still should appreciate that they still are employed and getting wages.LiNeBrEaKGERALD FOY/Grand RapidsLiNeBrEaKWinter mathLiNeBrEaKLet me get this straight. On the front page of the Dec. 23 Press, it says 43 inches of snow (about three times the normal late-December total) have fallen so far this month, yet the Kent County Road Commission has only used a third of the salt that would be used so far in a normal winter and a third of the available maintenance budget -- and what's more, KCRC supervisor Jerry Byrne says he feels "comfortable" with this numerical imbalance?LiNeBrEaKI doubt I'm the only person who finds Byrne's math un-comfortable, if not downright unnerving.LiNeBrEaKHOLLY M.

A3  	250 words  	SAULT STE. MARIE -- A movie about a "maverick," his journey "from Wall Street to Main Street," his "desperate search" for a "monkey" and a "game-changing" revelation about his "carbon footprint" probably would make the nation's word-watchers physically ill. LiNeBrEaKEspecially if it were the "winner of five nominations."LiNeBrEaKAll those words and phrases are on Lake Superior State University's annual List of Words to Be Banished from the Queen's English for Mis-use, Over-use and General Uselessness. The 34th version of the list was released Tuesday, which means, "It's that time of year again."LiNeBrEaKThe school in Michigan's Upper Peninsula selected 15 entries from about 5,000 nominations.LiNeBrEaKDespite the year's economic meltdown (which itself wasn't banished but don't rule it out for next year), the most entries came from the environmental category -- for "green" or "going green."LiNeBrEaK"If I see one more corporation declare itself 'green,' I'm going to start burning tires in my backyard," wrote Ed Hardiman of Bristow, Va., in his submission. Nominators also had their fill of "carbon footprint" -- the amount of greenhouse gases an individual's lifestyle produces.LiNeBrEaKThe list wasn't overrun with politics despite the national election -- no "change," for instance -- but one simply couldn't escape the critics' wrath.LiNeBrEaK"I'm a maverick, he's a maverick, wouldn't you like to be a maverick, too?" offered Michael Burke of Silver Spring, Md., in his entry for the label embraced by Republican presidential candidate John McCain.

Grunion Gazette (Long Beach, California)  	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	Whale Watching Excursions Now At Aquarium of Pacific  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	548 words  	Dec. 31--The ocean's leviathans are parading in ocean waters off the coast of Long Beach, and people are encouraged to come cheer them on.LiNeBrEaKThe Aquarium of the Pacific once again has started up its whale watching tours, allowing guests the opportunity to witness the marine mammals as they migrate through the sea. Whale Watch Coordinator Alicia Archer said the experience teaches participants through both firsthand visuals as well as educational resources.LiNeBrEaK"The diversity off of our coast is incredible," she said. "Local residents used to urban life can check out what's in their own backyard." LiNeBrEaKDaily boat excursions feature discussions by field experts as well as admission to the aquarium. Visitors who take a trip to the aquarium can view the "Whales: Voices in the Sea" exhibit as well as the "Whales: A Journey with Giants" film. Meanwhile, guests aboard the boat will get a close look at marine mammal artifacts, such as whalebones and baleen.LiNeBrEaKCommon sightings include gray, fin, blue and Minke whales, various dolphin species, sea lions, harbor seals and migratory sea birds. On occasion, Archer said, sightseers report orcas.LiNeBrEaK"Orcas were spotted last winter and twice this season, within the last month," she said.LiNeBrEaKTours travel a few miles offshore to designated sites known for sightings. Each trip takes place aboard a Harbor Breeze Cruises catamaran and begins with a summary of what species might show up.LiNeBrEaKAs of right now, she said, many gray whales are making their way on a 12,000-mile roundtrip south from the Bering Sea. Warmer waters, she said, give baby calves a better chance at survival.LiNeBrEaK"They start about October and take six to eight weeks, traveling 85 to 100 miles per day," she said. "Their northbound peak is in April."LiNeBrEaKThat, she explained, is why the aquarium offers tours on a regular basis. Recent tours, however, have seen changes in migrating patterns due to climate change issues, she said.LiNeBrEaK"They are searching further and further north for food," she said. "They are taking longer to head home."LiNeBrEaKThe Aquarium of the Pacific features a variety of exhibits about Southern California, Baja, Northern and Tropical Pacific bodies of water. The aquarium began organizing cruises with Harbor Breeze Cruises last year.LiNeBrEaK"We had done other whale watches through other companies, but found that we were searching through other locations when we have enough diversity off our own coast," she said.

Havelock News (North Carolina)  	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	OPINION: I'm making a resolution about resolutions  	COMMENTARY  	596 words  	Dec. 31--I have never been one to put much stock in New Year's. To me, the change from Dec. 31 to Jan. 1 is no different from June 28 to June 29.LiNeBrEaKWhat's the big deal? It's just one day to the next. We do that 364 times a year anyway.LiNeBrEaKYet, I understand the need to examine your past and make plans for the future. LiNeBrEaKStill, why wait until the New Year to do it?LiNeBrEaKThat's why New Year's resolutions have never made much sense to me.LiNeBrEaKSo, with that in mind, here are some of my New Year's resolutions.LiNeBrEaKIn 2009, I resolve not to start smoking.LiNeBrEaKI know. This one will be particularly difficult for me. However, I think if I can manage not to buy any cigarettes in 2009, I think I can not start smoking.LiNeBrEaKAlso, I resolve to get very angry at something in 2009.LiNeBrEaKI have an opportunity to knock this one out pretty early in the year. East Carolina, my alma mater, plays Kentucky in the Liberty Bowl on Friday.LiNeBrEaKKnowing the way the Pirates have played at times this season, I have a feeling that I will get very upset at some point during the football game.LiNeBrEaKHowever, if East Carolina does everything right during the game and I somehow don't get very angry during the game, I do have a backup plan.LiNeBrEaKI figure at some point I am going to get very angry at my dog. She is going to try, at some point, to chew up a pillow from our couch. I always get angry when this happens, and the dog always gets in trouble.LiNeBrEaKStill, for some reason, the dog has failed to learn its lesson, so I'm counting on at least one occasion in 2009 to get very angry at the dog.LiNeBrEaKI resolve to drink alcohol in 2009. I'm not a big drinker, so for me, this will be more difficult than it sounds, especially if the weather isn't good.LiNeBrEaKFor me, it's almost natural to have a beer when I'm grilling steaks on that first warm day of the summer.LiNeBrEaKBut, what if it never warms up? What if we have an unusually cold spring and summer?LiNeBrEaKI just can't drink a beer when I'm wearing gloves on my hands.LiNeBrEaKSo, here's hoping Al Gore is at least a little correct about this whole global warming thing. If not, I may not have an opportunity to drink a beer in 2009, and that would be a shame indeed.LiNeBrEaKI resolve to watch more television and not read as many books.LiNeBrEaKSounds easy? Not so fast.LiNeBrEaKThere are simply not a whole lot of good television programs these days. I despise all these so-called reality shows, which most times have nothing to do reality.LiNeBrEaKIt's harder and harder to find a good situation comedy or a good crime drama that doesn't spend half the show grossing me out by showing images of dead people and their insides.LiNeBrEaKWhile TV programs aren't as good, there always seems to be a good book out there. Trying to get authors to quit writing good books may be quite a challenge.LiNeBrEaKAnd finally, I resolve not to lose any weight in 2009. Heck, if I can manage to put on a few pounds, even better.LiNeBrEaKEveryone always talks about losing weight at New Year's, and trust me, I've got plenty I can lose.LiNeBrEaKBut, losing weight involves exercise, and that's a lot of work.LiNeBrEaKWhy do that when I can grab a beer, enjoy a cigarette and eat chips on my couch while I curse and yell at the television during the East Carolina football game?LiNeBrEaKKen Buday is the editor of the Havelock News.

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada)  	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	Nevada Power steams forward  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	647 words  	Dec. 31--The electric utility serving Las Vegas is preparing to consider its first investment in a geothermal power project in Northern Nevada, using a method just approved by state regulators.LiNeBrEaKNevada Power Co., which does business as NV Energy, plans to enter a joint ownership agreement with Ormat Nevada, a geothermal development company in Reno, for the Carson Lake Geothermal Power Project near Fallon.LiNeBrEaKThe joint ownership agreement only will be entered if Ormat determines it can build a geothermal power plant that will generate 30 megawatts or more of electricity, said NV Energy renewable energy executive Tom Fair. LiNeBrEaKIf Ormat's drilling, which is going on now, indicates a lesser amount of generation capacity, Nevada Power will allow Ormat to develop it as 100 percent owner, Fair said.LiNeBrEaKGeothermal power plants use steam and hot underground water to generate electricity.LiNeBrEaKThe Public Utilities Commission on Monday voted 3-0 to allow Nevada Power to sell power from the Fallon plant to Sierra Pacific Power Co., an affiliated Reno-based utility that also does business as NV Energy.LiNeBrEaKMost of the good geothermal sites are located in Northern Nevada, far from Nevada Power. So the Southern Nevada utility entered the power sales agreement with Sierra Pacific.LiNeBrEaKThe arrangement allows Nevada Power to get renewable credits that can be used to satisfy state minimum requirements for "green" power, although the Southern Nevada utility has no direct connection with Sierra Pacific Power.LiNeBrEaKIn other cases, Nevada Power has contracted to buy geothermal power from independent companies, he said.LiNeBrEaKThe arrangement will become unnecessary when a planned transmission line is built to connect the two utilities, he said.LiNeBrEaKNevada Power also uses solar power from the Nevada Solar One project at Boulder City, but Fair said the utility wants to get a variety of renewable resources, including wind and geothermal power.LiNeBrEaK"No one can say for certain today how these technologies are going to evolve and which is the best," Fair said.LiNeBrEaK"We think geothermal is the most competitive [priced] of the renewable resources," Fair said.LiNeBrEaKUnlike solar and wind power, geothermal plants operate around the clock.LiNeBrEaKState consumer advocate Eric Witkoski welcomed the project as a reliable source of power that, unlike natural gas- and coal-fired plants, creates no carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is believed to cause global warming.LiNeBrEaKIn a separate development, the utilities commission on Monday restarted the regulatory review process for the coal-fired, 1,600-megawatt White Pine Energy Station that LS Power plans to build 30 miles north of Ely.LiNeBrEaKCommission Chairwoman Jo Ann Kelly said the process needs to be started over because the utilities commission didn't have the specific power plant site until the Bureau of Land Management approved the use of federal land for the project this month.LiNeBrEaKThe alternate site would have been 20 miles north of Ely, said Mark Milburn, project development director for LS Power.LiNeBrEaKMilburn expects appeals, potentially by environmental group Western Resource Advocates, of the commission case, a pending application for an air permit and the BLM decision.LiNeBrEaKLS Power and Dynegy Inc. are joint venture partners in the White Pine project, but Dynegy disclosed earlier this month that it was reassessing the project along with other power projects, according to Reuters.LiNeBrEaKDynegy is reviewing siting, permitting, financing and construction of the coal- and natural gas-fired plants.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	Climate change increases problems for Florida reefs: Despite new federal protections, Elkhorn Coral may disappear from the waters off the coast of South Florida  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1105 words  	Dec. 31--The last, largest stands of ancient elkhorn coral survive in shallow waters off North Key Largo, where rough seas sometimes expose thick golden branches reaching toward the sunlit surface.LiNeBrEaKForty years ago, elkhorn grew in dense forests that would cover parking lots. Now, the biggest clump would barely fill one space.LiNeBrEaKIn another 40 years, elkhorn could disappear altogether -- along with just about every other hard coral forming South Florida's once-vibrant barrier reefs. LiNeBrEaKFederal regulators last week designated a 1,329-square-mile strip of sea bottom stretching from southern Palm Beach County to the Dry Tortugas as critical habitat for elkhorn and staghorn corals, two species that have long formed the foundation of barrier reefs off Florida and in the Caribbean.LiNeBrEaKBut a new report by the Environmental Defense Fund and co-authored by two University of Miami scientists argues localized protections will do little to address the biggest threat to reefs.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming is not only accelerating problems that already have sickened and shrunken coral reefs, it has created a new, potentially more lethal threat: Increasingly acidic ocean waters that can reduce living coral to dead rubble.LiNeBrEaKThe report, "Corals and Climate Change: Florida's Natural Treasures at Risk," concludes that 5,000-year-old reefs, which support an array of marine life, will be among the first ecosystems to collapse if greenhouse gas levels continue to rise in the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaK"All of the forecasts show that at the rate we're going that somewhere at the middle or the end of the century, it's going to be very challenging for corals," said Harold Wanless, UM's chairman of geological sciences.LiNeBrEaKWanless, who has studied rising sea levels in South Florida for decades, is one of the report's six co-authors, along with department colleague James Klaus, a UM assistant professor. The others: Terry Gibson, longtime environmental journalist in Florida; Patricia Foster-Turley, wildlife biologist based in Fernandina Beach; and Karen Florini and Thomas Olson, attorneys with the Environmental Defense Fund.LiNeBrEaKGREENHOUSE EMISSIONSLiNeBrEaKJerry Karnas, director of Environmental Defense's Florida climate project, said the report bolsters the case for dramatic state, federal and international steps to reduce greenhouse emissions -- particularly of carbon dioxide -- largely produced by cars and power plants burning fossil fuels.LiNeBrEaK"We're ground zero for impacts," said Karnas, who served on Gov. Charlie Crist's climate action team.LiNeBrEaKThe report doesn't break new ground but it does compile the latest studies of reef decline, threats and ripple effects on both the environment and economy.LiNeBrEaKIt estimates the loss of reefs, which are a magnet for tourists, divers and anglers, would cost 70,000 jobs and $5. 5 billion in sales annually in five southeast counties alone: Miami-Dade, Broward, Monroe, Palm Beach and Martin.LiNeBrEaKStaghorn and elkhorn corals, the first coral species to be listed as threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act in May 2006, came under new federal protection issued last week.LiNeBrEaKOnce the major reef builders in South Florida's shallow barrier reefs, the large corals, whose stalks resemble the horns of their animal namesakes, have declined by as much as 97 percent off the Florida Keys and the Caribbean. Scattered colonies also have been found off Broward and Palm Beach counties.LiNeBrEaKLast month, the National Marine Fisheries Service issued new regulations focused on direct human damage from anchoring, groundings, fishing, pollution and collection -- similar to protections already in place in the Florida Keys National Marine Keys sanctuary.LiNeBrEaKThe agency followed up last week by designating waters less than 30 feet deep off the Southeast coast -- from Boynton Beach to the Dry Tortugas -- as critical habitat for the corals. It's only about a third the size originally proposed, eliminating sections of Florida Bay and northern waters where the agency ruled the corals have not been historically found.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists and many scientists argue the new protections don't address broader and increasing assaults on reefs, including assorted diseases and bouts of coral bleaching -- a whitening that can weaken corals.LiNeBrEaKBleaching, linked to warming ocean temperatures, is just one of threat posed by climate change. Another one call ocean "acidification" is a potentially far more damaging, said Chris Langdon, a professor at UM's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.LiNeBrEaKA NEW STRESSORLiNeBrEaK"This is a new stressor over and on top of everything you have heard about already," said Langdon, whose is among several UM scientists who have chronicled rising acidity in oceans.LiNeBrEaKSimply put, oceans absorb much of the atmosphere's excess carbon dioxide, where it dissolves. The resulting rise in the acidity of sea water -- it's jumped 30 percent over the last century -- can cripple corals, which are particularly sensitive to changes in temperature, light and chemistry.LiNeBrEaKIt hinders polyps -- the tiny living animals inside coral -- from processing calcium, an essential component to building the hard coral skeleton that shelter them and build reefs. As ocean acidity increases, Langdon said, the rates of coral growth and reproduction slow and the swaths of the ocean where they can survive shrink.LiNeBrEaKThe coral itself also becomes thinner, more brittle and vulnerable to disease, hurricanes, human damage and natural parasites. Wanless likened what can happened to weakened or damaged reefs to "termites going at a complex of wood." Corals can literally dissolve into calcified sediment.LiNeBrEaKIf carbon dioxide emissions aren't curtailed, the threats add up to what Langdon called a "perfect storm" that could destroy much of the world's reefs -- perhaps within four to five decades.LiNeBrEaKWanless considers a four- to six-foot rise in sea level almost unavoidable over the next 50 to 100 years, an increase that would inundate the Everglades and hundreds of millions worth of coastal real estate. But he believes there is still time to prevent far more catastrophic damage -- if people and policymakers will only pay closer attention to what already is happening just a few miles offshore.LiNeBrEaK"People just can't imagine the world changing as it may this century," he said.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday   01 EDITION	Warren pick says a lot about Obama  	A; Pg. 11  	824 words  	Warren pick says a lot about ObamaLiNeBrEaKBy PETER S. CANELLOSLiNeBrEaKThe Boston GlobeLiNeBrEaKMany of the Obamaphiles streaming into Washington for the inauguration will be looking for one type of president: the dynamic agent of change, ready to end the pain of the Bush years and usher in a liberal reformation.LiNeBrEaKBut Barack Obama seems determined to give them another type of president: a figure of national consensus, wise and honorable and able to soar above the political fray. LiNeBrEaKObama the candidate showed flashes of both approaches to leadership, and many voters were drawn to the idea that he might be the most liberal president in several generations.LiNeBrEaKBut it now seems clear that the vision of Obama as a liberal activist was the product of a handful of impressions that didn't make up a full picture.LiNeBrEaKThe first was his early opposition to the Iraq war, which led both supporters and opponents to believe he was a dove on foreign policy.LiNeBrEaKThe second was his racial background, which he advertised as proof of his ability to change the story in Washington, which was true enough but led many to believe he would be a full-throated advocate for groups long excluded from power.LiNeBrEaKThe third was his criticism of Bill and Hillary Clinton's politics of "triangulation" - undermining conservative opponents by borrowing some of their positions - which led people to believe he would do no such thing.LiNeBrEaKAll these were honest positions, and he hasn't backed away from them. But they managed to disguise that Obama's policies were no more progressive than Hillary Clinton's - and arguably less so on some issues such as health care.LiNeBrEaKMoreover, his message of inclusion, which many liberals chose to read on their own terms - as an endorsement of gay rights and multiculturalism - was also aimed at red-state conservatives, whose religious values he mostly admired.LiNeBrEaKNow, Obama has nominated a Cabinet of highly familiar figures from a broad range of personal and political backgrounds, which most liberals have found acceptable, if not especially exciting.LiNeBrEaKBut his selection of Rick Warren, the evangelical minister and best-selling author of "The Purpose Driven Life," to deliver the invocation at his inauguration has served as a tip-off that Obama may not be exactly the type of change agent that many liberals have been expecting.LiNeBrEaKThough Warren has millions of followers, he's not especially well known on the national stage, and there is a blurriness about his politics.LiNeBrEaKBy some measures - such as his support for Proposition 8, which passed in November and blocked gay marriage in his native California - he is a figure of the religious right.LiNeBrEaKBut Warren has a more moderate tone than many evangelicals, and has emphasized some liberal concerns, such as the dangers of global warming, along with his conservative social message.LiNeBrEaKPeople who watched the nationally televised presidential forum at Warren's Saddleback Church in August got a hint of what was to come.LiNeBrEaKWarren conducted separate interviews of Obama and John McCain before an audience of church members.LiNeBrEaKObama seemed especially eager to win Warren's approval, repeatedly calling him "Pastor Rick" and offering detailed answers to questions about his spiritual views.LiNeBrEaKObama was also uncharacteristically tongue-tied at times, either because he was trying so hard to sound sincere or because he was straining to win over a skeptical audience.LiNeBrEaKMcCain, by contrast, offered quick, simple answers and won the crowd's approval.LiNeBrEaKWarren, for his part, seemed much more in tune with McCain, despite Obama's entreaties. Nonetheless, it was equally clear, even then, that Obama had identified Warren as someone he wanted to bring into the national discussion.LiNeBrEaKInviting Warren to give the inaugural invocation is not necessarily an endorsement of his political views, as some liberals insist. But it is an endorsement of another sort, giving Warren the chance to play the role of national pastor formerly occupied by Billy Graham.LiNeBrEaKObama is well aware of Warren's politics and the symbolism of his presence on the inaugural stand, and he is clearly signaling his determination to include evangelicals in his government of national unity.LiNeBrEaKObama does not want an administration dedicated to vindicating long-excluded groups, but rather one that shows how those who have been excluded can, once invited inside, become just as mainstream in their skills, credentials and opinions as any member of the East Coast establishment.LiNeBrEaKThe liberals who oppose Obama's choice of a pastor to offer the inaugural invocation may or may not have misjudged Warren, but it seems clear that they have misjudged Obama.LiNeBrEaKPeter S.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday   01 EDITION	Change to Endangered Species Act spurs suit  	A; Pg. 05  	254 words  	Change to Endangered Species Act spurs suitLiNeBrEaKBy JULIE CARTLiNeBrEaKLos Angeles TimesLiNeBrEaKap features,LiNeBrEaKCalifornia Attorney General Jerry Brown filed suit against the federal government Tuesday, charging that a recent rule change by the Bush administration illegally gutted provisions of the Endangered Species Act, essentially quashing the role of science in decisions made by federal agencies. LiNeBrEaKKen Alex, senior assistant attorney general, said the state took the action because it has both the legal right and the moral responsibility to protect California's environment and resources. The new federal rules, he said, could put California's threatened and endangered wildlife in greater jeopardy and ultimately could cost the state more to protect plants and animals on California's Endangered Species List.LiNeBrEaKThe federal rules, made final Dec. 16, eliminated mandated independent scientific review of federal agency plans if the agency determined that the projects posed no threat to protected species. Further, the new rules removed the requirement to consider the effects of greenhouse gases on protected species and their habitat.LiNeBrEaKCritics argued that agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management, which oversees oil and gas leasing on federal land, do not have sufficient scientific expertise to evaluate threats to wildlife. And, they said, the rules would make it more difficult to protect animals such as the polar bear, which was placed on the Endangered Species List because of the effects of climate change on the bear's melting habitat.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday   02 EDITION	Banned words list offers no 'bailout' to offenders  	A; Pg. 02  	717 words  	Banned words list offers no 'bailout' to offendersLiNeBrEaKBy JEFF KAROUBLiNeBrEaKAssociated Press WriterLiNeBrEaKDETROIT - A movie about a "maverick," his journey "from Wall Street to Main Street," his "desperate search" for a "monkey" and a "game-changing" revelation about his "carbon footprint" probably would make the nation's word-watchers physically ill.LiNeBrEaKEspecially if it were the "winner of five nominations." LiNeBrEaKAll those words and phrases are on Lake Superior State University's annual List of Words to Be Banished from the Queen's English for Mis-use, Over-use and General Uselessness. The 34th version of the list was released Tuesday, which means, "It's that time of year again."LiNeBrEaKThe school in Michigan's Upper Peninsula selected 15 entries from about 5,000 nominations.LiNeBrEaKDespite the year's economic meltdown (which itself wasn't banished but don't rule it out for next year), the most entries came from the environmental category - for "green" or "going green."LiNeBrEaK"If I see one more corporation declare itself 'green,' I'm going to start burning tires in my backyard," wrote Ed Hardiman of Bristow, Va., in his submission. Nominators also had their fill of "carbon footprint" - the amount of greenhouse gases an individual's lifestyle produces.LiNeBrEaKThe list wasn't overrun with politics despite the national election - no "change," for instance - but one simply couldn't escape the critics' wrath.LiNeBrEaK"I'm a maverick, he's a maverick, wouldn't you like to be a maverick, too?" offered Michael Burke of Silver Spring, Md., in his entry for the label embraced by unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate John McCain.LiNeBrEaKAlso knocked was "first dude," a term adopted by Todd Palin, husband of McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.LiNeBrEaKWords related to the economy led to a few meltdowns.LiNeBrEaK"I am so tired of hearing about everything affecting 'Main Street.' I know that with the 'Wall Street' collapse, the comparison is convenient, but really, let's find another way to talk about everyman or the middle class, or even, heaven forbid, 'Joe the Plumber.'" wrote Stacey from Knoxville, Tenn. She provided only a first name in her bid to eradicate - or at least separate - "Wall Street" and "Main Street."LiNeBrEaKAlthough this year's sluggish economy and record rise in gas prices may have kept people closer to home, the word coined for it, "staycation," is "idiotic and rootless," says Michele Mooney of Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaKAn emoticon made the list for the first time. The strings of characters used in e-mails and text-messaging commonly represent a face - like ;-) or :-0 - but the school singled out an emoticon heart, formed with a "less than" symbol and the number 3.LiNeBrEaK"Monkey" was on the list because of what some see as its rampant use as a suffix. "Especially on the Internet, many people seem to think they can make any boring name sound more attractive just by adding the word 'monkey' to it," wrote Rogier Landman of Sommerville, Mass.LiNeBrEaKThe school's annual quest to throw lexicon logs on the fire always gets some end-of-the-year attention for the school in Sault Ste. Marie, the last stop before Michigan's northern border crossing with Canada. But the list is more about letting off steam and offering laughs than performing any verbal vanishing act.LiNeBrEaK"We get several nominations for the same word or phrase, and we still get nominations for words and phrases that have been on previous years' lists," said university spokesman Tom Pink.LiNeBrEaK" 'At this point in time' was on the first list in 1976 and it continues to be nominated every year. People still hate it."LiNeBrEaKThink these gendarmes of jargon should "get a life"? Watch it, kiddo. That phrase was banished in 1997.LiNeBrEaKON THE NETLiNeBrEaKLake Superior State University's banished words:LiNeBrEaKwww.lssu.edu/banishedLiNeBrEaKAMY SANCETTA/Associated PressLiNeBrEaKRepublican presidential candidate Sen.

The Orange County Register (California)  	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	Running at night is beautiful. But take certain precautions before venturing outdoors  	LIFESTYLE  	628 words  	ORANGE COUNTY, Calif._When the heck does the sun go down?LiNeBrEaKIt seems no matter when I leave for my bike ride, I get caught out after dark _ a sin as far as I'm concerned.LiNeBrEaKIf you're like me, you've tried commuting by bike during winter. And if you're like me, you've also decided that no matter how many reflectors, headlamps and blinking red lights you use, the danger from traffic is just not worth it.LiNeBrEaKSafety first. Global warming second. LiNeBrEaKConsider the guy on the recumbent bicycle (one of those low slung bikes that look like a chair on wheels) I saw the other week. He had a florescent green-yellow shirt, a reflective triangle on the back of his bike, front and rear lights and an orange flag.LiNeBrEaKMr. Safety.LiNeBrEaKI met Mr. Safety at the corner of Los Alisos Boulevard and Marguerite Parkway in Mission Viejo just after the sun had set. I figured I'd ride just ahead, relying on his lights to keep me alive. Of course, he smoked me and quickly disappeared.LiNeBrEaKPlan B? Ride the sidewalks home. I should add it's illegal in some cities to ride a bike on sidewalks.LiNeBrEaKBut there's a better option for outdoor types to exercise after dark.LiNeBrEaKGo for a run, or walk _ just be careful of the idiot cyclist trying to make his way home on the sidewalk. Pedestrians should take special precautions because there are too many car vs. people accidents at night.LiNeBrEaK_Rule one: Don't run on streets at night. In fact, don't run on streets during the day either.LiNeBrEaKNot only are you tempting fate, there has never been a study I've seen which proves running on concrete sidewalks with running shoes is more harmful than running on "softer" asphalt. So obey the law, and stick to the sidewalks.LiNeBrEaKWhat law, you ask? The little known pedestrian law which makes it illegal to run or walk on a road if there is an adjacent pathway.LiNeBrEaK_Rule two: Stop at intersections before crossing, even if you have the light.LiNeBrEaKMost drivers only focus on the street before turning. They don't look down bike lanes or sidewalks. Plus, they are looking for headlights at night. Assume they don't see you, and assume they are making a right-hand turn.LiNeBrEaKTry for eye contact or get their attention with a small, friendly wave before crossing.LiNeBrEaK_Rule three: Pay attention while crossing.LiNeBrEaKThose big white painted lines are only paint. They won't stop a two-ton mass of metal. If you're not sure about an oncoming car, another friendly wave doesn't hurt. And try to ignore the drivers who like to creep into the sidewalk. Sure they are scofflaws. But this isn't "Midnight Cowboy" and you're no Ratso Rizzo "walking here."LiNeBrEaK_Rule four: Make yourself visible. Ditch the dark clothing for glowing green-yellow threads. Put reflective tape on clothes and shoes. Consider a headlamp or red flashing light.LiNeBrEaKAfter taking precautions, enjoy. With holiday lights decorating homes and businesses, this happens to be one of the best months for night running.LiNeBrEaKJust keep in mind when the sun goes down _ around 4: 40 p.m.LiNeBrEaKVisit the Register on the World Wide Web at http://www.ocregister.com/LiNeBrEaKTO SUBSCRIBE TO ADVENTURELiNeBrEaKItems in the Adventure package are not included in your MCT News Service subscription.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday   Sunrise Edition	Equity reports requested I live in ou  	Editorial; Pg. ELL  	853 words  	Equity reports requestedLiNeBrEaKI live in outer East Portland and just spent a year working with other neighborhood activists and the Portland Planning Department on the East Portland Action Plan for improving livability in East Portland. One of the plan's requests is exactly the kind of equity report that your editorial dismissed ("A mayor in love with numbers," Dec. 29).LiNeBrEaKMayor-elect Sam Adams isn't just piling onto the poor old bureaus, making them crunch numbers for numbers sake. He wants to know if the city is effective in all of Portland's neighborhoods. That is a fair question for a mayor to ask and without the report, there is no way for him to get an answer. LiNeBrEaKThe idea of the Portland Plan becoming the Portland Strategic Plan is a thrifty one in terms of dollars and effort by the city bureaus. It also means that Portland's Strategic Plan is going to be about all of Portland and that is a good thing.LiNeBrEaKA neighborhood equity analysis that is tied to Portland's Strategic Plan has the potential to be very powerful in driving change where it is needed. That would be "activity with progress" and not empty number crunching at all.LiNeBrEaKKATIE LARSELLLiNeBrEaKNortheast PortlandLiNeBrEaKTrash collection fairnessLiNeBrEaKMichelle Cole's piece "Trash out, garbage trucks return," (Dec. 29) tells us that customers shouldn't expect a discount on their monthly bills.LiNeBrEaKWaste Management, the largest single garbage hauler in Portland, bills residential customers in advance, two months at a time.LiNeBrEaKIn mid-November, I paid for the eight weekly pick-ups scheduled through this week. Two of those never happened.LiNeBrEaKI agree that the company will probably not adjust our next bill accordingly, but it seems eminently fair for all of us in the same situation to deduct one-fourth of the next invoice amount for services not rendered.LiNeBrEaKJAMES SHANDLiNeBrEaKSouthwest PortlandLiNeBrEaKPGE fails to leadLiNeBrEaK"PGE confronts dirty dilemma at Boardman," (Dec. 26) tells us a lot about PGE's priorities. Putting profits before public health, PGE is relying on pipe-dream experiments to justify continued operation of its Boardman coal plant --the largest source of global warming pollution in Oregon.LiNeBrEaKInstead of investing in 21st-century technologies, PGE is choosing a self-described, "wait-and-see" approach that puts Oregon ratepayers at unnecessary financial risk. Energy efficiency programs that already exist today can provide energy at less than half the cost of wholesale power.LiNeBrEaKInstead of spending hundreds of millions of dollars to extend our reliance on dirty fossil fuel, PGE should lead by investing in the clean energy resources of the future, including energy-efficiency.LiNeBrEaKCoal is a short-term solution to a long-term problem. It's time for PGE to take on its "dirty dilemma" with a new, clean energy attitude. Oregonians expect more and deserve better.LiNeBrEaKIVAN MALUSKILiNeBrEaKConservation CoordinatorLiNeBrEaKSierra Club, Oregon ChapterLiNeBrEaKTake invocation outLiNeBrEaKRegarding all the uproar about Pastor Rick Warren's role at the upcoming inauguration: I wouldn't be happy unless there were no minister or parson or priest or deacon or bishop or witch doctor or faith agent at all.LiNeBrEaKSeparation of church and state, anyone? This is a political job, not a religious assignment. Theodore Roosevelt didn't take his oath on a Bible. John Quincy Adams used a book of law (nifty, eh?). We elected a national leader --what does an "invocation" have to do with that? It's not about prayer, it's about (or should be) governing.LiNeBrEaKPresident George W. Bush uttering "so help me God" didn't elevate, to my mind, his capabilities or commitment one iota.LiNeBrEaKLANE BROWNINGLiNeBrEaKSouthwest PortlandLiNeBrEaKAutomakers' competencyLiNeBrEaKShouldn't George Will wait until the U.S. automakers are at least getting some of their bailout money before he starts proclaiming how competent they are compared to government policy makers? ("A curious confidence in government competence," Dec. 29)LiNeBrEaKFrom my casual awareness, there have been waiting periods of three to four months over the past few years to buy hybrid cars.LiNeBrEaKThere was apparently much greater (short-term) profitability in making SUVs, however.LiNeBrEaKBILL KOWNACKILiNeBrEaKNorth PortlandLiNeBrEaKAnnihilation, not aidLiNeBrEaKDear Hamas: When you call for the annihilation of a nation, expect retaliation.LiNeBrEaKDear World: When someone calls for, works for and prays for the annihilation of a nation, the proportionate response is to annihilate them (not give them humanitarian aid).LiNeBrEaKLINDA COHNLiNeBrEaKSoutheast PortlandLiNeBrEaKEnd-of-year wishLiNeBrEaKBefore the year is over, I want to read the following: Good news, stock market is going strong, medical care available for all, economy is strong, our new president-elect is not referred to by his race, home sales are booming and mortgage rates are low. There is peace in the world.LiNeBrEaKI would also love to read that no one is hungry or homeless, all the charities are being given to at a generous rate, animals are being treated with kindness and love, children are happy and enjoying learning like never before. All people are respectful of each other and lend a helping hand to their neighbors.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday   Sunrise Edition	Build the Palomar natural gas pipeline  	Editorial; Pg. C04  	504 words  	SUMMARY: The project is essential for ensuring gas supply reliabilityLiNeBrEaKfor NW Natural's 655,000 customers in the NorthwestLiNeBrEaKBuild the PalomarLiNeBrEaKnatural gas pipelineLiNeBrEaKE nvironmentalists, property owners and their allies in political office have a slew of objections to the proposed Palomar natural gas pipeline. LiNeBrEaKNone of those objections, however, outweighs public benefits of the ambitious project.LiNeBrEaKThe 217-mile pipeline would stretch from the lower Columbia River to an interstate gas hub in central Oregon. Portland-based Northwest Natural Gas Co., seeking approval for Palomar in a joint venture with TransCanada Corp., makes a convincing case that the project would enhance service reliability to NW Natural's 655,000 customers and help ease future price volatility.LiNeBrEaKThat's no small matter, given that it was natural gas that kept more than a million people warm in Oregon and Washington during December's big storm. Before a million more people settle in the region, utilities must make sure the infrastructure is ready to serve them.LiNeBrEaKPalomar's critics remain unfazed by such reasoning. They voice concern that the pipeline's lower Columbia River terminus might serve a liquefied natural gas terminal, another highly controversial proposal. Among the objections: Backers of the LNG project haven't proved that all that imported liquefied gas would be needed in Oregon.LiNeBrEaKThat's a debatable assertion, but there's an easy response to it: So what? Throughout this month's ice storm, none of the natural gas that kept thousands of Oregon-Washington homes and businesses warm came from here. It came via pipeline across state lines, mostly from the Rockies and Canada.LiNeBrEaKA self-serving approach to pipelines, limited to projects benefiting only the states where they're built, would be poor public policy indeed. It would have meant not a single home heated by natural gas in chilly Portland last week.LiNeBrEaKCritics have other objections, of course, including Palomar's environmental impact. But federal law provides ample safeguards on that score, and NW Natural has a good record of building and operating more than 14,000 miles of pipelines with care for the environment.LiNeBrEaKPalomar critics also argue that natural gas and LNG development runs counter to global warming initiatives. To the contrary, clean-burning natural gas is essential in helping nations make the difficult transition from the coal and oil era to clean, renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKIt's true that the pipeline would cut through many miles of valuable farm, vineyard and timber lands. That's an unavoidable downside that would have to be mitigated through fair compensation to landowners and adherence to the highest safety standards.LiNeBrEaKThere's irony in this controversy. At a time when the federal government seeks to stimulate the economy by spending hundreds of billions of dollars on big public works projects, Palomar would be privately funded to the tune of $800 billion.LiNeBrEaKThat would put a lot of people to work. And though it's not the main reason the pipeline should be built, it's a good one.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday   Sunrise Edition	Faith in state water supplies runs dry  	Local News  	583 words  	SUMMARY: Oregon surveys   | A forecast says climate change could drive up demand in the years to comeLiNeBrEaKSurvey shows Oregonians worry about water supply Climate change could drive water demand higher Faith in LiNeBrEaKstate waterLiNeBrEaKsuppliesLiNeBrEaKruns dry Recycling,LiNeBrEaKconservationLiNeBrEaKmentionedLiNeBrEaKMICHAEL MILSTEINLiNeBrEaKOregon may be known for the rain that feeds its rivers, but Oregonians are pessimistic there will be enough water to go around as the state's population grows and climate change possibly makes summers even drier.LiNeBrEaKThat was the take-home message from five "Water Roundtables" held throughout the state in September and October as an initial step toward developing a strategy for how the state will meet rising demand on its limited water supplies. Two-thirds of those surveyed at the roundtables --held in cities from the rain-drenched coast to the high eastern deserts --do not think that Oregon in 2028 will have enough water to cover all its needs, including the needs of wildlife.LiNeBrEaKOregon State University's Institute for Water and Watersheds, which helped coordinate the roundtables, has released a report on the meetings and surveys of those attending.LiNeBrEaKOregon is one of only two Western states --Alaska is the other --without a water-supply plan outlining how it will meet future water demands. Oregonians may have assumed water wasn't a limiting factor, but that's likely to change, said Brenda Ortigoza Bateman, senior policy coordinator at the Water Resources Department, who attended all the roundtables.LiNeBrEaKThe results of the roundtables dovetail with a forecast developed by the Oregon Water Resources Department showing that water needs are expected to grow more than 10 percent by 2050, even as supplies may shrink in a warmer climate. Agriculture, industry, cities and residences all will need more water.LiNeBrEaK"With the population growth we're expecting and the changes coming with climate change, we've got to put some serious thought into how we're going to address water demands," Bateman said. "Anyone in eastern Oregon and anybody who's around in the summer knows water is not always available."LiNeBrEaKThe meetings were held in Salem, Bend, Newport, Ontario and Medford and were open to the public. They were designed for officials to learn more about the water issues that concern Oregonians. Among those that emerged:LiNeBrEaK* Funding needs for water supply and wastewater facilities.LiNeBrEaK* Impact of climate change on water supplies.LiNeBrEaK* Protection of existing water rights.LiNeBrEaK* Water quality, especially urban runoff.LiNeBrEaK* Restoring ecologically important wetlands and floodplains.LiNeBrEaK"Many people are ready and willing to tackle some of the difficult water issues we're facing and work together even though there are some contentious disagreements," said Michael Campana, director of the water institute at OSU.LiNeBrEaKHe said Oregonians clearly want solutions to water issues to come from the local level, rather than through a state or federally ordained system. Potential solutions mentioned at the meetings included reusing and recycling water, building more storage, conserving water and giving tax credits for water conservation --similar to existing energy tax credits.LiNeBrEaKThe state water demand forecast says climate change could drive the demand for water higher as summers become drier. It suggested that aggressive water conservation could reduce the state's water demands but would require large investments and a shift in public attitudes to give conservation a higher priority.LiNeBrEaKMichael Milstein: 503-294-7689; michaelmilstein@LiNeBrEaKnews.oregonian.com	CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); POLLS and SURVEYS (90%); RURAL DEVELOPMENT (89%); WATER QUALITY (89%); COASTAL AREAS (78%); AQUIFERS and WATERSHEDS (78%); WETLANDS (77%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (73%); POPULATION GROWTH (73%); FLOOD ZONES (71%); WATER RIGHTS (71%); SEWERAGE SYSTEMS (64%); POPULATION and DEMOGRAPHICS (56%); POPULATION SIZE (56%)  		SALEM, OR, USA (79%) OREGON, USA (96%); WEST USA (79%) UNITED STATES (96%)  	January 1, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  	MICHAEL MILSTEIN, The Oregonian  	OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY (55%)  																				
Pioneer Press (St. Paul, Minnesota)  	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	Pool drain regulations among new Minnesota laws: Several go into effect Thursday  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	470 words  	Dec. 31--A faulty swimming pool drain cost 6-year-old Abigail Taylor her life.LiNeBrEaKThe Edina girl was swimming in a kiddie pool at the Minneapolis Golf Club on June 29, 2007, when she got lodged in an open pool drain. The suction resulted in severe internal injuries. She died nine months later. LiNeBrEaKHer death prompted lawmakers to demand safety improvements at Minnesota swimming pools.LiNeBrEaKThe Abigail Taylor Pool Safety Act is one of several state laws to take effect Thursday. It is aimed to protect children and others from the same fate. Other 2009 laws are intended to protect the environment from greenhouse gases and drivers on the road from big rigs.LiNeBrEaKA glimpse of Minnesota's new laws:LiNeBrEaKPool safety: Lawmakers enacted a law for pool drains after Abigail died of injuries caused by a faulty pool drain. Starting Thursday, pools 4 feet deep or less must have anti-entrapment drain covers and other systems to make sure swimmers cannot become trapped by the drain. Also, a certified state-registered engineer must review public pool construction plans. A separate federal law with similar safety enhancements went into effect Dec. 19.LiNeBrEaKTruck safety: A law aims to make drivers more aware of how to share the road with trucks. Under the regulations, driver's education and commercial driver's training will include information on the proper distance for following trucks, the distance needed for trucks to stop, truck blind spots and how to avoid driving in the blindLiNeBrEaKspot.LiNeBrEaKLeaky air conditioners: A law will require automakers to disclose how much air conditioner refrigerant leaks from various makes and models of vehicles. Air conditioner refrigerant is a greenhouse gas, which could contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKAviation insurance claims: A 2003 plane crash in northern Minnesota resulted in a new aviation liability insurance law. Under the law, insurance companies can deny a claim if a pilot's action or inaction has a direct effect on the loss.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday   All Editions	Speak no more of mavericks and green;  Words and phrases we wore out in '08 	NEWS; Pg. A09  	589 words  	DETROIT ? A movie about a "maverick," his journey "from Wall Street to Main Street," his "desperate search" for a "monkey" and a "game-changing" revelation about his "carbon footprint" probably would make the nation's word-watchers physically ill.LiNeBrEaKEspecially if it were the "winner of five nominations." LiNeBrEaKAll those words and phrases are on Lake Superior State University's annual List of Words to Be Banished from the Queen's English for Mis-use, Over-use and General Uselessness. The 34th version of the list was released Tuesday, which means, "It's that time of year again."LiNeBrEaKThe school in Michigan's Upper Peninsula selected 15 entries from about 5,000 nominations.LiNeBrEaKDespite the year's economic meltdown (which itself wasn't banished but don't rule it out for next year), the most entries came from the environmental category ? for "green" or "going green."LiNeBrEaK"If I see one more corporation declare itself 'green,' I'm going to start burning tires in my backyard," wrote Ed Hardiman of Bristow, Va., in his submission.LiNeBrEaKNominators also had their fill of "carbon footprint" ? the amount of greenhouse gases an individual's lifestyle produces.LiNeBrEaKThe list wasn't overrun with politics despite the national election ? no "change," for instance ? but one simply couldn't escape the critics' wrath.LiNeBrEaK"I'm a maverick, he's a maverick, wouldn't you like to be a maverick, too?" offered Michael Burke of Silver Spring, Md., in his entry for the label embraced by unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate John McCain.LiNeBrEaKAlso knocked was "first dude," a term adopted by Todd Palin, husband of McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.LiNeBrEaKWords related to the economy led to a few meltdowns.LiNeBrEaK"I am so tired of hearing about everything affecting 'Main Street.' I know that with the 'Wall Street' collapse, the comparison is convenient, but really, let's find another way to talk about everyman or the middle class, or even, heaven forbid, 'Joe the Plumber.' " wrote Stacey from Knoxville, Tenn. She provided only a first name in her bid to eradicate ? or at least separate ? "Wall Street" and "Main Street."LiNeBrEaKAlthough this year's sluggish economy and record rise in gas prices may have kept people closer to home, the word coined for it, "staycation," is "idiotic and rootless," says Michele Mooney of Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaKAn emoticon made the list for the first time. The strings of characters used in e-mails and text-messaging commonly represent a face ? like ;-) or :-0 ? but the school singled out an emoticon heart, formed with a "less than" symbol and the number 3.LiNeBrEaK"Monkey" was on the list because of what some see as its rampant use as a suffix.LiNeBrEaK"Especially on the Internet, many people seem to think they can make any boring name sound more attractive just by adding the word 'monkey' to it," wrote Rogier Landman of Sommerville, Mass.LiNeBrEaKThe school's annual quest to throw lexicon logs on the fire always gets some end-of-the-year attention for the school in Sault Ste. Marie, the last stop before Michigan's northern border crossing with Canada. But the list is more about letting off steam and offering laughs than performing any verbal vanishing act.LiNeBrEaK"We get several nominations for the same word or phrase, and we still get nominations for words and phrases that have been on previous years' lists," said university spokesman Tom Pink.LiNeBrEaK" 'At this point in time' was on the first list in 1976, and it continues to be nominated every year. People still hate it."LiNeBrEaKThink these gendarmes of jargon should "get a life"? Watch it, kiddo. That phrase was banished in 1997.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday   All Editions	Want green jobs throughout nation? Watch California  	OPINION; Pg. A14  	773 words  	THE LAST TIME the federal government tried to play a large role in stimulating the development of renewable-energy projects, it failed miserably. Instead, states such as California were the ones that ended up jump-starting today's wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass industries.LiNeBrEaKAs President-elect Barack Obama and Congress craft a federal stimulus program package designed to add 2. 5 million jobs, many of them green, across the country, they should remember some important lessons from the past. LiNeBrEaKFederal investments in wind power after the energy crisis of 1973 failed to produce a single commercial wind turbine. It took the political leadership of people such as California Gov. Jerry Brown to put in place state incentives to grow the wind industry from the ground up, instead of from the top down.LiNeBrEaKNow that Obama has picked his new energy and environment Cabinet appointments, there is hope among many that the United States can move forward with a clean power agenda. Given the lack of leadership from the White House over the past eight years, it is refreshing for renewable-energy advocates to hear that Obama doesn't buy the argument that what's good for the environment is bad for the economy.LiNeBrEaKBut along the way, Obama must not lose track of the fact that big is not always better. Innovation is an imprecise process, and all levels of government need to play critical roles.LiNeBrEaKIf the United States is to make the most of taxpayer investments in a new green-jobs program, Obama would be smart to look West first before launching a national green jobs program. California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada and Arizona have already done their homework on the best ways to develop some of the world's best renewable-resource basins. And they are poised to make significant strides in following through on that work.LiNeBrEaKStarting pointLiNeBrEaKBecause the West is uniquely blessed with diverse renewable resources, it makes sense to start here. The most important state for Obama is California, which already has in place the most aggressive state goals to combat global climate change and has been a magnet for venture capital in new emerging renewable-energy technologies.LiNeBrEaKWith some of the world's best sites for solar, geothermal, wind and biomass resources, California can serve as the testing ground for large-scale deployment of diverse renewable-energy sources, showing other parts of the country how best to balance economic and environmental considerations. By addressing thorny permit issues on federal land in southern California, the state, working with federal wildlife and defense agencies, can help Obama think through how to best transition to a renewable-energy economy. Just like other infrastructure projects, these facilities often get tied up in security concerns on military bases, and get snagged on issues of endangered species and habitat protection.LiNeBrEaKStreamlining bureaucracyLiNeBrEaKObama can ensure that new renewable energy projects get built, by setting clear direction through his Council on Environmental Quality and by streamlining approvals among federal agencies for transmission lines. These transmission lines are the missing link. They bring clean energy from remote deserts and mountain regions to urban centers that need electricity, and without them, the United States will simply not be capable of adding the green jobs Obama has promised.LiNeBrEaKAnother critical role for the federal government is to demonstrate real government support for all renewable-technologies programs. To its credit, Congress did recently authorize a federal tax credit for users of solar technlogies over the next eight years, but only secured a one-year extension of a tax incentive for wind. The prime reason Europe and Japan now dominate wind and solar is that their governments offered consistent support. Instead of its current waffling, the United States must follow suit.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia and the rest of the West provide the best near-term opportunity for Obama to create thousands of new green jobs. Since renewable-energy sources enjoy a 4-1 jobs advantage over equivalent investments in fossil fuels, there is no time to lose.LiNeBrEaKRather than prescriptive programs forced upon state and local governments (or throwing dollars around without a clear strategic objective), Obama would be wise to offer steady support for the West Coast innovators already trying to make progress on the ground by building solar, wind and geothermal projects today.LiNeBrEaKPeter Asmus has recently completed a green-jobs report for the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, which can be found at www.cleanpower.org.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	Ron Roberts  	OPINION; Pg. B-7  	550 words  	San Diego County Supervisor Ron Roberts, a member of the California Air Resources Board, talks about the board's work to combat global warming by implementing AB 32, a state law adopted in 2006, and about the law's possible effects. LiNeBrEaKGov. Schwarznegger and others pushed for AB 32 because they hoped it would inspire the rest of the world to act more aggressively in dealing with global warming. Do you think that's happened?LiNeBrEaKFor the past 50 years, California has been a world leader in controlling toxic air emissions and reducing pollution. The board has received worldwide attention because its programs have been measurably effective and reproducible elsewhere. While the recent adoption of the Scoping Plan by the California Air Resources Board is a significant first step, much remains to be done before these efforts can be seen by others as a successful program. It would be premature to claim any notable world impact. While many hope this will be the case, the numerous decisions that will be made over the next few years will determine whether California achieves that goal.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps the most disputed aspect of the AB 32 Scoping Plan was its claims that the new rules would have a substantial long-term economic benefit. How confident are you this will prove to be the case?LiNeBrEaKIn the big picture, if these efforts contribute to significant greenhouse gas reductions and a reversal of the effects of climate change, then we will have beneficial economic benefits. Regarding the claims that economic gains based on technological breakthroughs would exceed the regulatory cost of these efforts, the staff was on very weak ground. While past programs related to toxic emissions have resulted in significant economic development for California, I think the projections made for AB 32 were unsupportedly optimistic.LiNeBrEaKThe economists who peer-reviewed the Scoping Plan offered scathing criticism of its methodology, including a Harvard professor who is one of the world's leading experts on economics and the environment. Did that give you pause?LiNeBrEaKThere were several reports that gave me pause, including the state Legislative Analyst Office's report that disputed the rosy picture that our staff painted. It was clear that the staff was in retreat on this issue. However, as I mentioned above, the decisions that have yet to be made will determine the economic costs and consequences. The implementation of the Scoping Plan and its impact on the various economic sectors will have to be carefully considered as we move forward. I would hope that all of the board members would demand the best economic analysis possible. Past board successes have been achieved because of accurate economic analysis. Net economic gain does not automatically happen.LiNeBrEaKManufacturers are particularly worried about AB 32's effects. How do you think they will fare?LiNeBrEaKManufacturers, along with anyone involved in energy, transportation, construction, local government and a myriad of others, need to pay particular attention to the development of the specific implementation plans over the next few years. If the air board works closely with each of these sectors and develops fair and effective rules based on science and economic understanding, we will all benefit, and California will have earned its reputation as a world leader.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	A peculiar choice;  If Obama wants farm reform, why Vilsack? 	OPINION ; Pg. B-6  	409 words  	For two decades, the wealthy agricultural interests who have made billions of dollars off federal subsidies for ethanol production have had crucial support from the environmental movement. Green groups liked the idea of using corn-based ethanol as an alternative to heavily polluting fossil fuels. LiNeBrEaKNow -- with evidence piling up that ethanol likely hurts the environment because its production is so energy- and water-intensive -- this protective cover is evaporating. Last week, six green organizations -- including the influential Environmental Working Group -- denounced corn-based ethanol for producing "unintended, yet potentially catastrophic environmental consequences" with "little or no ... protection from global warming."LiNeBrEaKThe group neglected to mention the unintended consequence that is of far greater concern to the typical household: The surge in the cost of many extremely common and popular processed foods because of the demand-driven increase in corn's price. What is driving that demand? Federal subsidies for ethanol production.LiNeBrEaKGiven this picture, what Congress did in May remains difficult to fathom: It overrode by wide margins President Bush's veto of a bloated five-year farm bill that increased ethanol subsidies and mandated greater use of biofuels.LiNeBrEaKNow there is another head-scratcher for proponents of a rational farm policy: President-elect Barack Obama has chosen former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack to be his agriculture secretary.LiNeBrEaKIowa has reaped the biggest chunk of the $25 billion-plus lavished on ethanol subsidies since the late 1980s, and Vilsack has been a belligerent supporter of even-greater subsidies. His selection is difficult to square with Obama's recent call to cap subsidies given to wealthy farmers and with his criticism of the excessive power wielded in Washington by "big agribusiness."LiNeBrEaKOn the other hand, the president-elect's own history is difficult to square with his recent farm-reform talk. Obama ardently backed ethanol subsidies while in the Senate -- his home state of Illinois trails only Iowa in corn production -- and one of his closest confidants, former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, is as responsible as any politician for the explosion in these subsidies.LiNeBrEaKSo while we hope Obama's call for reform is sincere, it's tough to be optimistic. Even as the case against ethanol subsidies grows more overwhelming, they appear more entrenched than ever. U.S. farm policy has never seemed more irrational.

Santa Cruz Sentinel (California)  	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	Pajaro Valley water mystery could solve statewide question  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	554 words  	Dec. 31--Every winter millions of gallons of water are pumped from Harkins Slough to a pond off San Andreas Road. There, by design, the water percolates into a natural clay-lined storage basin so it can be tapped later for irrigation. LiNeBrEaKBut so far only a fraction has been recovered. Where the rest of the water from the Pajaro Valley Water Management Agency's Harkins Slough Recharge Project goes is a mystery, one researchers from UC Santa Cruz, Stanford and the University of Alaska are trying to solve.LiNeBrEaKThe answer could lead to a desperately needed increase in local water supplies, but it has implications far beyond the Pajaro Valley. That's why researchers have been able to tap into more than $1 million in grants to study the system.LiNeBrEaKTuesday, researchers deployed a new tool, an osmotic sampler, in an effort to trace the flow of underground water.LiNeBrEaK"This pond is not going to solve Pajaro Valley's groundwater problem, but it's a piece of the puzzle," said UC Santa Cruz earth sciences professor Andy Fisher.LiNeBrEaKThe Pajaro Valley pumps more groundwater than can be replenished by winter rains. As the groundwater drops, salt water has moved inland, contaminating coastal wells.LiNeBrEaKBrian Lockwood, the water agency's hydrologist, said the recharge project could play a significant role in meeting coastal irrigation needs if researchers figure out how to make the project work more efficiently.LiNeBrEaKFisher said similar ponds could provide small-scale local solutionsLiNeBrEaKto a statewide water shortage, especially if, as predicted, global warming results in a smaller snow pack and more severe winter storms. California will need more places to store water, he said, and natural underground basins provide more capacity than reservoirs.LiNeBrEaKBut questions abound. At the Harkins Slough project, for instance, close to 4,500 acre feet of water has been pumped from slough to pond since December 2001, but only 1,000 acre feet has been recovered through nearby wells.LiNeBrEaKAn acre foot of water is 325,000 gallons.LiNeBrEaKThe osmotic sampler, dropped more than 200 feet into a monitoring well, will continuously sample water during the next six months to provide clues as to how the water moves from the clay-lined recharge basin to the deeper aquifer below.LiNeBrEaKWater quality is another question, and researchers are looking for a way to reduce nitrates, which can be hazardous to human health, in groundwater. They dug two trenches in the bottom of the pond, filling one with gravel and the other with untreated redwood mulch. Lockwood said researchers want to see if microbes in the mulch will "eat" nitrates.LiNeBrEaKLockwood recently wrote his first grant to aid the research, a $227,000 request for state aid that would allow the agency to drill three more monitoring wells. The Department of Water Resources has approved his application, and the money could start flowing in March.LiNeBrEaKContact Donna Jones at 763-4505 or djones@santacruzsentinel.com	IRRIGATION (90%); WATER QUALITY (90%); WATER and WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT (89%); WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (89%); WATER SUPPLY UTILITIES (89%); RESEARCH (89%); AQUIFERS and WATERSHEDS (78%); CLIMATOLOGY (76%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (76%); GRANTS and GIFTS (74%); SCIENCE FUNDING (74%); APPROVALS (71%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (70%); GLOBAL WARMING (70%)  		CALIFORNIA, USA (91%) UNITED STATES (91%)  	December 31, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008    	Donna Jones, Santa Cruz Sentinel, Calif.

San Jose Mercury News (California)  	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	Top 10 stories of 2008  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	795 words  	Dec. 31--The credit crash, "Yes We Can" and Olympic opulence: 2008 will go down in history as a memorable year, even if the worst economic downturn since the 1930s made many Americans want to forget it. Here are the main stories of the year that captured the attention of California and the United States:LiNeBrEaKObama wins White House LiNeBrEaKLargely unknown two years ago, the self-described "skinny kid with a funny name" took down the Clinton dynasty and then war hero John McCain. With RFK-like oratory and steel-trap discipline, Barack Obama became the first African-American to win the White House, carrying California by 25 percentage points -- the largest margin since FDR in 1936. Now comes the hard part.LiNeBrEaKEconomy melts downLiNeBrEaKThe Dow cratered by 34 percent in 2008, the worst plunge since 1931. Credit dried up. Unemployment jumped. And Bay Area home prices fell 48 percent from a year ago. In Silicon Valley, IPOs stalled and layoffs hammered Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, Yahoo and other giants. Locally, job losses aren't as bad as the 2000 bubble, but economists expect more pain through at least mid-2009.LiNeBrEaKOil prices soar, then collapseLiNeBrEaKDriven by huge new demand from China and India, oil prices peaked at a $147 a barrel in July, sending California gas prices to $4. 61 a gallon.LiNeBrEaKBut demand dried up with the economy, and oil is $39 this week; gasoline $1. 80. Environmentalists worry Hummers will make a comeback even as California has just approved tough new global warming rules. But low gas prices amount to a huge tax break for beleaguered consumers.LiNeBrEaKIraq winds downLiNeBrEaKBy the end of 2008, nearly all of America's allies had pulled their troops and news organizations were pulling their reporters. Polls showed the public wanted out, too. The surge offered promise, reducing violence. Obama promised withdrawal in 16 months. But the more than 4,200 Americans killed since the conflict began -- the most combat dead since Vietnam -- gave the ultimate sacrifice.LiNeBrEaKBeijing OlympicsLiNeBrEaKAquaman Michael Phelps won more gold than anyone in history. Usain Bolt blistered the track. The smog cleared. And despite continuing human rights abuses, China amazed the world with a spectacular opening ceremony and fiasco-free games that firmly established it as a 21st century powerhouse.LiNeBrEaKChinese earthquake kills 70,000LiNeBrEaKApart from the Olympics, it was a bad year for China. Tainted Chinese food and toys caused public health scandals. An uprising in Tibet made world headlines. And in May, an earthquake killed 70,000 people in Sichuan province and left 5 million homeless, exposing the country's poor building standards for schools and homes.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia budget woesLiNeBrEaKArnold Schwarzenegger promised to "blow up the boxes" when he was elected governor in 2003. But the only thing blown up in 2008 were state finances. The recession tanked tax receipts, setting up a $40 billion deficit and the possibility California will run out of cash by February. &iuml;&raquo;&iquest;Democrats resisted cuts, Republicans refused to raise taxes and Schwarzenegger, who oversaw a 45 percent increase in state spending in five years, looked powerless to fix it.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia voters reject gay marriageLiNeBrEaKThe most expensive, emotionally charged issue of the California election, Proposition 8 eliminated the right of same-sex couples to marry. It was defeated widely in the Bay Area, but passed 52-48 statewide on the strength of yes votes from white evangelicals, blacks and Latinos. Gay couples, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Santa Clara County will spend 2009 before the state Supreme Court trying to overturn it.LiNeBrEaKMumbai terrorism rocks IndiaLiNeBrEaKOn Nov. 26, Islamic terrorists rampaged through Mumbai, the financial capital of India, killing nearly 171 people and taking hostages in numerous places, including the landmark Taj Mahal Hotel. The attackers, who had links to Pakistan, renewed long-standing animosities between India and Pakistan.LiNeBrEaKNancy Pelosi elected House speakerLiNeBrEaKOn Jan. 3, 2008, something happened that had never occurred in the 219-year history of the House of Representatives: Lawmakers addressed their leader as "Madam Speaker." San Francisco's Nancy Pelosi, the daughter of a Baltimore mayor and mother of five, defeated Republican John Boehner for the top House post, turning the lower chamber in a more liberal direction and becoming the highest-ranking woman in the history of U.S. government.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL Edition	State joins groups suing feds on new species act rules;  SAN FRANCISCO;  Bush policy eases review of a project's potential harm	Metro; Pg. B1  	687 words  	State Attorney General Jerry Brown is challenging the Bush administration's attempt to narrow scientific review of development that might hurt endangered species, joining environmental groups that have sued in San Francisco over the government's hotly disputed regulatory changes.LiNeBrEaK"The Bush administration is seeking to gut the Endangered Species Act on its way out the door," Brown said in a statement Tuesday after filing suit a day earlier in U.S. District Court. LiNeBrEaKMajor environmental organizations went to court two weeks ago to contest the regulations, which took effect Dec. 16. Although the suits claim the regulations violate the Endangered Species Act and other environmental laws, none of the plaintiffs has asked for an order halting enforcement of the new rules before President-elect Barack Obama takes office Jan. 20.LiNeBrEaK"We'd like to give the new administration a chance to respond," said Noah Greenwald of the Center for Biological Diversity, which filed the first suit. He said the Obama administration, after taking over defense of the suit, could agree to suspend the regulations while it works on new rules.LiNeBrEaKThe regulations apply to federal agencies that approve projects on land owned or regulated by the federal government - for example, logging or mining in national forests or underwater drilling or dredging. LiNeBrEaKIn the past, agencies have been required to consult with scientists from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service about whether a project might affect an endangered species or its habitat, and, if so, what protective measures are needed. LiNeBrEaKThe new regulations allow an agency to decide whether effects on an endangered species are too trivial to require that government scientists be consulted. LiNeBrEaKThe rules give a scientific agency 60 days to object to being bypassed. Environmental groups say it is virtually impossible for an agency to respond that quickly because of a huge volume of cases.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration's regulations also declare that global warming is not covered by the Endangered Species Act, and that federal agencies have no duty to consider the possible effect of development on climate change before deciding whether a project threatens a species. LiNeBrEaKThat provision followed Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne's announcement May 14 that he was listing the polar bear as a threatened species because of its dwindling sea ice habitat, but that the listing would not lead to restrictions on emissions of greenhouse gases from any specific source such as power plants, cars or oil drilling in Arctic waters.LiNeBrEaKAsked Tuesday about the new regulations, Interior Department spokeswoman Tina Kreisher cited Kempthorne's comments.LiNeBrEaK"The secretary said the Endangered Species Act was never intended to be a way to address global climate change," she said, because the law focuses on the effects of individual development projects on species and their habitat.LiNeBrEaKOverall, she said, the Bush administration's new regulations allow federal agencies to "do more to protect species." That's because the rules require consultation with government scientists only on projects that could cause significant harm, she said. LiNeBrEaKBut Brown and environmental groups say the changes strike at the heart of the law.LiNeBrEaK"It's a classic case of the fox guarding the henhouse," Greenwald said, because the same agency that has been promoting a project will decide whether it needs to consult with scientists.LiNeBrEaKBrown called the new regulations "an audacious attempt to circumvent a time-tested statute that for 35 years has required scientific review of federal agency decisions that affect wildlife."LiNeBrEaKHis lawsuit drew criticism from the Pacific Legal Foundation, a property-rights group that often represents developers. Its president, Rob Rivett, said the Bush administration regulations allow federal agencies to rely on in-house experts to conduct their own environmental assessments "without redundant bureaucratic reviews."LiNeBrEaKThe attorney general's "showboating threatens to stall America's economic recovery," Rivett said, "because we need the regulatory streamlining that Brown is opposing."

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	Elkhorn Slough acquisitions will help combat global warming  	BREAKING; Communities; Central Coast; Science; News; Local; Science and Tech  	499 words  	The need to protect coastal marshes, where great seabirds journey and tiny shellfish scurry, has focused largely on saving wildlife.LiNeBrEaKThis month's expansion of Elkhorn Slough, however, highlights another reason to care for the wetlands: global warming. LiNeBrEaKThree properties added in recent weeks to the federally and state-managed preserve mean more land to soak up water, a key to preventing flooding and lessening the effects of sea-level rise as the Earth's climate warms, environmentalists say.LiNeBrEaK"The wetlands are not just for wildlife habitat, but serve the fundamental needs of humans," said Mark Silberstein, executive director of the Elkhorn Slough Foundation.LiNeBrEaKThe new properties, while expanding the 7,000-acre preserve by just 38 acres, serve as vital links to "connecting drainage bottoms," Silberstein said, which allows more water to percolate through the marshlands. In addition to nourishing plants and animals as well as the water supply, this means providing a buffer to warming.LiNeBrEaK"It's becoming painfully clear that we have to take care of these things," Silberstein said.LiNeBrEaKThe prospect of climate change has environmentalists pushing to restore and expand wetlands across the nation, perhaps most aggressively in low-lying parts of the Southeast most susceptible to flooding, but in California as well.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to moderating tides and absorbing runoff, wetlands have the ability to capture carbon in the atmosphere, said David Lewis, executive director of San Francisco's Save the Bay, which is working to restore the sloughs of the Golden Gate.LiNeBrEaKEvery acre of the slough's fast-growing vegetation soaks up 870 kilograms of greenhouse gas annually, roughly equal to the emissions of driving 2,280 miles, according to Lewis.LiNeBrEaK"There's been a lot of talk about replanting forests, but tidal marshes are good, too," he said.LiNeBrEaKAt Elkhorn Slough, second only to the San Francisco Bay in its expanse of tidal marshland in California, Silberstein said there's no shortage of reasons to expand the wetlands.LiNeBrEaKThe region harbors a diversity of wildlife   340 types of birds and 100 fish species   as well as the groundwater supplies of nearby communities, both of which have been threatened by development.LiNeBrEaKThis month's most visible acquisition is 24. 5 acres at the intersection of Highway 1 and Struve Road. The land was obtained by the state Wildlife Conservation Board for $135,000.LiNeBrEaKElsewhere, 11 acres off Dolan Road were obtained by the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve for $465,000, and a 2. 5-acre conservation easement along Castroville Boulevard was transferred, at no cost, to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation.LiNeBrEaKNone of the new properties in the jointly run preserve are developed.LiNeBrEaKThe parcels join more than 2,500 acres of slough that have been brought under protection during the past seven years.LiNeBrEaKSilberstein said the effort will continue.LiNeBrEaK"The longer we wait, the more it costs and the less there is," he said.LiNeBrEaKContact Kurtis Alexander at 706-3267 or kalexander@santacruzsentinel.com	WETLANDS (91%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); COASTAL AREAS (89%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (89%); ECOSYSTEMS and HABITATS (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); WILDLIFE (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); LAND USE PLANNING (77%); WATER QUALITY (77%); EASEMENTS and RIGHTS OF WAY (72%); REFORESTATION (62%)  		SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA (92%); SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (93%); EARTH (79%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 1, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 San Jose Mercury News All Rights Reserved  	By Kurtis Alexander Santa Cruz Sentinel  																					
San Jose Mercury News (California) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	Top 10 stories of 2008  	POLITICS; Special Reports; Communities; San Jose - Valley; Special Reports; News; National; State; World; Local; Business  	748 words  	The credit crash, "Yes We Can" and Olympic opulence: 2008 will go down in history as a memorable year, even if the worst economic downturn since the 1930s made many Americans want to forget it. Here are the main stories of the year that captured the attention of California and the United States:LiNeBrEaKObama wins White House LiNeBrEaKLargely unknown two years ago, the self-described "skinny kid with a funny name" took down the Clinton dynasty and then war hero John McCain. With RFK-like oratory and steel-trap discipline, Barack Obama became the first African-American to win the White House, carrying California by 25 percentage points   the largest margin since FDR in 1936. Now comes the hard part.LiNeBrEaKEconomy melts downLiNeBrEaKThe Dow cratered by 34 percent in 2008, the worst plunge since 1931. Credit dried up. Unemployment jumped. And Bay Area home prices fell 48 percent from a year ago. In Silicon Valley, IPOs stalled and layoffs hammered Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, Yahoo and other giants. Locally, job losses aren't as bad as the 2000 bubble, but economists expect more pain through at least mid-2009.LiNeBrEaKOil prices soar, then collapseLiNeBrEaKDriven by huge new demand from China and India, oil prices peaked at a $147 a barrel in July, sending California gas prices to $4. 61 a gallon. But demand dried up with the economy, and oil is $39 this week; gasoline $1. 80. Environmentalists worry Hummers will make a comeback even as California has just approved tough new global warming rules. But low gas prices amount to a huge tax break for beleaguered consumers.LiNeBrEaKIraq winds downLiNeBrEaKBy the end of 2008, nearly all of America's allies had pulled their troops and news organizations were pulling their reporters. Polls showed the public wanted out, too. The surge offered promise, reducing violence. Obama promised withdrawal in 16 months. But the more than 4,200 Americans killed since the conflict began   the most combat dead since Vietnam   gave the ultimate sacrifice.LiNeBrEaKBeijing OlympicsLiNeBrEaKAquaman Michael Phelps won more gold than anyone in history. Usain Bolt blistered the track. The smog cleared. And despite continuing human rights abuses, China amazed the world with a spectacular opening ceremony and fiasco-free games that firmly established it as a 21st century powerhouse.LiNeBrEaKChinese earthquake kills 70,000LiNeBrEaKApart from the Olympics, it was a bad year for China. Tainted Chinese food and toys caused public health scandals. An uprising in Tibet made world headlines. And in May, an earthquake killed 70,000 people in Sichuan province and left 5 million homeless, exposing the country's poor building standards for schools and homes.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia budget woesLiNeBrEaKArnold Schwarzenegger promised to "blow up the boxes" when he was elected governor in 2003. But the only thing blown up in 2008 were state finances. The recession tanked tax receipts, setting up a $40 billion deficit and the possibility California will run out of cash by February.  Democrats resisted cuts, Republicans refused to raise taxes and Schwarzenegger, who oversaw a 45 percent increase in state spending in five years, looked powerless to fix it.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia voters reject gay marriageLiNeBrEaKThe most expensive, emotionally charged issue of the California election, Proposition 8 eliminated the right of same-sex couples to marry. It was defeated widely in the Bay Area, but passed 52-48 statewide on the strength of yes votes from white evangelicals, blacks and Latinos. Gay couples, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Santa Clara County will spend 2009 before the state Supreme Court trying to overturn it.LiNeBrEaKMumbai terrorism rocks IndiaLiNeBrEaKOn Nov. 26, Islamic terrorists rampaged through Mumbai, the financial capital of India, killing nearly 171 people and taking hostages in numerous places, including the landmark Taj Mahal Hotel. The attackers, who had links to Pakistan, renewed long-standing animosities between India and Pakistan.LiNeBrEaKNancy Pelosi's first term as House speakerLiNeBrEaKOn Jan. 3, 2007, something happened that had never occurred in the 219-year history of the House of Representatives: Lawmakers addressed their leader as "Madam Speaker." But despite the historic shift, Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Congress struggled in 2008 to make their mark. They raised the minimum wage, but didn't have the votes to end the Iraq War, address global warming, provide children's health insurance or overturn President Bush's limits on stem cell research. After gaining more than 20 Democratic seats and the White House in November, Pelosi is hoping for a better 2009.LiNeBrEaKA mother cries as she holds a photo of his daughter who was killed in an earthquake, as she stands in the ruins of the Fuxin No. 2 Primary School in Wufu, in China's southwest Sichuan province Thursday May 29, 2008. China's central govenment has promised to punish harshly anyone found responsible for poor constuction of schools, though it has also said that building codes in the stricken region did not require structure to be able to withstand a quake of the power of the magnitude 7. 9 earthquake on May 12.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	Opinion: Car makers should be forced to meet higher fuel standards  	NEWS; Opinion  	645 words  	My first memories of riding in a car were formed while buckled into the couch-size back seat of my mother's bright green 1973 Chevy Nova. This monster vehicle, a relic of the gas-guzzler heyday of the early 1970s, was powered by a V-8 that could lurch from 0 to 60 mph in the blink of an eye. More inconveniently, it earned a dismal fuel-economy rating of 15 miles a gallon.LiNeBrEaKMy parents soon realized that the poor gas mileage was too steep a price to pay for the luxury of a powerful engine, and we downgraded to a smaller car. We learned a simple lesson about the benefits of lower gas consumption, a lesson now compounded by the urgency of the climate crisis and the need for energy security. LiNeBrEaKTwo weeks ago, President George W. Bush announced a plan to provide $17. 4 billion to bail out two of the floundering Big Three automakers: Chrysler and the once-proud maker of our Chevy Nova, General Motors. The bailout package may seem like a reluctant handout from the White House, but in reality, the current administration has been allied with these corporations for years, teaming up with them to fight fuel economy and emissions standards.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, the White House is preparing to dole out a New Year's bonus to the Detroit automakers by releasing yet another round of inadequate corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards: 31. 6 miles per gallon by 2015. These CAFE standards are pathetic, disregarding both current technology that can achieve 35 to 45 mpg and the needs of the environment and the American consumer.LiNeBrEaKDetroit automakers have spent millions of dollars opposing improvements in fuel economy and emissions standards through relentless lobbying and litigation. They've spent even more conjuring, through extensive advertising campaigns, a strong yet ultimately temporary demand for their inefficient vehicles instead of investing in hybrid and electric technology. The Big Three have not just erred in their business model by pursuing these odious strategies; they have firmly established their culpability for global warming. Calling it anything less than that is an insult to those who rely on these companies for their paychecks and retirement, and future generations who have a right to enjoy a stable climate.LiNeBrEaKSince Chrysler and GM have ignored the call for energy independence and better environmental standards, any bailout plan should include safeguards to protect taxpayers, consumers, and the environment.LiNeBrEaKFirst California must be allowed to immediately enact its emissions standards for motor vehicles. Second, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration must be directed to revise the upcoming CAFE standards to encourage innovative technologies that improve fuel economy. Finally, any bailout must require automakers receiving funds to drop any lawsuits attempting to block higher emissions standards and submit to Congress plans for accelerating production of fuel-efficient models.LiNeBrEaKThese minimum conditions are critical, but now is also our moment to accomplish more. Instead of awarding billions to the uninspired automakers, the taxpayers should simply buy one of the failing Big Three. We can begin a new Apollo Project, not only for a fleet of low-carbon and clean vehicles, but also for the trains, buses and light-rail systems that must be the core of our future transportation system.LiNeBrEaKThe Chevy Nova, a former product of GM's Chevrolet division, was built during the last gasps of an earlier era of oversize-auto production. Let us use this bailout as an opportunity to call for the end of another. In the 1980s, my parents sold their Chevy for a smaller, efficient Japanese car. But given the option, I know we would have traded it in for a leaner, cleaner GM model.LiNeBrEaKFrancisca Santana of San Francisco is a climate associate with the Center for Biological Diversity"s Climate Law Institute.

South Florida Sun-Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale)  	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	St. Thomas High School student uses Web site to teach children about global warming  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	459 words  	Dec. 31--Kristen Strobel loves the Internet and working with children.LiNeBrEaKHer two interests led her to create a Web site designed to teach elementary school students about global warming and how they can help improve the environment. LiNeBrEaKStrobel launched www.ssskids.com in August, inspired by her work on a Web site she created for her father's solar services company: Sunshinesolarservices.com. The company Web site links to the one for kids.LiNeBrEaK"I'd like my Web site to be able to teach kids that they can make a difference, even if it's in the smallest way," Strobel said. The site explains global warming through graphics and information from other sites, studies and research.LiNeBrEaKStrobel, 17, a senior at St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale, has been spinning out Web sites since the seventh grade. She has 10 active sites, and runs five of them.LiNeBrEaKShe never took a class, but learned about online sites through tutorials and the Internet.LiNeBrEaK"We're very proud of her ability and the fact that she is self-taught," said her father, Ed Strobel.LiNeBrEaKBesides games, ssskids.com offers children suggestions on how to help the environment, and links to other environmentally oriented resources.LiNeBrEaKIt's a sound site, said Aaron Huertas, press secretary for the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C.LiNeBrEaK"The Web site gets the basic science right, and does so in an easy-to-understand way," Huertas said. "I thought the tips were all good ones, especially for kids."LiNeBrEaKKristen Strobel's Internet skills don't surprise Elena Moran, her former advanced-placement U.S. history teacher and yearbook journalism instructor.LiNeBrEaKMoran said Strobel often takes the initiative at school.LiNeBrEaK"When she has an idea, she jumps in, shares it with the class and makes things happen," Moran said.LiNeBrEaKStrobel is working on two new sites: one for a nonprofit organization called Kids Ecology Corps and another for Saint John the Baptist Catholic Church in Fort Lauderdale.LiNeBrEaK"She's definitely very goal-oriented," said her mother, Cristina Strobel. "Once she gets on something, she doesn't stop until she's done."LiNeBrEaKKristen Strobel isn't sure how many children have viewed her site, but she has discovered she enjoys using the Internet to teach.LiNeBrEaK"I believe that kids can really impact society in general, because what they learn now, and what they do now, will affect the future."

The strings of characters used in e-mails and text-messaging commonly represent a face - like ;-) or :-0 - but the school singled out an emoticon heart, formed with a "less than" symbol and the number 3.LiNeBrEaK"Monkey" was on the list because of what some see as its rampant use as a suffix. "Especially on the Internet, many people seem to think they can make any boring name sound more attractive just by adding the word 'monkey' to it," wrote Rogier Landman of Sommerville, Mass.LiNeBrEaKThe school's annual quest to throw lexicon logs on the fire always gets some end-of-the-year attention for the school in Sault Ste. Marie, the last stop before Michigan's northern border crossing with Canada. But the list is more about letting off steam and offering laughs than performing any verbal vanishing act.LiNeBrEaK"We get several nominations for the same word or phrase, and we still get nominations for words and phrases that have been on previous years' lists," said university spokesman Tom Pink.LiNeBrEaK" 'At this point in time' was on the first list in 1976 and it continues to be nominated every year. People still hate it."LiNeBrEaKThink these gendarmes of jargon should "get a life"? Watch it, kiddo. That phrase was banished in 1997.

The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	DEC plans $50 million fuel lab: Governor requests $38 million in federal aid for facility in Malta  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	305 words  	Dec. 31--MALTA -- New York state is planning a $50 million alternative-fuels lab here at the Saratoga Technology and Energy Park.LiNeBrEaKGov. David Paterson has requested $38 million in federal assistance for the 80,000-square-foot facility, which would be owned and operated by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Paterson sent a letter Monday to President-elect Barack Obama requesting the aid. LiNeBrEaKThe lab would employ 30 people and would include offices, climate-control equipment and a high bay vehicle-prep area.LiNeBrEaKThe project is contingent on receipt of the federal money.LiNeBrEaKDEC spokeswoman Lori Severino said Tuesday the facility would focus on emission testing of light and heavy-duty cars and trucks and their engines. The goal would be to see how new technologies and fuels compete against existing engines and fuels on environmental impact, including greenhouse gases and energy efficiency.LiNeBrEaK"The facility will also be used to develop and evaluate various retrofit technologies in order to reduce emissions from older technology vehicles," she said.LiNeBrEaKThe state-owned energy park, known as STEP, adjoins the Luther Forest Technology Campus, off Northway Exit 12 in Malta, where Advanced Micro Devices Inc. will build a $4. 6 billion computer chip factory.LiNeBrEaKThe fuel testing facility also will work with Hudson Valley Community College in Troy to develop technician-training programs for the latest auto technologies.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday   Final Edition	School: Banish 'green,' 'bailout'  	News; Pg. A7  	423 words  	DETROIT A movie about a "maverick," his journey "from Wall Street to Main Street," his "desperate search" for a "monkey" and a "game-changing" revelation about his "carbon footprint" probably would make the nation's word-watchers physically ill. All those words and phrases are on Lake Superior State University's annual List of Words to Be Banished from the Queen's English for Mis-use, Over-use and General Uselessness. The 34th version of the list was released Tuesday, which means, "It's that time of year again."  LiNeBrEaKThe school in Michigan's Upper Peninsula selected entries from about 5,000 nominations. Despite the year's economic meltdown (which itself wasn't banished, but don't rule it out for next year), the most entries came from the environmental category for "green" or "going green." "If I see one more corporation declare itself 'green,' I'm going to start burning tires in my backyard," wrote Ed Hardiman of Bristow, Va., in his submission. Nominators also had their fill of "carbon footprint" the amount of greenhouse gases an individual's lifestyle produces. Also knocked was "first dude," a term adopted by Todd Palin, the husband of the Republican vice presidential nominee, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. "Monkey" was on the list because of what some see as its rampant use as a suffix. "Especially on the Internet, many people seem to think they can make any boring name sound more attractive just by adding the word 'monkey' to it," wrote Rogier Landman of Sommerville, Mass. The school's annual quest to throw lexicon logs on the fire always gets some end-of-the-year attention for the school in Sault Ste. Marie, the last stop before Michigan's northern border crossing with Canada. But the list is more about letting off steam and offering laughs than performing any verbal vanishing act. "We get several nominations for the same word or phrase, and we still get nominations for words and phrases that have been on previous years' lists," said the university's spokesman, Tom Pink. "'At this point in time' was on the first list in 1976, and it continues to be nominated every year. People still hate it."

Vallejo Times Herald (California) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	From bankruptcy to Obama, a look back at 2008  	OUR VIEW  	5552 words  	A look back at how the Times-Herald's editorial board saw the year 2008, with some assist from the sharp pens of syndicated cartoonists:LiNeBrEaKJan. 2 -- A list for a better 2008LiNeBrEaKThis past year was one for thinking and living green. And the environment promises to stay a top priority in 2008.LiNeBrEaKBut the country has not proved to be a world leader on climate change, reflecting a go-slow Bush administration that opposes mandatory emissions cuts. Serious progress will have to wait for a new administration in 2009.LiNeBrEaKJan. 4 -- Crucial caucus?LiNeBrEaKThe ridiculously early launch of the presidential nominating process means the American people already are the losers.LiNeBrEaKWhen Iowa, a modestly sized Midwest state of 3 million people -- caucusing, not voting, mind you -- has such an over-sized say in who will become president in 2008, we have a problem. When just 200,000 citizens -- about 6 percent of the state -- gets to tell us who the new front-runners are -- in this case Mike Huckabee and Barack Obama -- we have a very big problem.LiNeBrEaKJan. 8 -- Zoo tragedyLiNeBrEaKMany crucial questions remain unanswered in the case of the fatal mauling of San Jose's Carlos Souza Jr. on Christmas Day at the San Francisco Zoo.LiNeBrEaKIt's painfully obvious that the barrier that separated the 350-pound Siberian tiger from zoo patrons should have met -- at the very least -- the minimum zoo industry standards. The zoo's entire security system should be re-evaluated to ensure no other deficiency exists.LiNeBrEaKJan. 10 -- State of the stateLiNeBrEaKGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ended his State of the State speech Tuesday by renewing his call for bipartisanship to end the state's vast budget crisis. But if he really considers legislators his full "partners," then he should not have ruled out increasing revenue.LiNeBrEaKHis pledge not to raise taxes and to rely on across-the-board spending cuts to erase a $14 billion -- and growing -- deficit conflicts with the core position of most Democratic legislators. We bet most Californians will also reject that approach, once they understand the implications of the massive budget cuts on schools, public colleges and vital state services.LiNeBrEaKThe governor has staked out a hard position. Now, it's time for him to seek common ground.LiNeBrEaKJan. 15 -- A capitol mistakeLiNeBrEaKToday, the imposing red brick building with its white doric columns on Benicia's First Street, is open to the general public as a reminder to visitors of days gone by.LiNeBrEaKInside, an American flag bearing 31 stars hangs from the north wall, overlooking the former state Assembly chambers where 63 lawmakers once considered such weighty issues as slavery seven years before the Civil War.LiNeBrEaKSome day, if Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has his way, this former capitol of California may shut its doors due to a sea of red ink deeper than the nearby Carquinez Strait. We believe the closure of this monument to democracy would be a huge mistake, and detrimental not only to Benicia, but to all Californians.LiNeBrEaKJan. 20 -- A Benicia rushLiNeBrEaKAnyone not paying the closest attention to Benicia school district politics lately, may be in for a surprise. Or two.LiNeBrEaKThere's a new school board member, or perhaps you hadn't heard.LiNeBrEaKAt its Thursday night meeting, the board appointed Dana Dean as the new trustee.LiNeBrEaKDean will replace Dirk Fulton, who suddenly resigned for personal reasons the day after Christmas -- when schools were out, the district was closed, and most parents were paying attention to the holidays, not district politics.LiNeBrEaKA real estate and land use attorney, Dean, 48, brings some legal expertise to the board that was lost with the departure of Fulton, also an attorney.LiNeBrEaKThe problem with Thursday night's selection is that anyone from the public unfamiliar with Dean has had no time to take more than a first look -- or give input to this public board.LiNeBrEaKJan. 22 -- Hate can't winLiNeBrEaKThe despicable excuses for human beings who hung that noose hanging from a pedestrian bridge over Interstate 780 on MLK Day can no more detract from the message of hope and unity that Monday evoked than can the actual object of their actions. Let's see -- a piece of rope with a running knot, signifying nothing but the kind of evil that all decent humans hope is becoming hopelessly outdated ... or the still glimmering words of the late Dr. King, gloriously echoing throughout the United States on Monday, from churches to streets to presidential campaign rallies.LiNeBrEaKThat one's not even close.LiNeBrEaKFeb. 7 -- California countsLiNeBrEaKThis time around, California really counted. And as a result of the high-stakes drama here and throughout the nation Tuesday, there's plenty more counting -- and voting -- to be done.LiNeBrEaKMore votes, more involvement, more debate. That's putting the Super in Super Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKWins for Sen. Hillary Clinton on the Democratic side and Sen. John McCain on the Republican side were indeed huge, giving each the kind of crucial rallying point -- not to mention a nice chunk of delegates -- that only comes with winning the big kahuna that is California, the nation's most populous state. The major bragging rights notwithstanding, Tuesday night's marathon of primaries and caucuses was by no means the end-of-the-line showdown so many pundits spent so many months assuring us it was.LiNeBrEaKFeb. 8 -- Keep good times rollingLiNeBrEaKBowling is one of the few sports available to just about everyone. But not for long -- unless Vallejo city officials step in.LiNeBrEaKFor the past half century, generations of Vallejoans have enjoyed bowling at Kentwig Lanes. But when owner George Hartman passed away in October, the bowling alley was put in peril.LiNeBrEaKHartman's son Richard said his dying father didn't want to burden his mother with the business, so his father hastily signed a contract to sell Kentwig to a developer who plans to turn it, along with Millennium SportsClub, into an apartment complex.LiNeBrEaKFor many reasons, we hope the city will save its only remaining bowling alley.LiNeBrEaKThe first is that Hartman would have wanted it that way.LiNeBrEaKFeb. 15 -- The USS IowaLiNeBrEaKThere are Vallejoans and others, however, who want the USS Iowa's true final resting place to be where many other ships had their beginnings -- at nearby Mare Island. They see in the Iowa far more than a rusting and barnacle-laden vessel that's seen better days.LiNeBrEaKThey see the same battleship that helped save and protect Allied soldiers in two wars being converted into a floating museum to help rescue Vallejo from a frightening slide into a sea of red ink.LiNeBrEaKBut if the USS Iowa is ever going to escape the mothball fleet for a new home at Mare Island, money -- a lot of it -- may be the only thing that will keep this idea afloat.LiNeBrEaKFeb. 17 -- Constructive graffitiLiNeBrEaKAs part of a federally funded program, students at Vallejo and Hogan high schools are painting murals after classes not only to add some color to their otherwise drab campuses and but also, hopefully, to discourage the type of gang graffiti that plagues many schools.LiNeBrEaKThis effort, helped by local artist Harold Beaulieu, brings about positive messages of creativity, beauty and fellowship not only to the local high schools, but to the entire community. In an era when art programs are disappearing in cash-strapped school districts, this program gives budding artists, or even those who just want to try painting, a way to work with fellow students on a project. Years from now their work will leave an artsy snapshot for future students of what influenced them.LiNeBrEaKFeb. 20 -- A city treasureLiNeBrEaKIf you love Vallejo -- and all our current financial, school, public safety and new business woes notwithstanding, there is indeed plenty to love -- do yourself a favor:LiNeBrEaKFind Lou Burgelin, chat him up, pull down a chair, and listen.LiNeBrEaKIf Vallejo had an official city quarter, Lou Burgelin's mug would be on it. This community icon is so much that is good about Vallejo. And if, at 92 years young, he's still finding it worth sticking around, well then, something good must be going on here.LiNeBrEaKThrough the years, this Vallejo treasure has picked up more than a few stories about his beloved home town. They're well worth listening to -- as a fascinating journey to where we've been, and valuable insight to where we're going.LiNeBrEaKBurgelin should have a rapt audience on March 1, when he is honored with "A Vallejo Community Tribute to Lou Burgelin" a fund-raising event for the Mare Island Historic Park Foundation. The humble side of Mr. Burgelin no doubt wouldn't mind seeing the spotlight shone elsewhere, but we can only share the reaction of so many of the friends and dignitaries scheduled to honor this graceful gentleman.LiNeBrEaKIt's about time.LiNeBrEaKFeb. 26 -- Victory for AmCanLiNeBrEaKWe congratulate the Napa Unified School District for resisting the temptation to scale back the size of American Canyon's first high school.LiNeBrEaKReducing the yet-to-be-built school to accommodate 1,700 students instead of the earlier planned 2,200 would have saved the district about $6 million.LiNeBrEaKGiven the current economic slump, the housing slide and the ever-growing state deficit, the district board could have been forgiven for being prudent and opt for the smaller version of the new school.LiNeBrEaKBut members agreed that this, like previous slumps, too will pass and stayed the course. Had they postponed construction in a wait-and-see mode, it could have cost the district an additional $12 million.LiNeBrEaKLast Thursday's decision is good news for American Canyon students, who someday will graduate from their own high school after years of attending Vintage High in Napa.LiNeBrEaKFeb. 27 -- Missing SoderbergLiNeBrEaKMary Soderberg was everything an elementary school principal should be. And for that matter, everything a human being should be.LiNeBrEaKSoderberg, who served Vallejo families for 33 years, died Sunday after battling multiple illnesses.LiNeBrEaKThe longtime educator didn't just impact local education during those three decades, but also countless lives.LiNeBrEaKAs a teacher, and then Highland Elementary School's principal for 17 years, thousands of children passed through the doors of her classroom, and later, her school.LiNeBrEaKWhen they did, they encountered someone dedicated to helping them learn what they'd need to succeed in life. And that was more than just reading, writing and arithmetic.LiNeBrEaKFeb. 28 -- Bankruptcy?LiNeBrEaKThe moon re-emerged from behind Earth's shadow last week, leading us to wonder if Vallejo will likewise emerge from behind a very real bankruptcy threat.LiNeBrEaKMonths after new Mayor Osby Davis and city negotiators began a less confrontational approach to labor talks, the two sides appeared last Friday to have discovered common ground, shaky though it may have been.LiNeBrEaKAnd, not a moment too soon. Money and time are both running out, while nearly two dozen public safety workers already have.LiNeBrEaKWhatever plan is considered and adopted will need a unified buy-in for any hope of success. So, it's time to get started, and -- we don't mind adding -- it's also time for a few egos to be left at the door.LiNeBrEaKVallejo's fiscal crisis will last much longer than a lunar eclipse, but if the commitment is made, this city can emerge from this ominous shadow brighter than ever.LiNeBrEaKMarch 3 -- A deal worth a tryLiNeBrEaKMayor Davis knows the pitfalls of a bankruptcy deal all too well, and is still determined to go the bankruptcy route only as a last resort. Despite the vocal protesters on Saturday, we're convinced most voters agree to give him a chance to try. In a very short time in office, the mayor has already gotten further with the unions than the previous council majority did over the past two years.LiNeBrEaKFinally, this crisis won't be solved with ill-conceived and divisive political efforts that may delay any solutions. Vallejoans must show each other and all who are watching that this city can and will unite to help itself. Anything short of that could be disastrous.LiNeBrEaKMarch 19 -- State champs!LiNeBrEaKThe Lady Bruins of St. Pat's: State Division IV basketball champions.LiNeBrEaKAmong its many other considerable upsides, it makes for a nice Google alert.LiNeBrEaKIt certainly beats "bankruptcy" "financial ruin" and "fiscal woes."LiNeBrEaKFor the better part of this week, anyway, Web cruisers and others who clicked on to find word of the latest goings on in Vallejo were given a welcome respite from the seemingly endless tide of news of financial catastrophe.LiNeBrEaKNow, instead, their newspapers, televisions, radios and computers gave them a different view, a decidedly more pro-Vallejo message.LiNeBrEaKState champions.LiNeBrEaKNow that's more like it.LiNeBrEaKMarch 20 -- A chance to move onLiNeBrEaKIt brought a sigh of relief this week to hear Gary Cloutier was dropping his lawsuit over the Vallejo mayor's race.LiNeBrEaKThe timing couldn't be better to end the five-month election trial that's dogged not only Cloutier, but also Vallejo, which can't afford for it to continue.LiNeBrEaKIt's time for Vallejo to move on and focus on the issues at hand.LiNeBrEaKApril 13 -- Graffiti compromiseLiNeBrEaKIt seems American Canyon City Council has found a good compromise for combating the city's growing graffiti problem without flouncing residents.LiNeBrEaKThe city originally had considered an ordinance allowing city workers to clean up graffiti on private property, and charge the property owners if they didn't clean up the mess fast enough.LiNeBrEaKWe argued this would further victimize property owners, already victimized by the graffiti. We were particularly concerned about residents who couldn't afford to pay.LiNeBrEaKBut the council threw out that ordinance, and is now looking at a more reasonable solution. Under the new proposal, given the council's initial OK earlier this month, property owners still would be responsible for removing the graffiti. But the city would pay up to $300 of the associated costs.LiNeBrEaKAnyone refusing to remove reported graffiti could be brought to court and fined. That seems a little harsh, but we understand the city's concern.LiNeBrEaKApril 20 -- Huge margin of errorLiNeBrEaKNearly a year ago City Manager Joe Tanner informed our readers that Vallejoans resoundingly had told pollsters they wouldn't pay more taxes for city services.LiNeBrEaKThat wasn't exactly true, and we suspect Tanner knew that.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, according to the city-funded survey that Tanner chose not to release, when it came to police and fire services, more than two-thirds of theLiNeBrEaK602 Vallejoans surveyed said just the opposite. Calling public safety a "top priority," they said they would willingly pay more.LiNeBrEaKAnd a similar majority opposed any more public safety cuts.LiNeBrEaKThese sentiments were gathered more than a month before the City Council OK'd such cuts -- at Tanner's urging.LiNeBrEaKTanner knew how those surveyed residents felt, but he decided, apparently, to misrepresent the results rather than simply disclose them. At least one council member, who had repeatedly asked for them in vain, went so far as to say that Tanner "suppressed" the numbers. We must agree.LiNeBrEaKTanner's explanation for his actions won't be answered here, because he's not speaking to the Times-Herald these days. (More on that later.)LiNeBrEaKSo we, and the public, are left to speculate about Tanner's motives.LiNeBrEaKMay 1 -- Fight cancer ... wear purple LiNeBrEaKWill a reign of purple splashed throughout our county cure cancer today? No, but with purple traditionally known as the color of courage, it will serve as a colorful reminder that this honorable fight, with strong, passionate survivors gallantly manning the front lines, continues.LiNeBrEaKWe may not have won -- yet -- but nobody is quitting.LiNeBrEaKMay 9 -- BankruptLiNeBrEaKBankruptcy and time are inseparable factors that Vallejoans learned first-hand Tuesday night will now guide their uncertain future.LiNeBrEaKOther divisive factors, however, forced a frustrated, yet unanimous, City Council to reluctantly move to seek fiscal protection under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.LiNeBrEaKNow that the die has been cast, there appears -- on the surface anyway -- to be no turning back from this drastic course.LiNeBrEaKBut there is a way. Bankruptcy for Vallejo is only a certainty if people allow it to be so. The city can't stop time, but in what little remains there are people who can find ways to resolve this crisis in what little precious time remains.LiNeBrEaKMay 10 -- Bravo, Mr. GrahamLiNeBrEaKWhen it comes to helping young people, Philmore Graham is like a gracious bulldog.LiNeBrEaKFounder of one of Vallejo's most effective youth organizations, Graham has defined the word tenacity in fighting for his beloved Continentals of Omega Boys and Girls Club.LiNeBrEaKLike a pit bull who won't let go, he's been relentless, stubborn, unremitting in pushing for community support including funding, media attention, parent involvement, volunteers -- whatever it's taken -- to make the club successful.LiNeBrEaKAnd he's done it for the past four decades -- plus.LiNeBrEaKJune 4 -- If not Wal-Mart, what?LiNeBrEaKAs Wal-Mart pulls out of Vallejo's future, we look back at last year's MacArthur Maze Miracle repair job, and can't help wondering -- if that massive job can be finished in just weeks, why does it take months to finalize plans to reopen the old Wal-Mart with a new Home Depot?LiNeBrEaKIn large part, the city's red tape has led to the red ink now threatening to drown Vallejo. Now more than ever, what's needed instead is a red carpet.LiNeBrEaKWhat will it take?LiNeBrEaKAnd when?LiNeBrEaKJune 7 -- Change, anyone?LiNeBrEaKThat was no mere earthquake in Solano County's Green Valley on Election Night.LiNeBrEaKThat was voters in the 2nd Supervisorial District shifting power from John Silva to Green Valley challenger Linda Seifert. What was a heated, contentious race that many thought would be close became an Election Night blowout, with Seifert claiming 62. 5 percent of vote.LiNeBrEaKSeems that whole "change" mantra worked its way to Solano County.LiNeBrEaKJune 15 -- Get involved, parentsLiNeBrEaKShortly after becoming school superintendent, Mary Bull told us that she'll push parents to become more active in their children's schooling. We're glad to hear she's following through on this most important of goals, trying to increase parental involvement and break the agonizing annual cycle of the city's chronically mediocre test scores.LiNeBrEaKParents, it's up to you to see that she succeeds, so your kids can, too.LiNeBrEaKJuly 15 -- Troubled infrastructureLiNeBrEaKWhether it's roads, potholes, or subterranean pipes, Vallejo seems to be moving in a downward spiral that won't bottom out any time soon -- if ever.LiNeBrEaKAs recent water main bursts under Couch Street show, nothing lasts forever, unless of course it's the frustration over how to avoid future breaks and resulting flooding. Two breaks in as many days last week underscore how fragile Vallejo's aging infrastructure is.LiNeBrEaKLeaky pipes and crumbling streets. Fixing either will cost far more than the city can afford. So, fasten your seatbelts, Vallejo, your bumpy rides and dry faucets will continue.LiNeBrEaKJuly 20 -- Looking into the glassLiNeBrEaKWe're often accused of viewing the glass as half-empty, and there are times that's true.LiNeBrEaKSo, today, we'll look at the glass as 59 percent full.LiNeBrEaKIndeed, according to new state numbers, a majority of Vallejo's kids do indeed graduate from public high school. In recent stories on hundreds of studetns receiving their diplomas, we highlighted those who not only prized their educations, but are determined to continue them.LiNeBrEaKThat more than 41 percent of Vallejo's high school kids won't don their caps and gowns, as reported this past week by state officials, should be no cause for alarm, right? Even though the statewide average is a disturbing 24 percent?LiNeBrEaKSorry, we held out the half-full glass as long as we could.LiNeBrEaKJuly 30 -- Bush's deficitLiNeBrEaKThe White House has disclosed that the Bush administration will be leaving behind a nasty house-warming gift for the next president: a record budget deficit of $482 billion in fiscal 2009.LiNeBrEaKSince the fiscal year begins before President Bush leaves office, if that forecast holds -- and it may even be on the low side -- Bush will have set the records for the first, second, third, fourth and fifth highest federal deficits ever. Not bad considering that when he took office the country had had four straight years of budget surpluses and had started to pay down the national debt, now also at record levels.LiNeBrEaKAug. 1 -- Miller's legacyLiNeBrEaKThis year at St. Patrick-St. Vincent High School, those gathering to Celebrate, Remember and Fight Back at the 10th annual Relay for Life won't see Sharon Miller in their ranks. But she'll be there, you can count on it.LiNeBrEaKAug. 20 -- Phelps makes a splashLiNeBrEaKOnce in a lifetime, there comes an athlete who accomplishes the impossible -- or, at least, what had been considered impossible.LiNeBrEaKIf you've been following the summer Olympic games in Beijing, you know that the athlete for this generation is Michael Phelps.LiNeBrEaKIt's simply been awe-inspiring.LiNeBrEaKAug. 24 -- Silence isn't goldenLiNeBrEaKCity Manager Joe Tanner is affected by Vallejo's bankruptcy action. So, by the way, is the guy who sweeps the City Hall steps.LiNeBrEaKAs are the guys who trim the trees, fix the broken water mains, the women who dispatch emergency calls, and even those guys who race into burning buildings to save lives.LiNeBrEaKBut apparently Tanner believes he's one of a very select few who should be able to publicly talk about how bankruptcy affects him and Vallejo's public employees.LiNeBrEaKHe's wrong.LiNeBrEaKTanner couches a new sweeping directive to city employees in disingenuous terms, but the underlying message is transparent: If a reporter asks you about bankruptcy and how it affects either you or the city, you'd better clam up.LiNeBrEaKUntil now, the bankruptcy debate has been multi-sided, both from within and outside City Hall. Driving part of that debate underground as Tanner's directive surely will do, is not only an assault on open government, but also an unwarranted slap at the intelligence of Vallejo residents.LiNeBrEaKSept. 4 -- The Garcia tragedyLiNeBrEaKFor years, political activists, officials, followers and critics of all stripes have bemoaned the lack of involvement by young people in a greater common cause.LiNeBrEaKAnd then there's Matt Garcia, whose inspiring story helps alleviate those concerns.LiNeBrEaKWhile nothing could touch the personal, family and friends-driven tragedy of the young Fairfield City Councilman's senseless shooting, the deep sense of sorrow after the shooting of this dynamic, motivated, purpose-driven man is the kind felt by all.LiNeBrEaKThe loss of someone like Garcia, and what he represented, hurts us all. No one with a gun can take away his legacy. We hope those left behind will work to see this young man's dreams for Fairfield will be realized.LiNeBrEaKSept. 7 -- No fairytale at LincolnLiNeBrEaKOn a very hot morning in early September, only days after Lincoln Elementary School's doors had once again swung open for yet another school year, word came from afar of an astounding nature.LiNeBrEaKIn their own quiet way, the students at tiny Lincoln Elementary had achieved record high scores in reading, writing and math. More impressive was the news that these scores came from the only Vallejo school to reach and surpass statewide goals set for public schools.LiNeBrEaKWhat happened at Lincoln was no fairy tale, but just like a fairy tale, we can be certain that for one brief moment, everyone at Vallejo's tiny school will live happily ever after.LiNeBrEaKSept. 10 -- Time to get to workLiNeBrEaKHe didn't mince words, and he left no doubt what he meant or how he felt.LiNeBrEaKAs far as federal bankruptcy Judge Michael McManus is concerned, the city of Vallejo is insolvent. No question about it.LiNeBrEaKAs far as McManus is concerned, after nearly a dozen court sessions and a mountain of legal briefs, the city has tried numerous ways out of bankruptcy and simply could not find one.LiNeBrEaKNot by itself, anyway.LiNeBrEaKRegardless of where you might stand on the bankruptcy question, there's only one clear path to solvency and that runs directly into public employee union agreements that Vallejo can no longer afford.LiNeBrEaKAs we stated on May 9 -- two weeks before the city filed its Chapter 9 bankruptcy petition -- the unions must accept the reality that not only does this fiscal emergency exist, it will be resolved only with their help.LiNeBrEaKGiven the magnitude of this crisis, there is no more time to waste, and no greater incentive than the city's future to discover a fiscally sound path to it.LiNeBrEaKSept. 20 -- A new era at schoolLiNeBrEaKAttention given to the three vital Rs in some local schools is slowly giving way to the three annoying Cs -- Cell phones, Cameras and Crime.LiNeBrEaKIn Benicia, starting in January, stiff fines will be imposed on students caught in public during school hours. We're skeptical this effort will work, despite its being in tandem with other anti-truancy efforts, but it's worth a try. We'd rather see the threat of fines become an adequate deterrent to playing hooky, but sense that shelling out $50 (for the first offense, up to $200 for repeats) will merely drive truancy underground or outside Benicia altogether.LiNeBrEaKAs for Vallejo, new security cameras that not only watch for vandalism outside schools after hours, but also problems while classes are in session pose privacy questions that cannot be ignored. We understand that destruction or vandalism costs the district hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, as well as being a scary distraction to children, but hope that these cameras are not abused.LiNeBrEaKSpeaking of abuse, the Vallejo school district's new anti cell phone camera policy is one that could pose similar problems. While district security cameras don't, for obvious reasons, require prior permission to record movements of students, students are not afforded the same freedom under the new rules. Under the new policy, students will be required to obtain permission from anyone who they videotape on their cameras. We can see the merit in such a rule; we suspect, however, it will be nearly impossible to enforce.LiNeBrEaKSept. 23 -- A worthless budget dealLiNeBrEaKThat metallic clang you hear is the state budget can being kicked down the road -- again.LiNeBrEaKThe governor and Legislature last week finally reached an accord to end the record-long budget standoff that had left California without a spending plan for nearly three months of the fiscal year. The governor obtained some major concessions from Democrats to bolster the state's "rainy day" fund in future years. Those changes will still need voter approval.LiNeBrEaKBut the budget deal didn't resolve the state's ongoing imbalance between revenues and expenditures. As a result, much of the shortfall lawmakers faced this year will rear its ugly head again next time.LiNeBrEaKAvoiding a repeat of our state's annual, embarrassing budget fiasco should be the goal of not just the governor, but every elected official in the Legislature. That's going to take a year's worth of solid leadership.LiNeBrEaKSept. 25 -- Get on with itLiNeBrEaKWe don't wish to micro-manage this whole adversarial thing between the city and the unions, but at some point the two sides will need to decide something, or a judge in Sacramento will do it for them.LiNeBrEaKDelaying the start of new talks for another week because of differences over ground rules sounds a lot like arguing who gets to steer the car when it plummets off the cliff.LiNeBrEaKBoth sides need to get it through their heads that city residents are sick and tired of the rope-a-dope shenanigans in this bankruptcy melodrama.LiNeBrEaKGet on with it.LiNeBrEaKOct. 2 -- Missing 'Z' oneLiNeBrEaKWith so much emphasis on test scores in today's public schools, it's easy to forget just how influential a great teacher can be outside of the classroom. But Friday's death of Vacaville's Tom Zunino brings that reminder.LiNeBrEaKThe coaching staffs at both Vacaville and Wood today are packed with people who either played for or coached with Mr. Zunino. They are his legacy. Through them, Mr. Zunino's emphasis on hard work, honesty, family and community will be communicated to new generations.LiNeBrEaKThose things aren't on any standardized test, but they are the lessons that are used throughout life. Vacaville is lucky to have known such a fine teacher.LiNeBrEaKOct. 3 -- Out of lineLiNeBrEaKDuring her 15 years on the board and before that the Vallejo City Council, Solano County Supervisor Barbara Kondylis has been known to engage in theatrics from time to time, but Tuesday's performance was over the top.LiNeBrEaKAfter complaining that she had been excluded in preliminary talks about developing the county fairgrounds in Vallejo, Supervisor Kondylis stormed off the dais. Then, speaking as a member of the audience, she accused the board of conducting an illegal meeting and back-room deals.LiNeBrEaKEven if she had been deliberately left out of the loop during preliminary talks -- and that's a big if -- to step off the dais and allow her constituents to be voiceless in a decision that will affect them most is inexcusable. Kondylis is one of Vallejo's voices on the board, but this time she misused it.LiNeBrEaKShe owes apologies to them and to her fellow board members.LiNeBrEaKOct. 4 -- Biden vs. PalinLiNeBrEaKSarah Palin held her own in her debate with Joe Biden, but her frequent dependence on cheerful phrases like "darn it" or "doggone it" and her avoidance of specifics and entire lines of questions will no doubt keep her critics on the attack.LiNeBrEaKBottom line: Palin's biggest task is convincing undecided voters that she could lead should she have to, and it's hard to see whether her performance, as clean as it was, held enough substance to sway them.LiNeBrEaKOct. 6 -- After the bailoutLiNeBrEaKThere they were, on the front of newspapers and Web sites late last week, smiling after an alleged job well done. Members of both political parties, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi leading the way, gazing adoringly at the historic $700 billion bailout of our nation's reeling banking system.LiNeBrEaKBravo, they told each other, basking in the glow of bipartisan success.LiNeBrEaKUgh. Spare us the pats on the back, please, while we pause to cringe again.LiNeBrEaKTo listen to the self-congratulatory rhetoric coming out of Washington was to forget two basic truths:LiNeBrEaKOur elected leaders should have never allowed such a financial calamity to occur in the first place.LiNeBrEaKAnd it shouldn't take us reaching the brink of financial disaster, complete with talk of another Great Depression, for both sides to put down the hatchets they use for those tiresome rounds of the blame game and finally work together to get things accomplished on a regular basis.LiNeBrEaKOct. 14 -- Signs, signs ...LiNeBrEaKWhen both local opponents and backers of Proposition 8 report that yard campaign signs have been stolen, then something more ominous than politics may be at work.LiNeBrEaKVallejo prides itself on its diversity. That diversity should extend beyond racial, economic, gender, age, religious and sexual orientation lines. It should include diversity of opinion, whether in a stated opinion or in something as simple as a yard sign.LiNeBrEaKOct. 31 -- 'Yes' on TLiNeBrEaKThe county's general plan is, in fact, contingent on the approval of Measure T. If voters say yes, Solano County residents can rest assured that there is a comprehensive plan for the future -- at least the next 20 years of it. If not, the county may have to go back to the drawing board on some elements.LiNeBrEaKThat would be a mistake.LiNeBrEaKSolano County has a solid plan in place, and Measure T should be its cornerstone. We encourage voters to say yes to Measure T on Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKNov. 1 -- 'No' on Prop. 8LiNeBrEaKWe understand that the issue of marriage is a very personal one and you must vote your values. We believe when the emotional and religious layers of arguments are peeled away, you will believe in equal treatment for all under the law.LiNeBrEaKPlease vote for equality. Vote "no" on Proposition 8.LiNeBrEaKNov. 2 -- Choosing McCainLiNeBrEaKThere is no perfect answer on Tuesday's ballot. The best advice we can offer is to find who you think is the best man -- not the best party -- for the job.LiNeBrEaKTo us, that means McCain. He is not President Bush, and he's earned a shot at his greatest round of public service yet.LiNeBrEaKNov. 5 -- Obama makes historyLiNeBrEaKWe congratulate President-elect Barack Obama on a victory for the ages. Over the past two years, the president-elect's masterful campaign rekindled enthusiasm in this nation's potential. At the same time he showed the world how far we have come on the path toward color blindness.LiNeBrEaKHis victory is also will be one for our future. The nation's hopes ride on his shoulders, and as voters we must now do our part to ensure his success.LiNeBrEaKNov. 23 -- County fiscal planLiNeBrEaKPerhaps the most important thing the board can do is to set its priorities now. Certainly public safety must be its No. 1 priority. Providing a safety net for people who have no other resources is No. 2.LiNeBrEaKBeyond that, it will be up to the board, with plenty of input from residents and staff, to figure out how to weather what is expected to be a long financial storm.LiNeBrEaKDec. 5 -- Voter turnoutLiNeBrEaKWe send out our congratulations today to the real winners of the Nov. 4 election: The voters of Solano County.LiNeBrEaKBy staggering margins, more of you either plodded to the polls or mailed in your ballots than in any election in memory.LiNeBrEaKNow, if these same voters can only get energized when those important issues closer to home are on the line -- like who sits on local city councils and school boards -- democracy will fare even better.LiNeBrEaKDec. 12 -- CC a YankeeLiNeBrEaKBig money sports is the world CC Sabathia has lived in for some time, long since his days of prodigious homers and eye-catching fast balls at Vallejo High School. All he did when he signed his record deal with the New York Yankees was upgrade to the luxury suite.LiNeBrEaKAnd who can blame him?LiNeBrEaKNot us.LiNeBrEaKDec. 28 -- Local support?LiNeBrEaKGiven the fiscal problems the Vallejo Naval and Historical Museum and the Empress Theatre are facing, we suggest that officials from both put their heads together and see if they can devise a plan to help each other survive this crisis.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	December 31, 2008 Wednesday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	Airline tests jet powered partly with biofuel  	FRONT; Pg. A6  	389 words  	By Ray LilleyLiNeBrEaKThe Associated PressLiNeBrEaKWELLINGTON, New ZealandLiNeBrEaKLooking to reduce its carbon footprint and cut its fuel bill, Air New Zealand on Tuesday tested a passenger jet that was powered partially with oil from a plum-sized fruit known as a jatropha . LiNeBrEaKThe airline is the latest carrier to experiment with alternative fuels, partly because of the threat of rising oil prices but also to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from aviation, which are projected to rise by 90 percent by 2020.LiNeBrEaKAir New Zealand said the two-hour flight from Auckland International Airport was the first to use what are known as second-generation biofuels to power an airplane. Second-generation biofuels typically use a wider range of plants and release fewer emissions than traditional biofuels such as ethanol.LiNeBrEaKOne engine of the Boeing 747-400 airplane was powered by a 50-50 blend of oil from jatropha plants and standard A1 jet fuel.LiNeBrEaK"Today, we stand at the earliest stages of sustainable fuel development and an important moment in aviation history," Air New Zealand Chief Executive Rob Fyfe said shortly after the flight.LiNeBrEaKAlong with investing in new technology to replace outdated fleets and new designs that reduce weight and air resistance, the International Air Transport Association says airlines are experimenting with a range of plant materials in an effort to find the jet fuel of the future.LiNeBrEaKThe association, which represents 230 airlines, said it wants 10 percent of aviation fuel to come from biofuels by 2017 as part of a broad climate change plan. Air travel now generates only 2 percent of global carbon emissions that are thought to contribute to global warming, but the industry's high growth rate has raised concerns about future emissions.LiNeBrEaK"There are very promising biojet fuels, and jatropha is one of them," association spokesman Anthony Concil said Tuesday, adding that the industry is also looking at switch grass, algae and salt-tolerant plants called halophytes.LiNeBrEaKJatropha is a bush with round, plum-like fruit that has been found in parts of South America, Africa and Asia. Seeds from jatropha are crushed to produce a yellowish oil that is refined and mixed with diesel.LiNeBrEaKTuesday's flight was a joint venture by Air New Zealand, airplane maker Boeing, engine maker Rolls Royce and biofuel specialist UOP LLC, a unit of Honeywell International .

Weatherford Democrat (Texas)  	December 31, 2008 Wednesday 	OPINION: Prediction: 2009 will be boring .. thank goodness  	COMMENTARY  	553 words  	Dec. 31--Have you ever wondered why psychics don't win the lottery more often? Well, other than the fact the entire psychic culture is a sham, it's an interesting question.LiNeBrEaKDid anyone predict the events of 2008, in writing, at this time last year? I doubt it. Nor can any of us predict the events of the new year, which begins tomorrow. Given such circumstances, here's a few predictions of my own. They are worth absolutely nothing, unless they turn out to be right.LiNeBrEaKn Prediction: Dallas Cowboy fans will wake up and realize that Tony Romo isn't that good of a quarterback. What defines the great ones is the post-season, and Mr. Romo is oh-for-three so far. LiNeBrEaKn Prediction: Gas will top out at $2. 70 this summer, a little higher than its natural price of $2. 50. Oil prices punched through the artificial barrier of $100 a barrel and got completely out of control this past summer. That much we know based on what happened on Wall Street in the fall. There was never a reason for summer gas to be higher than $2. 50 this past year, and the same is true for 2009.LiNeBrEaKn Prediction: Traffic in Weatherford will be bad. (Trying to make sure I got at least one right.)LiNeBrEaKn Prediction: The media will continue with its anointing of President Obama until ratings dip. Expect that in the November 2009 sweeps period, at the earliest.LiNeBrEaKn Prediction: Get ready for a nasty spring storm season. This past year was pretty active, but not historic, other than the ruthless hail storm that blew through. Look for an active spring with much wind.LiNeBrEaKn Prediction: The recession will drag on through the first three quarters of 2009 nationwide, but expect Texas to pull out of it quicker. (That's only if you believe that Texas is participating.)LiNeBrEaKn Prediction: Heath Ledger will win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor . His portrayal of the Joker in The Dark Knight was that good. The fact that he's dead is the clincher.LiNeBrEaKn Prediction: Health care costs will continue to spiral out of control as long as drug companies are allowed to advertise on television. (Okay, that's two right for sure.)LiNeBrEaKn Prediction: The Global Warming argument will lose steam, and Going Green will become old news. Like the gun control movement, the environmentalists reached too far, too fast. They should have taken a marketing lesson from the folks who turned smoking into a Crime Against Humanity.LiNeBrEaKn Prediction: The Rangers will not make the post-season baseball playoffs. (That's three!) However, the team's ERA will drop by half a point and they will finish in the top three of the AL West. Buy your tickets before Aug. 1, however, to see competitive baseball.LiNeBrEaKn Prediction: American Idol will produce yet another nameless, faceless, singer we all forget about by fall. Who won last year? Can you name more than two winners of that eight-year show?LiNeBrEaKn Prediction: Compared to 2008, 2009 will be relatively boring. Thank goodness.LiNeBrEaKHappy New Year!

Akron Beacon Journal (Ohio)  	December 30, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: State of warming  	COMMENTARY  	592 words  	Dec. 30--Ohio ranks fourth among the 50 states in generating greenhouse gases, emissions such as carbon dioxide that contribute to the warming of the planet. If Ohio were a country, it would rate 24th worldwide in emitting greenhouse gases. Those are just two of the compelling statistics included in the report "What's at Stake: How Global Warming Threatens the Buckeye State," released earlier this month by Environment Ohio.LiNeBrEaKToo often, the discussion about climate change seems removed and abstract, about developments toward the end of the century or in faraway places such as the Arctic. Environment Ohio brings into sharper focus the potential impact in this state -- with the worthy goal of heightening awareness and pushing Ohioans to act. No question, the state alone reducing greenhouse emissions would make little difference. Yet as a leading generator, Ohio could have considerable influence in pressing for a strategy. LiNeBrEaKWhat is at stake for the state?LiNeBrEaKOhio lawmakers rightly touted their recent passage of the Great Lakes Compact as sound stewardship of a most valuable resource. They had in mind preventing thirsty states from tapping into the largest source of freshwater in the world. The Arizonas and New Mexicos pose one threat. The Environment Ohio report identifies the danger in global warming, the water level of Lake Erie possibly declining by 3 feet to 6. 5 feet during the next 70 years. A decline of 4 feet would lower most of Sandusky Bay to less than 3 feet of water, inviting water plants to become an overwhelming and harmful presence.LiNeBrEaKThe report notes that commercial ships must leave behind 270 tons of cargo for every inch the level of Lake Erie drops, and then adds that a 2 percent decline in shipping activity could cost the economy more than $1 billion. A warmer Lake Erie puts at risk the habitat for coldwater fish, such as northern pike, walleye and whitefish.LiNeBrEaKThe potential harm to the economy and recreation extends to forests. Ohio could find the sugar maple, black cherry, white ash, even the buckeye tree, more vulnerable, their ranks retreating north. Birds would face altered migratory patterns. The agricultural industry (still employing one-seventh of Ohioans) would encounter a changing planting season. The delicate balance of biodiversity would be disrupted, an invasive species, say, wreaking havoc before the system as a whole could adjust.LiNeBrEaKAll told, Environment Ohio argues climate change could threaten 1. 9 million jobs that contribute $126 billion to the state economy.LiNeBrEaKSkeptics contend such estimates are little more than alarmist. They do so by pushing aside the powerful scientific consensus about global warming, human activity contributing decisively to the heating of the planet, the temperature in Akron in recent years two degrees above the 30-year average. Clearly, national and global action is required to combat climate change, the United States leading the way, China making its necessary contribution. What Environment Ohio has made plain is the role that Ohio leaders must play, pushing and preparing aggressively for action, emphasizing the cost if steps are not taken.

The Boston Globe 	December 30, 2008 Tuesday   THIRD EDITION	Choice of Warren reflects Obama's intent to include evangelicals  	NATIONAL; Pg. A2  	797 words  	National PerspectiveLiNeBrEaKMany of the Obamaphiles streaming into Washington for the inauguration will be looking for one type of president - the dynamic agent of change, ready to end the pain of the Bush years and usher in a liberal reformation. But Barack Obama seems determined to give them another type of president - a figure of national consensus, wise and honorable and able to soar above the political fray.LiNeBrEaKObama the candidate showed flashes of both approaches to leadership, and many voters were drawn to the idea that he might be the most liberal president in several generations. But it now seems clear that the vision of Obama as a liberal activist was the product of a handful of impressions that didn't make up a full picture. LiNeBrEaKThe first was his early opposition to the Iraq war, which led both supporters and opponents to believe he was a dove on foreign policy. The second was his racial background, which he advertised as proof of his ability to change the story in Washington, which was true enough but led many to believe he would be a full-throated advocate for groups long excluded from power. The third was his criticism of Bill and Hillary Clinton's politics of "triangulation" - undermining conservative opponents by borrowing some of their positions - which led people to believe he would do no such thing.LiNeBrEaKAll these were honest positions, and he hasn't backed away from them. But they managed to disguise that Obama's policies were no more progressive than Hillary Clinton's - and arguably less so on some issues such as healthcare. Moreover, his message of inclusion, which many liberals chose to read on their own terms - as an endorsement of gay rights and multiculturalism - was also aimed at red-state conservatives, whose religious values he mostly admired. LiNeBrEaKNow, Obama has nominated a Cabinet of highly familiar figures from a broad range of personal and political backgrounds, which most liberals have found acceptable, if not especially exciting. But his selection of Rick Warren, the evangelical minister and best-selling author of "The Purpose Driven Life," to deliver the invocation at his inauguration has served as a tip-off that Obama may not be exactly the type of change agent that many liberals have been expecting.LiNeBrEaKThough Warren has millions of followers, he's not especially well known on the national stage, and there is a blurriness about his politics. By some measures - such as his support for Proposition 8, which passed in November and blocked gay marriage in his native California - Warren is a figure of the religious right. But he has a more moderate tone than many evangelicals, and has emphasized some liberal concerns, such as the dangers of global warming, along with his conservative social message.LiNeBrEaKPeople who watched the nationally televised presidential forum at Warren's Saddleback Church in August got a hint of what was to come. Warren conducted separate interviews of Obama and John McCain before an audience of church members.LiNeBrEaKObama seemed especially eager to win Warren's approval, repeatedly calling him "Pastor Rick" and offering detailed answers to questions about his spiritual views. Obama was also uncharacteristically tongue-tied at times, either because he was trying so hard to sound sincere or because he was straining to win over a skeptical audience.LiNeBrEaKMcCain, by contrast, offered quick, simple answers and won the crowd's approval. Warren, for his part, seemed much more in tune with McCain, despite Obama's entreaties. Nonetheless, it was equally clear, even then, that Obama had identified Warren as someone he wanted to bring into the national discussion.LiNeBrEaKInviting Warren to give the inaugural invocation is not necessarily an endorsement of his political views, as some liberals insist. But it is an endorsement of another sort, giving Warren the chance to play the role of national pastor formerly occupied by Billy Graham.LiNeBrEaKObama is well aware of Warren's politics and the symbolism of his presence on the inaugural stand, and he is clearly signaling his determination to include evangelicals in his government of national unity.LiNeBrEaKObama does not want an administration dedicated to vindicating long-excluded groups, but rather one that shows how those who have been excluded can, once invited inside, become just as mainstream in their skills, credentials, and opinions as any member of the East Coast establishment: He believes the same to be true of evangelicals.LiNeBrEaKThe liberals who oppose Obama's choice of a pastor to offer the inaugural invocation may or may not have misjudged Warren, but it seems clear that they have misjudged Obama.

The Boston Globe 	December 30, 2008 Tuesday   THIRD EDITION	Letters  	LETTERS; Pg. A10  	419 words  	Transit priorityLiNeBrEaKRE "TRANSIT funds present quandary for Obama" (Page A24, Dec. 19): Appropriately "the goal of the stimulus bill is to kick-start the economy with a wave of short-term public spending projects across the country." LiNeBrEaKHowever, as a transportation engineering expert and an adviser to the US Department of Transportation, I'm convinced it's false that "the quickest way to do that is to follow existing priorities" - roads and highways. Bringing roads and bridges to a state of good repair, not building new roads, should be a priority.LiNeBrEaKResearch shows that transit spending creates more jobs than the same spending on new roadway construction. National studies show that every $1 billion communities invest in transit yields $6 billion in economic returns, creating 35,000 jobs.LiNeBrEaKMany ports are trying to invest in cleaner trucks and machinery. Stimulus money should also support diesel clean-up programs, replacing old trucks with new ones, installing and manufacturing filters, and helping truckers get the most advanced technologies.LiNeBrEaKNationally, transportation accounts for 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, and is the fastest-growing source of greenhouse gases. It's the nation's largest consumer of imported oil. Congress and states should focus stimulus spending on these clean air and energy independence measures to create more jobs than by building roads.LiNeBrEaKMichael A. ReplogleLiNeBrEaKTransportation directorLiNeBrEaKEnvironmental Defense FundLiNeBrEaKWashingtonLiNeBrEaKChristmas spirit hurtLiNeBrEaKTHE POOR taste of your Christmas Day editorial "The taming of Christmas" was so extreme that I cannot help but believe that there was a motive, possibly subconscious, but nevertheless there. I have no doubt about the incidents you cited, but you went on and on about rowdies and "prominent" families.LiNeBrEaKI am in my late 70s, and have experienced much that has not been very nice. Christmastime has always suggested opportunities for comfort and family enjoyment. Over the years it has been severely damaged and watered down by commercial exploitation, insistence on the use of "holiday" as opposed to "Christmas," and groups building up other so-called traditions within its period. More and more people are finding the sending of Christmas cards, fond remembrances, to be a nuisance. It is tough enough that much of the holiday's essence is more trite, and now, in the midst of such a difficult economy, your so-called family newspaper adds reinforcement to accelerate the loss of its sweetness.LiNeBrEaKDavid C.

The Boston Globe 	December 30, 2008 Tuesday   THIRD EDITION	SHORT FUSE  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A10  	407 words  	Help wanted: Honest police chiefLiNeBrEaKTomorrow is Hamilton Police Chief Walter Cullen's last day on the job, and if what two separate investigations allege is true, the people of the tony North Shore town are well rid of him. Cullen is accused of presiding over a scheme to falsify documents that police officers had received necessary training and certification to be Emergency Medical Technicians, which allowed them to operate an ambulance service and collect bonus payments even though they repeatedly failed to complete the requirements. Cullen's alleged actions implicated the majority of the force in the corruption and may have risked public safety. But at least Cullen won't be cashing in his $80,000 pension just yet; the Essex Regional Retirement Board correctly decided this week to withhold consideration pending the outcome of any criminal charges. LiNeBrEaKStimulus: When tax cuts don't workLiNeBrEaKThe US Commerce Department has reported that plummeting gasoline prices since the $4 per-gallon highs of this past summer have put so much money back into the pockets of drivers that it is the equivalent of a $200 billion tax break. This is touted as good news when layofffs are rife and foreclosures continue. Trouble is, worried consumers are pinching every penny of that bonus, as retailers sweeping up from a gloomy holiday season can attest. Republicans in Congress are pushing for tax breaks to business or more direct taxpayer refunds as part of any government stimulus program, but the Commerce report suggests what will really get Americans spending again is jobs. President-elect Barack Obama should keep his eye on the prize.LiNeBrEaKEvangelicals: Too outspoken a spokesmanLiNeBrEaKRichard Cizik was forced to resign earlier this month after 28 years as vice president for public affairs with the National Association of Evangelicals, despite expanding the flock among younger evangelicals with his calls for "creation care" on the environment. The last straw for the church hierarchy was Cizik's Dec. 2 interview with NPR's Terry Gross of "Fresh Air," in which he revealed he voted for Barack Obama in the Virgina primary and said he was growing more tolerant of civil unions (though not marriage equality) for gay couples. The worst part is that Cizik's departure will give cheer to rival Christian activists such as James Dobson, who wanted Cizik fired for his "relentless" campaign against global warming long before gay marriage was a big issue.

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 	December 30, 2008 Tuesday   Home Final Edition	Dusty and tired, but still seeing red;  NASA rovers set to celebrate five years on Mars 	NEWS - SCIENCE; Pg. 04B  	679 words  	They have been battered by dust, an inhospitable terrain and a workload that was never supposed to outlast their 90-day warranties.LiNeBrEaKBut in a week, the twin Mars rovers, Spirit and Odyssey, will celebrate five years of exploration.LiNeBrEaK(For the record, Spirit landed first, on Jan. 3, 2004, and Opportunity landed on Jan. 25, 2004.) LiNeBrEaK"They're like that old Volvo or Honda in your driveway; they keep running and running," said John Callas, rover project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.LiNeBrEaKAnd like those old cars, the solar-powered rovers are a little worse for wear.LiNeBrEaKOpportunity's infrared spectrometer has been blinded by dust, and one of its six wheels cannot be steered. Spirit is down to five wheels as well, and its rock abrasion tool is worn out.LiNeBrEaKBut both keep adding to the understanding of the Red Planet.LiNeBrEaK"Every time they've moved to different terrain, we've seen different things," said Geoffrey Landis, a scientist at the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland and member of the rover science team.LiNeBrEaKHe and the other 149 scientists supporting the mission are hoping that Spirit, which went into hibernation beneath a coating of dust and low sunlight, will reawaken and travel again now that the Martian spring has begun.LiNeBrEaKSpirit's targets are a mesa and a pit that might be the mouth of an ancient volcano. Both are about 300 yards south of its wintering ground.LiNeBrEaKOpportunity is to begin an 11-mile journey -- farther than it's traveled in five years -- to Endeavour crater.LiNeBrEaKAlong the way, Opportunity will examine rocks younger than those seen so far. This work might help scientists understand Mars' more recent history.LiNeBrEaKA group of mapping specialists at Ohio State University, led by Rongxing Li, continues to plan the routes the rovers travel.LiNeBrEaKDesigned to study the geology, the rovers have showed that "Mars was at one time habitable, 3. 5 billion to 4 billion years ago," Callas said.LiNeBrEaK"There was liquid water on the surface, so it had to have a thicker atmosphere ... and the average surface temperature was above freezing, warmer than today.LiNeBrEaK"It was more Earth-like."LiNeBrEaKWithout much atmosphere, the planet now bakes in sunlight and freezes in shade.LiNeBrEaKBy looking at the rocks and soil, Opportunity found evidence of an ancient saltwater ocean. Spirit found silica deposits.LiNeBrEaK"The silica is nearly pure; it's opal, basically," said Steve Squyres, a planetary scientist at Cornell University and science director of the rover mission.LiNeBrEaK"It's evidence of an ancient hydrothermal system like hot springs on Earth, which are teeming with life."LiNeBrEaKThis year, the Mars Phoenix lander confirmed that there is frozen water near the planet's north pole.LiNeBrEaKThe Phoenix froze and died in November, months after it landed on Mars.LiNeBrEaKCallas said he hopes that the rovers can provide clues to what made Mars' atmosphere grow thin and its surface water disappear.LiNeBrEaK"The big question is, why did Mars change, and can that happen to the Earth?"LiNeBrEaKWhile the rovers' survival on Mars is amazing, so is their longevity in NASA budgets. Early in 2008, NASA chiefs floated the idea of cutting $4 million from the rovers' $20 million annual operating budget, which would have forced the mission to put Spirit in extended hibernation.LiNeBrEaKThe proposed cut, however, was met with outcry and quickly scrapped.LiNeBrEaKThe cost of building and sending the rovers to Mars topped $800 million.LiNeBrEaKRunning the rovers is less expensive these days. At its peak, the project required 280 scientists and technicians. Today, there are about 60.LiNeBrEaKSquyres calls the rovers a priceless resource.LiNeBrEaK"To do anything but push them as hard as we can would be wasteful," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe rovers lack biological instruments to test for evidence of life or past life. Their successor, the Mars Science Laboratory, will do that when it is launched in 2011.LiNeBrEaKAlthough that project has been delayed, Landis said Spirit and Opportunity continue to provide invaluable information.LiNeBrEaK"We're learning how to make things work for a long time on Mars. The experience will help us make more capable rovers and eventually put people on Mars."

The Daily News of Los Angeles 	December 30, 2008 Tuesday   VALLEY EDITION	Solar energy remains a hot idea, despite flap  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A17  	582 words  	THE flap over the city's March 3 solar energy ballot measure, Measure B, while unfortunate and avoidable, should not obscure the merits of the proposal. After all, solar energy should not be a partisan issue since harnessing the sun's power is in everyone's best interest.LiNeBrEaKWhat is needed is more of a realistic view of this energy source that has bedeviled mankind for centuries. First, it isn't "free." Second, it will always cost a little more, but it carries broader economic and environmental advantages. LiNeBrEaKWith that understanding, voters can better deal with the political follies surrounding Measure B. As usual, the political insider games at City Hall once they became public have tainted a worthwhile initiative involving the city utility, the Department of Water and Power, which through a combination of local leadership and statewide pressure from Gov. Schwarzenegger's administration has caught the renewable energy bug.LiNeBrEaKWith solar, you have to start with the realization that it currently is one of the most expensive renewable, or pollution-free, ways to produce electricity, and the economics even within the solar space vary among individual home and small-business systems, larger industrial-size ones, and the huge solar-thermal projects proposed for the Southern California deserts.LiNeBrEaKMost of the signs are positive for solar development, but aside from the still-disputed cost of the DWP program that Measure B is supposed to help pay for there is no doubt that the cumulative cost of making solar a bigger part of our energy supply runs into the tens of billions of dollars category. And this is just part of the answer to a much more costly attack on global warming that will take decades and cost trillions of dollars.LiNeBrEaKA recent example is the approval by California regulators of a $2 billion, 120-mile transmission line in the southern end of the state to bring power supplies from still-to-be-built solar, wind and geothermal electricity projects in far-off Imperial County. San Diego County's ever-expanding population needs the green juice.LiNeBrEaKAn advantage for the Measure B-type program is that no added transmission lines need to be built. DWP will widely site smaller solar photovoltaic systems that convert sunlight to electricity and hook them to the existing grid system. The city utility will own and maintain the solar panels which, compared with traditional electric-generation plants, require little day-to-day maintenance.LiNeBrEaKAs the L.A. City Council's overly hurried action to put Measure B on the March ballot demonstrates, there is a lot of momentum behind solar energy development these days. Hopefully, policymakers will continue to see this and other renewable energy development as an added economic stimulus.LiNeBrEaKA recent two-year progress report on California's 10-year solar initiative for providing homes and businesses with incentives to install solar PV systems on their roofs indicated that some 414 megawatts worth of solar systems have been installed or have been approved for rebates, and an additional 150 megawatts is expected to be added in the next 12 to 18 months, bringing with it what the state energy agencies estimate will be an added $2. 5 billion of investment in the state's sagging economy.LiNeBrEaKWhile the City Council consultant's report on Measure B still deserves more public airing, it should not become a roadblock or detour to the state's current solar push. Solar is still a hot idea, and even more so in the environment and economy we face in 2009.

The Daily Star (Oneonta, New York)  	December 30, 2008 Tuesday 	The Daily Star, Oneonta, N.Y., Travels with Uncle Chet column: Travels with Uncle Chet: Kennedy may be claiming her destiny  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	659 words  	Dec. 30--COLUMBUS -- It was time for that annual trek into the spruces to claim a Christmas tree. We pulled on boots, gloves, hats, donned our coats and launched out the door.LiNeBrEaK"Make it a skinny one," said Hon as the storm door shut behind me.LiNeBrEaK"Make it a skinny one," I repeated to the troops. LiNeBrEaK"I always go for a skinny one," said Uncle Chet.LiNeBrEaK"You're a dog," said his niece, holding the bow saw at a dangerous angle.LiNeBrEaK"Woof woof," he said, and on we marched, single file, following Buddy, the 7-year-old scout who knew every tree in these parts.LiNeBrEaKThe snow was nearly a foot deep, fluffy on top, crunchy halfway down. Buddy's boots went only partway down and he glided forward easily. His sister's boots poked through every third or fourth step, frustrating her, and Uncle Chet and I plodded forward like noisy elephants.LiNeBrEaK"Glad we're not going to Kalamazoo," he said.LiNeBrEaK"So much for global warming," I said.LiNeBrEaK"It'll never last," he said. "But it's nice to see a little real winter."LiNeBrEaK"Actually, I love winter," I said, "whenever I don't have to go out."LiNeBrEaK"Can't beat it when the stove's cooking and wood box is full," he said.LiNeBrEaKWe walked for a while in the crisp morning air until Buddy called out, "I found one!" As we pulled up, he was standing before the tallest tree in the stand, a behemoth, anchoring one side of a clearing.LiNeBrEaK"Way too big," said his big sister.LiNeBrEaK"She's right," I said. "That's probably 25 feet tall."LiNeBrEaK"We can cut it, Dad," he said.LiNeBrEaK"The top is nice," the 10th-grader reconsidered.LiNeBrEaK"If it's not a Christmas tree now, never will be," said Uncle Chet.LiNeBrEaK"Are you kidding me?" I asked.LiNeBrEaK"It's crowding out everything else," he noted. "But you'll have to cut it twice."LiNeBrEaK"I should have brought the chain saw," I said.LiNeBrEaK"Should have," he agreed.LiNeBrEaK"Well, YOU wanted to cut it this year." I turned to the teenager, who was holding out the saw.LiNeBrEaK"I'll do the second cut," she said.LiNeBrEaK"And I'm a heart patient," said Uncle Chet.LiNeBrEaK"I guess that leaves me," I said.LiNeBrEaK"I'll do it!" said Buddy.LiNeBrEaK"Let's do it together." I bent back a branch and we crawled in toward the trunk until we were kneeling by it, in the snow. I began sawing, tender elbows bumping up on twigs and needles, fragrant crumbs of wet, white wood sprinkling on my knees.LiNeBrEaKIt was a workout, and I paced myself. Uncle Chet grabbed a branch when we got close and as the tree went over, he guided it to the ground.LiNeBrEaK"Right here's about nine feet from the top." He marked a place on the trunk.LiNeBrEaK"I'll get it." The little miscreant reclaimed the saw.LiNeBrEaK"Help yourself," I said.LiNeBrEaK"There's a tree's big enough for Caroline Kennedy," said Uncle Chet as we watched the younger generation take over.LiNeBrEaK"Senator Kennedy?" I asked.LiNeBrEaK"Hope so," he said. "It's hard to say why. Maybe it's her destiny, the only one left from Camelot, the girl on the pony riding onto the national stage to lead us from depression and war."LiNeBrEaK"This tree's all twisty," said the teen, who was blowing steam.LiNeBrEaK"Keep it up," I said.LiNeBrEaK"Caroline's our Princess Di," he said. "She's rich, but seems to understand how the other half lives. And with her Uncle Ted on the way out, she'll dedicate herself to the cause of his life: universal health care."LiNeBrEaK"That's what we need, above all else," I said.LiNeBrEaK"And with Obama, Clinton, Franken and Kennedy pushing hard, Uncle Sam might give a subsidy to regular people instead of corporations. Open up Medicare to everyone, so you can opt in, for say, $1,000 a year, and then you're covered."LiNeBrEaKCooperstown News Bureau Reporter Tom Grace is traveling with his Uncle Chet, who he says is imaginary. Grace's column appears every other week.

Daily Oklahoman  	December 30, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: New environmental team suggests change is in air  	COMMENTARY  	550 words  	Dec. 30--Environmental groups have great expectations for the Obama administration. They see opportunity everywhere for their agenda -- countering climate change, bolstering air and water quality standards, developing renewable energies and more. LiNeBrEaKSome of Obama's key personnel selections suggest dramatic change. Others indicate a more moderate approach. Today, we examine how Obama's team might shape environmental policy.LiNeBrEaKThere's little question Obama wants a more aggressive, mandated approach to curbing greenhouse gas emissions. His environmental appointments reflect a belief that restrictions are needed throughout the economy to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases.LiNeBrEaKThis is seen in the fact Carol Browner, who headed the Environmental Protection Agency during the Clinton administration and is a disciple of global warming "prophet" Al Gore, will coordinate energy, environmental and climate change policy from the White House itself.LiNeBrEaKLisa Jackson, Obama's pick to run the EPA, is considered a pragmatist but helped institute state global warming restrictions as New Jersey's top environmental officer. Designated White House science adviser John Holdren of Harvard and proposed National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief Jane Lubchenco are described by one critic as being "on the scientific fringe of global warming alarmism." The die appears cast.LiNeBrEaKThe question is how far the new administration will go with emissions caps and other mandates, which many agree will have adverse economic side effects, during a recession.LiNeBrEaKTexas Gov. Rick Perry recently told The Wall Street Journal that federal regulation of carbon dioxide emissions would be "absolutely economically disastrous" for his energy-producing state.LiNeBrEaKThe Heritage Foundation's Ben Lieberman writes that new EPA emissions rules would impose requirements "that border on the impossible" on any enterprise or activity using fossil fuels. The cost would exceed estimates for proposed cap-and-trade legislation that died in Congress this year, he writes, "reaching well into the trillions of dollars while destroying millions of jobs in the manufacturing sector."LiNeBrEaKAgain, Obama will be pressured to take an aggressive course by the environmental groups that helped elect him. But how far he will go in placing potentially significant drags on the economy is unclear.LiNeBrEaKIn other areas, significant change is likely. Offshore oil drilling championed by Republicans is out. Obama wants to spend billions on renewable energies, believing major job creation will follow. Efforts to limit the scope of the Endangered Species Act will end. Although Interior Secretary-designate Ken Salazar of Colorado is a Senate moderate, uses of public lands likely will be curtailed.LiNeBrEaKOn the environment, change clearly is coming. The speed and degree will depend on Obama's tendency to balance ideology with pragmatism.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	December 30, 2008 Tuesday   ALL S EDITION	Volatile weather and climate change;  The Public Pulse 	EDITORIAL; Pg. A7  	159 words  	On Christmas, as I was raking the snow off my roof in order to get ready for the heavy rains predicted for Friday and Saturday, I had to think how this put the whole climate change situation into perspective. LiNeBrEaKWhile there is no doubt the world has gotten warmer, the end result is not less snow here or in Seattle but unusual shifts in the weather.LiNeBrEaKWe can now expect 100-year floods every five or ten years, snow in Jerusalem or Seattle periodically, and snowfalls well above or below recorded amounts routinely.LiNeBrEaKSimply put, the shift in climate brought about by mankind in the last 100 years will break all the rules.LiNeBrEaKThe last business I would want to be in now is insurance, which sets its rates based on the expected frequency of any given event. What happened in the past is no longer a reliable predictor of what will happen in the future, so enjoy the record snowfalls while we can -- they may turn into record floods all too soon.LiNeBrEaKJERRY HAMELINK/Hudsonville	EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); WEATHER (90%); FLOODS and FLOODING (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%) Opinion  		SEATTLE, WA, USA (90%); JERUSALEM, ISRAEL (55%) WASHINGTON, USA (90%) UNITED STATES (90%); ISRAEL (55%)  	December 30, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Grand Rapids Press All Rights Reserved  								grp  														
Hindustan Times (New Delhi)  	December 30, 2008 Tuesday 	Gandhians unfazed as Mahatma's copyright ends  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	349 words  	Dec. 30--AHMEDABAD -- As 2008 gives way to the New Year, it will take away an era with it. All copyright on the works of Mahatma Gandhi will end on January 1, 2009. LiNeBrEaKAccording to Section 22 of the Copyright Act, 1957, works of a person go into the public domain 60 calendar years after his or her death.LiNeBrEaKIt means any publisher can publish the Mahatma's works -- running into run into over two lakh pages -- without seeking permission of or paying royalty to the Navajivan Trust, the sole custodian of Gandhiji's writings and speeches.LiNeBrEaKKeeping with the Mahatma's spirit, the Gandhian community is not perturbed over the possibility. "Gandhiji himself never wanted copyright law, but later accepted it following some misrepresentations of his writings," recalled Amrut Modi, Managing Trustee of the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust.LiNeBrEaKSince its inception in 1919, the Navajivan Trust has published over 300 volumes of compilations of his articles, letters and speeches apart from translations of his autobiography. Unfazed by the likelihood of  publishers picking up Gandhiji's works for a profit, Managing Trustee Jitendra Desai reasons: "Even in profiteering, they would propagate Gandhian thought"LiNeBrEaKThe Trust would continue to sell Gandhian works at subsidised prices, he said.LiNeBrEaKDesai said the Trust would "place before readers Bapu's views on various issues as and when it arises."LiNeBrEaKFor example, he said, when deliberations on global warming hot up, the trust would dig out the Mahatma's writings on human settlement and its linkages with environment to publish an anthology on the subject.

Hindustan Times (New Delhi)  	December 30, 2008 Tuesday 	Mahatma's copyright ends on Jan 1, Gandhians unfazed  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	287 words  	Dec. 30--AHMEDABAD -- As 2008 gives way to the New Year, it will take away an era with it. Copyright on all works of Mahatma Gandhi will end on January 1, 200 LiNeBrEaKAccording to Section 22 of the Copyright Act, 1957, a person's work goes into the public domain 60 years after his death.LiNeBrEaKIt means anybody can publish the Mahatma's works -- running into over two lakh pages -- without seeking permission of or paying royalty to the Navajivan Trust, the custodian of Gandhiji's writings.LiNeBrEaKBut the Gandhian community is not perturbed over the possibility.LiNeBrEaK"Bapu never wanted copyright law, but later accepted it following some misrepresentations of his writings," said Amrut Modi, managing trustee of the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust.LiNeBrEaKUnfazed by the likelihood of publishers picking up Gandhiji's works for a profit, Managing Trustee Jitendra Desai reasons: "Even in profiteering, they would propagate Gandhian thought."LiNeBrEaKDesai said the Trust would "place before readers Bapu's views on various issues as and when it arises". For example, he said, when deliberations on global warming hot up, the trust would dig out the Mahatma's writings on human settlement and its linkages with environment to publish an anthology on the subject. So, the Mahatma would remain relevant, even if the copyright has gone.

The report lays out the threats, including big changes in ocean temperature and chemistry, growing dead zones, toxic and nutrient runoff, rampant coastal development and global overfishing. LiNeBrEaKBut the report also notes "surprising gains in the traditionally abysmal quality of U.S. fishery management, and measures of hope resulting from the ways in which some citizens and political leaders are ... facing up to the need to curb greenhouse emissions."LiNeBrEaKInside ChinaLiNeBrEaKJames Fallows of The Atlantic (December) interviews Gao Xiqing, who oversees $200 billion of China's $2 trillion in dollar holdings.LiNeBrEaKHis answers sound more like Warren Buffett than Chairman Mao: The current U.S. path of high leverage and heavy borrowing isn't sustainable. The financial services sector is overcompensated, to the point of distorting the allocation of U.S. brainpower. Many derivatives serve only to cheat people and should be abolished.

North Adams Transcript (Massachusetts)  	December 30, 2008 Tuesday 	Lowe's still a go  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	597 words  	Dec. 30--NORTH ADAMS -- Almost five years after being purchased by Starwood Ceruzzi LLC, the former North Adams Plaza remains vacant -- broken signs, crumbling asphalt and plywood covered window and doors surround the once-vibrant shopping center.LiNeBrEaKHowever, plans to replace the decrepit and deteriorating with a $15 million Lowe's Home Imp-rovement store are still in the works, according to Jonathan Sa-bin, the local attorney representing project developer Starwood Cer-uzzi LLC of Fairfield, Conn. LiNeBrEaK"I have not received any indication from the project developer that plans are not moving forward," Sabin said Monday. "As far as I know, nothing has changed."LiNeBrEaKPlans for the property include a 126,000-square-foot Lowe's Home Improvement retail store, a 3,000-square-foot freestanding building in the southeast corner of the lot and a parking lot with roughly 620 parking spaces.LiNeBrEaKA lack of visible work on the project has left some local residents wondering if the country-wide economic recession had put a damper on the plans.LiNeBrEaK"Lowe's plans to locate here," Sabin assured. "I know that everyone is anxious to know what is going on. We're waiting to hear."LiNeBrEaKThe fate of the chain store came into question earlier this year, when State Secretary of Environmental Affairs Ian Bowles said in August that a 700-page Single Environ-mental Impact Report didn't pass the state's newly instated Green-house Gas Emissions policy'sLiNeBrEaKlitmus test. A supplemental report was filed in September and the plan received his final stamp of approval on Oct. 31.LiNeBrEaKDemolition of the vacant strip mall, which once housed Gringo's, Berkshire Fabric and Wallpaper and a Price Chopper, is expected to happen soon, Sabin said.LiNeBrEaK"Clearly, that is our next step," he said. "I don't know exactly when it will happen, but I suspect they will be applying for demolition permits soon."LiNeBrEaKStarwood Ceruzzi purchased the 14. 3-acre property in 2004 for $2. 5 million.LiNeBrEaKIn August, the state was expected to issue a certificate of compliance with MEPA standards. Instead, Bowles called for a supplemental report -- asking many questions, including why the company would not consider installing a photovoltaic (solar-powered) system that would cost between $350,000 and $450,000. He also questioned how Lowe's proposed to offset the emissions caused by 3,000 additional weekly car trips expected when the store opens at the former North Adams Plaza.LiNeBrEaKThe company provided information to the state in September, including a rebuttal listing all of the company's green and alternative energy measures, and new figures of greenhouse emissions caused by increased traffic flow. It also once again pointed out the 50-kilowatt solar panel system was not feasible.LiNeBrEaKIn his ruling on Oct. 31, Bowles wrote that he still encouraged Lowe's to consider the future installation of solar panels and to build the store so its roof could handle the weight of solar panels.LiNeBrEaKThe project still has to go before MassHighway to receive formal permission to change several curb cuts for the entrance and exits of the parking lot. Plans call for an entrance at the north-end of the lot and a right-turn only exit at the south-end of the lot.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	December 30, 2008 Tuesday 	UCD professor again trades beer for butterflies  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	404 words  	Dec. 30--Free beer for a butterfly?LiNeBrEaKIndeed.LiNeBrEaKArthur Shapiro, a professor at University of California, Davis, has launched his annual Butterfly-for-Beer contest and is hoping someone soon will turn in a live Cabbage White butterfly. LiNeBrEaKThe contest, which has been going on for 38 years, rewards the first person to turn in a live Cabbage White with a pitcher of beer or its cash equivalent, a UC Davis news release states.LiNeBrEaKWhat's in it for Shapiro? He gets more biological data on the butterfly.LiNeBrEaKThe Cabbage White butterfly, Pieris rapae, lives in the Central Valley and is white or buff-colored, about 1 1/4 inches long and might have a few black spots near the edges of its outer wings. Its underside is yellow with a gray hue. It often is spotted in vacant lots and by the side of roads where wild mustard grows, the release states.LiNeBrEaKShapiro, who teaches evolution and ecology courses for the university's entomology department, has found that the butterfly is emerging about a week earlier than it did 30 years ago, a shift caused by climate warming, he says.LiNeBrEaKIn past years, the first sightings of the butterfly ranged from Jan. 1 to Feb. 22. This year, the first specimen was caught Jan. 19.LiNeBrEaKCool, wet and cloudy conditions seem to delay the butterfly's appearance, while sunny and warm days speed it up, the release states.LiNeBrEaKThe contest is limited to adult butterflies captured outdoors in Sacramento, Solano or Yolo counties.LiNeBrEaKButterflies must be brought alive to the receptionist in the Evolution and Ecology office, 2320 Storer Hall, with full information about the time, date and place it was found.LiNeBrEaKIf a butterfly is captured on a weekend or holiday when the department office is closed, it can be stored alive for a few days in the refrigerator.LiNeBrEaK"Almost every year someone brings one in in May or June and asks 'Did I win?'" Shapiro wrote on his UC Davis-hosted Web site.LiNeBrEaKFor more information about the Cabbage White, go to http://butterfly.ucdavis.edu/butterfly/Pieris/rapaeLiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Niesha Lofing, (916) 321-1270	COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (91%); COLLEGES and UNIVERSITIES (90%); PRESS RELEASES (78%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (75%); EVOLUTION THEORY (67%); GLOBAL WARMING (66%); PROPERTY VACANCIES (53%); BEER and ALE (90%)  		SACRAMENTO, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 31, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Sacramento Bee   	Niesha Lofing, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.

Santa Cruz Sentinel (California)  	December 30, 2008 Tuesday 	Elkhorn Slough acquisitions help combat global warming  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	576 words  	Dec. 30--MOSS LANDINGLiNeBrEaKThe need to protect coastal marshes, where great seabirds journey and tiny shellfish scurry, has focused largely on saving wildlife.LiNeBrEaKThis month's expansion of the Elkhorn Slough, however, highlights another reason to care for the wetlands: global warming.LiNeBrEaKThree properties added in recent weeks to the federally and state-managed preserve mean more land to soak up water, a key to preventing flooding and lessening the impacts of sea-level rise as the Earth's climate warms, environmentalists say. LiNeBrEaK"The wetlands are not just for wildlife habitat, but serve the fundamental needs of humans," said Mark Silberstein, executive director of the Elkhorn Slough Foundation.LiNeBrEaKThe new properties, while expanding the 7,000-acre preserve by just 38 acres, serve as vital links to "connecting drainage bottoms", Silberstein says, which allows more water to percolate through the marshlands. In addition to nourishing plants and animals as well as the water supply, this means providing a buffer to warming.LiNeBrEaK"It's becoming painfully clear that we have to take care of these things," Silberstein said.LiNeBrEaKThe prospect of climate change has environmentalists pushing to restore and expand wetlands across the nation, perhaps most aggressively in low-lying parts of the Southeast most susceptible to flooding, but in California as well.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to moderating tides and absorbing runoff, wetlands have an uncanny ability to capture carbon in theLiNeBrEaKatmosphere, says David Lewis, executive director of San Francisco's Save the Bay, which is working to restore the sloughs of the Golden Gate.LiNeBrEaKEvery acre of the slough's fast-growing vegetation soaks up 870 kilograms of greenhouse gas annually, roughly equal to the emissions of driving 2,280 miles, according to Lewis.LiNeBrEaK"There's been a lot of talk about replanting forests, but tidal marshes are good, too," he said.LiNeBrEaKBack at Elkhorn Slough, second only to the San Francisco Bay in its expanse of tidal marshland in California, Silberstein says there's no shortage of reasons to expand the wetlands.LiNeBrEaKThe region harbors a diversity of wildlife -- 340 types of birds and 100 fish species -- as well as the groundwater supplies of nearby communities, both of which have been threatened by development.LiNeBrEaKThis month's most visible acquisition is 24. 5 acres at the intersection of Highway 1 and Struve Road. The land was obtained by the state Wildlife Conservation Board for $135,000.LiNeBrEaKElsewhere, 11 acres off Dolan Road were obtained by the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve for $465,000, and a 2. 5-acre conservation easement along Castroville Boulevard was transferred, at no cost, to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation.LiNeBrEaKNone of the new properties in the jointly run preserve are developed.LiNeBrEaKThe parcels join more than 2,500 acres of slough that have been brought under protection during the past seven years.LiNeBrEaKSilberstein says the effort will continue.LiNeBrEaK"The longer we wait, the more it costs and the less there is," he said.LiNeBrEaKContact Kurtis Alexander at 706-3267 or kalexander@santacruzsentinel.com	WETLANDS (91%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); COASTAL AREAS (89%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (89%); ECOSYSTEMS and HABITATS (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); WILDLIFE (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); LAND USE PLANNING (77%); WATER QUALITY (77%); EASEMENTS and RIGHTS OF WAY (72%); REFORESTATION (62%)  		SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA (92%); SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%); EARTH (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 30, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008    	Kurtis Alexander, Santa Cruz Sentinel, Calif.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 30, 2008 Tuesday   FINAL Edition	2008: Year in review;  A look at the Top 10 stories in the Bay Area 	Metro; Pg. B1  	956 words  	It'll start in two days. The calendar pages will flutter from the windows and the bad-mouthing will commence in earnest.LiNeBrEaKEvery year it's the same chorus of good riddance. But 2008 was a special case, even among the recent conglomeration of challenging years. Money, fire, petroleum, water, climate - the news on nearly all fronts was crummy. 2009, nearly here, cannot touch down fast enough. Here are the top 10 local news stories, picked by Chronicle editors and reporters. LiNeBrEaK1. Economic collapse LiNeBrEaKThe delicately balanced house of cards finally toppled over. Suddenly, upstanding borrowers were upside down and half the Central Valley seemed to have a "foreclosed" sign in the front yard. Congress pungled up $700 billion for a bailout and now that seems to be down the rathole, too, along with the average Joe's retirement stash. Brother, everyone seems to be singing, can you spare a dime?LiNeBrEaK2. Same-sex marriageLiNeBrEaKWho would have imagined that the two most controversial words in California would turn out to be "I do"? A long, loud and expensive campaign ended with the narrow passage in November of Proposition 8, writing a ban on same-sex marriage into the state constitution after the California Supreme Court overturned the state's previous ban in May. Months before the election, polls showed the proposition seemed doomed, but a well-funded coalition of conservatives, Catholics, Mormons and others came together to put an end, for now, to the wedding ceremonies seen around the world. Meanwhile, supporters of the marriages have been alternately protesting in the streets and kicking themselves for not working harder before election day.LiNeBrEaK 3. Obama gets out the voteLiNeBrEaKThe election campaign that seemed to last forever finally ended, and the guy who once joked that he did not look like the other people on the money came out on top, winning more votes than any presidential candidate in U.S. history. Enthusiasm for Barack Obama's historic run for president resulted in the highest percentage of California voters casting ballots in 32 years. Usually a campaign slogan means hardly anything, but not in 2008. In three weeks, when for the first time an African American takes the oath of office on Inauguration Day, there will no mistaking the meaning of the word "change." LiNeBrEaK4. Greenhouse gas emissionsLiNeBrEaKCalifornia approved the nation's most sweeping plan to reduce global warming by curbing emissions, a move that state regulators hail as a nationwide model for President-elect Obama. The changes are designed to allow the state to reach its legally mandated goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, a reduction of about 30 percent. They are expected to be put into effect over the next 12 years.LiNeBrEaK5. Record gas pricesLiNeBrEaK2008 proved the price of gasoline is more volatile than gasoline. Over the summer, the stuff cost $4. 50 per gallon. A lot of people discovered they could get by just fine by driving less, walking more, hopping on a bus or pedaling a bike. Then the economy tanked and now the same gallon costs $1. 50. Ridership on public transit has slipped a bit, but it's not clear if lower fuel prices or the rising unemployment rate is to blame.LiNeBrEaK 6. Dry conditions fuel firesLiNeBrEaKFor a while this summer and fall, no part of the state seemed untouched by fire. In November, 1,000 homes were destroyed in a series of devastating blazes in Southern California. Another fire torched 100 homes near Santa Barbara. In October, half of Angel Island went up in smoke. At the beginning of the summer, two dozen homes were lost to a fire in Big Sur, and a huge fire in Butte County barely missed the town of Paradise after forcing 10,000 residents to flee their homes. All told, 1,700 blazes blackened 829,000 acres of California during this year's fire season, keeping firefighters busy. A state of emergency seemed the state's perpetual state.LiNeBrEaK7. Water rationingLiNeBrEaKGasoline and money weren't the only things running out. Two straight years of drought means that California may face water rationing next summer. The causes are complex, but they come down to more people, less rain and fewer smelt - an endangered species protected by strict rules at delta pumping stations. Fish gotta swim.LiNeBrEaK8. S.F. shields immigrant criminalsLiNeBrEaKAfter a Chronicle story described how San Francisco was harboring rather than deporting violent youths, the city shifted gears and changed its decades-old policy of offering sanctuary to undocumented juvenile lawbreakers. The policy, which began in the 1980s as a means of protecting political opponents of regimes in El Salvador and Guatemala, wound up protecting alleged gang killers in the Mission District. Some offenders had been getting free flights to their home countries, with San Francisco taxpayers paying the tab.LiNeBrEaK9. Golden Gate Bridge's anti-suicide netLiNeBrEaKExtra patrols have been dispatched, pleading signs have been erected and crisis hotlines have been installed. Still, more than 1,000 despondent souls have leaped to their deaths from the Golden Gate Bridge. In October, after hearing years of testimony from psychiatrists, social workers and bereaved relatives, bridge directors voted to install a giant $45 million metal net beneath the bridge to catch the leapers. The actual net could be years away while directors try to figure out how to design it and how to pay for it.LiNeBrEaK10. Dellums' job performanceLiNeBrEaKIn Oakland, residents are grumbling more and more fervently about the job performance of freshman Mayor Ron Dellums, the former 13-term U.S. congressman and icon of the left. Critics say his detached manner and ineffectual decision-making - combined with a widely reported spate of strong-arm restaurant robberies and other city problems - have left voters wondering what's going on at City Hall.LiNeBrEaKNo. 2: David Bowers left and Bruce Ivie pause on the second-floor balcony of San Francisco City Hall following their wedding in June, the month after the state Supreme Court overturned a ban on same-sex marriage.

San Gabriel Valley Tribune (California) 	December 30, 2008 Tuesday 	Banned words list announced  	NEWS  	589 words  	DETROIT - A movie about a "maverick," his journey "from Wall Street to Main Street," his "desperate search" for a "monkey" and a "game-changing" revelation about his "carbon footprint" probably would make the nation's word-watchers physically ill. LiNeBrEaKEspecially if it were the "winner of five nominations." LiNeBrEaKAll those words and phrases are on Lake Superior State University's annual List of Words to Be Banished from the Queen's English for Mis-use, Over-use and General Uselessness. The 34th version of the list was released Tuesday, which means, "It's that time of year again."LiNeBrEaKThe school in Michigan's Upper Peninsula selected 15 entries from about 5,000 nominations.LiNeBrEaKDespite the year's economic meltdown (which itself wasn't banished, but don't rule it out for next year), the most entries came from the environmental category - for "green" or "going green."LiNeBrEaK"If I see one more corporation declare itself `green,' I'm going to start burning tires in my backyard," wrote Ed Hardiman of Bristow, Va., in his submission. Nominators also had their fill of "carbon footprint" - the amount of greenhouse gases an individual's lifestyle produces.LiNeBrEaKThe list wasn't overrun with politics despite the national election - no "change," for instance - but one simply couldn't escape the critics' wrath.LiNeBrEaK"I'm a maverick, he's a maverick, wouldn't you like to be a maverick, too?" offered Michael Burke of Silver Spring, Md., in his entry for the label embraced by unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate John McCain.LiNeBrEaKAlso knocked was "first dude," a term adopted by Todd Palin, husband of McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.LiNeBrEaKWords related to the economy led to a few meltdowns.LiNeBrEaK"I am so tired of hearing about everything affecting `Main Street.' I know that with the `Wall Street' collapse, the comparison is convenient, but really, let's find another way to talk about everyman or the middle class, or even, heaven forbid, `Joe the Plumber,' " wrote Stacey from Knoxville, Tenn. She provided only a first name in her bid to eradicate - or at least separate - "Wall Street" and "Main Street."LiNeBrEaKAlthough this year's sluggish economy and record rise in gas prices may have kept people closer to home, the word coined for it, "staycation," is "idiotic and rootless," says Michele Mooney of Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaKAn emoticon made the list for the first time. The strings of characters used in e-mails and text-messaging commonly represent a face - like ;-) or :-0 - but the school singled out an emoticon heart, formed with a "less than" symbol and the number 3.LiNeBrEaK"Monkey" was on the list because of what some see as its rampant use as a suffix: "Especially on the Internet, many people seem to think they can make any boring name sound more attractive just by adding the word `monkey' to it," wrote Rogier Landman of Sommerville, Mass.LiNeBrEaKThe school's annual quest to throw lexicon logs on the fire always gets some end-of-the- year attention for the school in Sault Ste. Marie, the last stop before Michigan's northern border crossing with Canada. But the list is more about letting off steam and offering laughs than performing any verbal vanishing act.LiNeBrEaK"We get several nominations for the same word or phrase, and we still get nominations for words and phrases that have been on previous years' lists," said university spokesman Tom Pink.LiNeBrEaK"`At this point in time' was on the first list in 1976 and it continues to be nominated every year.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	December 30, 2008 Tuesday   FINAL EDITION	Air of confusion  	EDITORIAL; Pg. 012  	645 words  	EDITORIALLiNeBrEaKThe state of New Jersey has taken the lead in the fight against global warming by adopting some of the most aggressive policies in America. Unfortunately, it's hardly leading by example.LiNeBrEaKAs part of the drive to curb carbon emissions, New Jersey has adopted the California Car Standard, which includes strict limits on fuel consumption. The less fuel burned, the less carbon that enters the air.LiNeBrEaKThe standard takes effect Thursday with the start of the new year and calls for all vehicles in the state, public and private, to achieve average fuel economy of 40. 5 miles per gallon by 2016. LiNeBrEaKSo why is the Department of Purchasing accepting bids next week to buy a fleet that includes big SUVs with fuel economy that barely escapes the single digits?LiNeBrEaKThe contract specifications call for the purchase of a number of SUVs in numerous sizes, ranging up to 8,600 pounds in gross vehicle weight with a thirsty 6-liter V-8 engine. State officials argue they need these massive motor vehicles for heavy-duty work. Many private citizens say the same thing. But what sort of vehicle did all these drivers use before the giant SUV was invented? They need to start driving them again if the state is serious about cutting carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKJeff Tittel of the Sierra Club pointed out that when this issue arose last year, environmentalists argued that the state could instead purchase hybrid SUVs, such as the 30-mpg Ford Escape.LiNeBrEaK"On the one hand they say they want to do something about global warming, but then they go out and buy big SUVs," said Tittel.LiNeBrEaKHypocrisy is not the problem, though. The problem is the confused signals sent to elected officials all over New Jersey on the issue of greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKThe minority Republicans in the Legislature last week pointed out another area in which the administration is acting at cross purposes.LiNeBrEaKThe governor has promised to construct more than 100,000 units of affordable housing, and under the rules set by the state Council On Affordable Housing, a substantial number of units must be built in suburban and rural areas. Municipalities are required to submit their affordable housing plans by tomorrow.LiNeBrEaKHowever, on Dec. 15, the administration released a draft Global Warming Response Act Recommendation Report that calls on municipal planning officials to enact zoning that concentrates housing in areas served by mass transit.LiNeBrEaKThe goal, the report says, is that "All New Jerseyans will have alternative transportation options to get to work beyond single occupancy vehicles (SOVs)."LiNeBrEaKOne branch of state government is busy buying giant SUVs. Another branch wants its residents to avoid commuting even in SOVs - presumably even tiny hybrids.LiNeBrEaKSpeaking for the GOP minority, state Sen. Andy Ciesla of Ocean County asked: "How can we reasonably expect local governments to factor zoning recommendations issued by the Corzine administration on Dec. 15 into COAH plans that are due on Dec. 31?"LiNeBrEaKThe state is dodging its duties here. The ultimate power of zoning rests with the state government, as the state Supreme Court noted in the cases that led to the formation of COAH. The court noted that, "In zoning there must be a rational relation between the regulation and the promotion of the general welfare."LiNeBrEaKThe same is true in transportation. If the administration wishes to be a national leader, then state policies should reflect that goal. The state could decide to purchase only hybrid vehicles, for example. And the state could also implement a zoning plan that concentrates housing near mass transit, perhaps with the addition of rail service on new lines such as the Lackawanna Cutoff and the Monmouth-Ocean-Middlesex line.LiNeBrEaKBut if the condition of the North Pole ice caps depends on the administration's current attitude of "Do as I say, not as I do," then a whole lot of polar bears had better start getting ready for a long swim south.

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 	December 30, 2008 Tuesday 	Pool drain regulations among new Minnesota laws  	POLITICS; Legislature; Minnesota-Twin Cities  	399 words  	A faulty swimming pool drain cost 6-year-old Abigail Taylor her life.LiNeBrEaKThe Edina girl was swimming in a kiddie pool at the Minneapolis Golf Club on June 29, 2007, when she got lodged in an open pool drain. The suction resulted in severe internal injuries. She died nine months later. LiNeBrEaKHer death prompted lawmakers to demand safety improvements at Minnesota swimming pools.LiNeBrEaKThe Abigail Taylor Pool Safety Act is one of several state laws to take effect Thursday. It is aimed to protect children and others from the same fate. Other 2009 laws are intended to protect the environment from greenhouse gases and drivers on the road from big rigs.LiNeBrEaKA glimpse of Minnesota's new laws:LiNeBrEaKPool safety: Lawmakers enacted a law for pool drains after Abigail died of injuries caused by a faulty pool drain. Starting Thursday, pools 4 feet deep or less must have anti-entrapment drain covers and other systems to make sure swimmers cannot become trapped by the drain. Also, a certified state-registered engineer must review public pool construction plans. A separate federal law with similar safety enhancements went into effect Dec. 19.LiNeBrEaKTruck safety: A law aims to make drivers more aware of how to share the road with trucks. Under the regulations, driver's education and commercial driver's training will include information on the proper distance for following trucks, the distance needed for trucks to stop, truck blind spots and how to avoid driving in the blind spot.LiNeBrEaKLeaky air conditioners: A law will require automakers to disclose how much air conditioner refrigerant leaks from various makes and models of vehicles. Air conditioner refrigerant is a greenhouse gas, which could contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKAviation insurance claims: A 2003 plane crash in northern Minnesota resulted in a new aviation liability insurance law. Under the law, insurance companies can deny a claim if a pilot's action or inaction has a direct effect on the loss. The changes apply to policies issued, renewed or continued on or after Thursday.LiNeBrEaKHousing law: A law will increase the amount -- from $100,000 to $300,000 -- that contracts for deeds are subject to certain interest rate limits. Under the law, the buyer will receive the deed to the property after the loan is paid. The law also will include penalties and remedies if mortgage brokers do not comply with state regulations.

Birmingham News (Alabama) 	December 29, 2008 Monday 	YOUR OPINIONS  	EDITORIAL; Pg. 6A Vol. 121 No. 291  	1108 words  	Inconceivable responsible adults would favor a new coal mine at allLiNeBrEaK  The story ''ADEM sued over permit to mining company'' (The News, Tuesday) was a head-scratcher. Even in a mining state, it's inconceivable regulators would permit a future coal mine to discharge wastewater near a drinking-water intake. But then again, it's inconceivable that, at this point in history, responsible adults would favor a new coal mine in the first place.LiNeBrEaKI realize there's money to be made, but has anyone involved here heard of global warming? Forget smog, forget mercury, forget degradation of local ecosystems. Coal is a main culprit behind climate change, a problem that may soon make other problems seem insignificant. Promises about the magic of ''clean coal'' - which is a nice PR phrase for something that doesn't exist - don't make me feel better about the future of my child's planet. LiNeBrEaKAnd despite what recent letter writers have ''reasoned,'' record-cold weather does not disprove climate change. Global warming doesn't mean ''every spot on Earth slowly gets warmer.'' It means that, through our chemical altering of the very sky and oceans, a complex climate system is being knocked out of whack. In the coming era of manmade instability, some places will actually get colder as the average temperature of the planet rises. The only things we can predict with any certainty are ''change'' and ''strange.'' Wouldn't it be smarter to slow or stop this worldwide experiment, since we're gambling with everything?LiNeBrEaKDan CarsenLiNeBrEaKBirminghamLiNeBrEaKUnwelcome adviceLiNeBrEaKNewspaper articles and the talk/opinion shows suggest the way out of our economic woes should include national health care.LiNeBrEaKThe suggestions come from all levels of government and industry. I suggest the standards recently set by these groups for themselves are well below the standards Americans should expect from the health care profession.LiNeBrEaKPhysicians who are involved in the level of mismanagement recently exhibited by elected officials, Wall Street, mortgage houses, investment firms and big business would face liability suits and possible loss of license. I think we can forego the advice of government and industry.LiNeBrEaKAllan R. Goldstein, M.D.LiNeBrEaKBirminghamLiNeBrEaKCan't afford sewer rate riseLiNeBrEaKIsn't bankruptcy the best choice for Jefferson County in light of more than $735 million accruing on sewer interest-rate swaps, not counting the original bill?LiNeBrEaKI cannot afford any more increases in my sewer bill, much less any bond deals that are done by those county commissioners. Not only are federal prosecutors indicting some former commissioners, but the current commissioners are ruining the good name of our governor, whom they have dragged into this mess.LiNeBrEaKErvin HughesLiNeBrEaKPinsonLiNeBrEaKDon't put up shoddy decorationsLiNeBrEaKI would like to make a suggestion to Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford regarding the seasonal decorations in the downtown city center area. The Christmas tree and lights in Linn Park this year were probably the most beautiful ever. Nevertheless, as in years past, when one moves one block in any direction from the park, the decorations are deplorable.LiNeBrEaKIt's difficult to determine the reason for the unlit and sparsely installed fixtures throughout the city. There are some with one or two bulbs lit, and others that are totally dark. Wouldn't it be better just to leave the shoddy fixtures in storage rather than have them generate negativity from visitors and residents like me?LiNeBrEaKIn surrounding municipalities, one is greeted with lovely greenery and fresh red bows adorning the street lights. There are no lights on these decorations, but they are certainly pleasant to the eyes of holiday visitors, as well as local citizens.LiNeBrEaKIt isn't difficult for this Birmingham resident to understand why the city continues to lose public school students, families and businesses to our progressive neighboring municipalities.LiNeBrEaKFred BraswellLiNeBrEaKBirminghamLiNeBrEaKGalloway right about Bush legacyLiNeBrEaKI am in complete agreement with the recent Joseph L. Galloway column regarding the performance of the Bush administration (''Good night and good riddance,'' The News, Dec. 20).LiNeBrEaKGalloway is one of America's finest military correspondents, with more than four decades of experience. He served as a specialLiNeBrEaKconsultant to Gen. Colin Powell at the State Department. He supported George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential election. However, Galloway's knowledge of the facts regarding the performance of the Bush administration since the beginning of the Iraq war in 2003 has resulted in his conclusion that the Bush presidency has been one of the worst in the history of the United States.LiNeBrEaKEven in Alabama, it would be a stretch to call Galloway a ''liberal,'' although that term is normally used in a derogatory manner without reference to its accepted definition. Galloway's column simply described matters of record from the past eight years.LiNeBrEaKThe fact is, most historians agree the Bush presidency has been a failure, as Galloway noted. If readers will compare the statements in the Galloway column with the record of the Bush administration, they will find Galloway's conclusions are remarkably accurate.LiNeBrEaKJohn B. BrakeLiNeBrEaKBirminghamLiNeBrEaKLiberal columnists criticized their ownLiNeBrEaKSanta definitely brought me what I wanted for Christmas. I opened to the Other Opinions page on Christmas Day and I read two columns from decidedly liberal writers about liberalism. That would not be too unusual, but both columnists did something very few liberals do: They criticized their own.LiNeBrEaKOne column was from Debra Saunders. In it she outs the gay community for what it truly is: intolerant of anyone who disagrees with them. And this came from a columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle.LiNeBrEaKSaunders did an excellent job telling the unvarnished truth about how the gay rights political scene uses lies and intimidation to try and muzzle anyone who doesn't agree the homosexual lifestyle is equal to the heterosexual lifestyle.LiNeBrEaKThe other column was from New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof about charitable giving. Kristof compared liberals and conservatives and their giving habits.LiNeBrEaKMany of us have known for years that liberals are exceptional at articulating what's wrong with this world, but very lazy at rolling up their collective sleeves and trying to solve the problems. Kristof, like most liberals, was convinced the evidence would clearly show liberals outgave conservatives. But when confronted with the reality of the statistics, he bravely changed his beliefs. Kristof tried to shame liberals into at least meeting the standards conservatives have kept for years.LiNeBrEaKI applaud Saunders and Kristof for their honesty and desire to report the facts.LiNeBrEaKPatricia ParkerLiNeBrEaKOak Mountain	COAL MINING (92%); COAL INDUSTRY (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); NEW MINING PROJECTS (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); MINES and MINING (90%); UTILITY RATES (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (77%); BONDS (76%); PLANETS and ASTEROIDS (75%); SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS (75%); COUNTIES (74%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (73%); FINES and PENALTIES (72%); SMOG (70%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (67%); HEALTH CARE POLICY (67%); INTEREST RATES (65%); ECONOMIC NEWS (65%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (62%); SWAP TRANSACTIONS (60%); DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS (60%); INDICTMENTS (60%); INSOLVENCY and BANKRUPTCY (62%)  		BIRMINGHAM, AL, USA (68%) ALABAMA, USA (92%); EARTH (79%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 31, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Birmingham News All Rights Reserved  										WALL STREET MORTGAGE CORP (52%)

If the project indeed goes forward, then it is still many years, if not a decade or more, before the creation of tens of thousands of jobs. (If economic times are still trying that long out, then that means the either President Hillary Clinton or someone else inherits a long flailing economy.)LiNeBrEaKThe high-speed rail project will do little to alleviate our most critical transportation needs: the local congestion we all face day to day. Our metropolitan areas require clean and timely transportation for the daily commute (something of the quality of the Tokyo subway/rail system, for example). We need better commute options to get from Fremont to Mountain View or from Berkeley to Redwood City.LiNeBrEaKAlso, any high-speed rail project will likely be burdened with patronage-filled positions and contracts. California deserves a wiser solution to its transportation needs.LiNeBrEaKDan TracyLiNeBrEaKFremont	LETTERS and COMMENTS (92%); TAXES and TAXATION (90%); POLITICAL PARTIES (90%); SOCIAL SECURITY (90%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (90%); TAX LAW (90%); US PRESIDENTS (90%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); MUSIC (89%); LEGISLATORS (89%); WIND INSTRUMENTS (86%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (78%); DEREGULATION (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); BUDGET (77%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (76%); OUTSOURCING (76%); OIL and GAS INCENTIVES (76%); ENERGY REGULATION (76%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (73%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (72%); THEATER (71%); ENERGY and UTILITY DEREGULATION (71%); WAGES and SALARIES (71%); ARTISTS and PERFORMERS (71%); CIVIL RIGHTS (70%); CHRISTMAS (70%); MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS (70%); GLOBAL WARMING (69%); MOTOR VEHICLES (68%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (68%); MUSIC INDUSTRY (65%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (64%); RANKINGS (60%); INSURANCE (56%); SINGERS and MUSICIANS (70%)  	GEORGE W BUSH (91%)  	SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (93%); SACRAMENTO, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (93%); MISSISSIPPI, USA (79%); LOUISIANA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 26, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved  	Letters from our readers  																					
Contra Costa Times (California) 	December 29, 2008 Monday 	George F. Will: Federal government now permeates the economy with politics  	OPINION  	797 words  	IN 1966, THE price of eggs rose to a level that President Lyndon Johnson judged, God knows how, was too high. There were two culprits   supply and demand   and Johnson's agriculture secretary told him there was not much that could be done. LBJ, however, was a can-do fellow who directed the U.S. surgeon general to dampen demand by warning the nation about the hazards of cholesterol in eggs.LiNeBrEaKJohnson, the last president with a direct political connection to Franklin Roosevelt, was picked by FDR in 1935 to be Texas director of the New Deal's National Youth Administration. Two years later, Johnson came to Congress, a rung on the ladder that led to glory as Egg Czar. Today, with Washington experiencing a Roosevelt revival, Johnson's spirit, too, goes marching on as the federal government permeates the economy with politics. LiNeBrEaKOr not. In an interview with Business Week, Rep. Barney Frank, the effervescent Massachusetts Democrat who chairs the Financial Services Committee, was asked, concerning the auto industry, "How do you make sure the government doesn't meddle too deeply in day-to-day operations and bring politics   like a push for green cars   into the equation?" Frank replied: "Oh, well, a push for green cars is very much a part of what we're involved in. We don't think that's politics." So, when the government, its 10 thumbs stuck deep in the economy, uses its power to compel an industry to pursue the objectives of the political party that controls both of the government's political branches, that is not politics.LiNeBrEaKBusiness Week: "Should GM acquire Chrysler?"

Frank's humility is selective: He obviously thinks he is competent to say what kind of cars should be made.LiNeBrEaKBusiness Week: "Does Congress realize how few hybrids have been sold, as it pushes Detroit to make them, and will Congress give consumers greater incentives to buy these cars?" Frank: Those who are "blaming the auto companies forget to blame somebody else   the consumers. In the recorded history of America, no one was ever forced at gunpoint to buy a Hummer. But we do believe that the combination of genuine concern about global warming and energy efficiency means people are now ready to buy these cars." Consumers are such a disappointment to Congress. But what Congress really believes is that people are not ready to buy those cars at a price that reflects the costs of making them. Why else has it voted tax subsidies for buyers?LiNeBrEaKForty years ago, Vietnam was a disaster and the Great Society was a disappointment as Johnson limped back to Texas. Today, there is more Johnsonian confidence in government's competence than at any time since Johnson's policies shattered such confidence. The resurgence of confidence began under today's Texan president.LiNeBrEaKThe 1996 Republican platform said: "The federal government has no constitutional authority to be involved in school curricula. ... That is why we will abolish the Department of Education (and) end federal meddling in our schools."

The Johnsonian attributes of NCLB, which Hess says include "Great Society-style ambition and race-conscious rhetoric," suggest that the Egg Czar, who also was the first National School Superintendent, would feel right at home in a Washington where he could be Automotive Engineer in Chief.

Contra Costa Times (California) 	December 29, 2008 Monday 	George F. Will: Federal government now permeates the economy with politics  	OPINION  	797 words  	IN 1966, THE price of eggs rose to a level that President Lyndon Johnson judged, God knows how, was too high. There were two culprits   supply and demand   and Johnson's agriculture secretary told him there was not much that could be done. LBJ, however, was a can-do fellow who directed the U.S. surgeon general to dampen demand by warning the nation about the hazards of cholesterol in eggs.LiNeBrEaKJohnson, the last president with a direct political connection to Franklin Roosevelt, was picked by FDR in 1935 to be Texas director of the New Deal's National Youth Administration. Two years later, Johnson came to Congress, a rung on the ladder that led to glory as Egg Czar. Today, with Washington experiencing a Roosevelt revival, Johnson's spirit, too, goes marching on as the federal government permeates the economy with politics. LiNeBrEaKOr not. In an interview with Business Week, Rep. Barney Frank, the effervescent Massachusetts Democrat who chairs the Financial Services Committee, was asked, concerning the auto industry, "How do you make sure the government doesn't meddle too deeply in day-to-day operations and bring politics   like a push for green cars   into the equation?" Frank replied: "Oh, well, a push for green cars is very much a part of what we're involved in. We don't think that's politics." So, when the government, its 10 thumbs stuck deep in the economy, uses its power to compel an industry to pursue the objectives of the political party that controls both of the government's political branches, that is not politics.LiNeBrEaKBusiness Week: "Should GM acquire Chrysler?" Frank: "I'm not competent to say." Frank's humility is selective: He obviously thinks he is competent to say what kind of cars should be made.LiNeBrEaKBusiness Week: "Does Congress realize how few hybrids have been sold, as it pushes Detroit to make them, and will Congress give consumers greater incentives to buy these cars?"

The Decatur Daily (Alabama)  	December 29, 2008 Monday 	EDITORIAL: Obama's choice of Rick Warren is a good one  	COMMENTARY  	354 words  	Dec. 29--The Rev. Rick Warren, a prominent evangelical author and pastor, will give the invocation at Barack Obama's presidential inauguration -- which has upset gay-rights activists. LiNeBrEaKMr. Warren wrote a best-selling book, "The Purpose-Driven Life," among other works. Many churches in North Alabama have used his books for organized studies.LiNeBrEaKHe takes traditional, Bible-based Christian views on homosexuality, and he came out in favor of a California ballot initiative against gay marriage. Gay-marriage proponents considered its passage a setback on the same day that the nation took a leap forward by electing the first black president.LiNeBrEaKBut Mr. Warren is not a knee-jerk conservative or a Republican activist, unlike some of his evangelical brethren. He has called for Christians to act against poverty, disease, illiteracy and global warming.LiNeBrEaKHe probably disagrees with the president-elect on several issues.LiNeBrEaKIt would be absurd to expect two thinking individuals to agree on everything, and these two men have different backgrounds. Mr. Obama undoubtedly is more liberal.LiNeBrEaKBut by inviting Mr. Warren to pray, Mr. Obama extends a hand to millions of Americans who respect the pastor and largely agree with him. Mr. Obama is building some goodwill that he can use as he leads the nation.LiNeBrEaKThis is yet another sign that the president-elect wants to avoid divisive politics and bring the country together around goals we can agree on.LiNeBrEaKThere will still be disagreements on gay rights and other issues -- "we are diverse and noisy and opinionated," as Mr. Obama said -- but let's hope that people will listen to one another.LiNeBrEaKIt will be interesting to hear Mr. Warren's prayer. We'd expect it to be inclusive and constructive.

The Fresno Bee (California)  	December 29, 2008 Monday 	The Fresno Bee, Calif., Marek Warszawski column: Of Fresno, failure and Falcons too  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	537 words  	Dec. 29--Enter the Warzone, ringing in the New Year with a few jabs.LiNeBrEaKNice of Fresno Falcons co-owner Brian Glover to inform us the de-iced hockey team lost more than $4 million during the past three years. Would have been nicer had he spoken up 13 months ago before the city spent $5 million to upgrade Selland Arena.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps Glover figured those improvements were meant for the Ice Capades. LiNeBrEaKNot sure if this was a joke or an oversight, but the mass e-mail sent out by Falcons CEO John Tull announcing the team had ceased operations included this phrase near the bottom: FRESNO FALCONS SEASON TICKETS STILL ON SALE!LiNeBrEaKGet 'em while they're hot.LiNeBrEaKWhich of these events has a greater chance of taking place in 2009?LiNeBrEaKThe Falcons return to the ECHL under new ownership or Pat Hill changes his offensive philosophy.LiNeBrEaKWe'll take neither for $800, Alex.LiNeBrEaKDon't mean to imply that Fresno State's football coach is inflexible, but we've seen plaster walls with more give.LiNeBrEaKWe've heard the publishers of Webster's New World Dictionary are adding a new verb -- gartrell -- to their next edition.LiNeBrEaKIt means "to run over, around or through your opponent while encountering little or no resistance."LiNeBrEaKGartrell Johnson's 285 rushing yards against Fresno State in the New Mexico Bowl reminds us of Utah's Mike Anderson gashing the Bulldogs for 254 yards in the 1999 Las Vegas Bowl.LiNeBrEaKAfter that game, Hill challenged his defense to become "more physical" during the offseason. Sounds like good advice even now.LiNeBrEaKBecause both are extremely large and ... um, lack quickness, Fresno State big man Brandon Webster earned the nickname "Glacier" last season from certain members of the media. (One in particular.) Now add global warming to the list of shared attributes. Our man has dropped a few pounds.LiNeBrEaKFor fans wishing talented freshman Paul George would assert himself more offensively, look at it this way: If George did that, he wouldn't be here as a sophomore.LiNeBrEaKFor no apparent reason: Andrea Bona.LiNeBrEaKThe New York Yankees signed slugging first baseman Mark Teixeira to a $180 million contract.

The Hays Daily News (Kansas)  	December 29, 2008 Monday 	Fate of lesser prairie chickens tied to habitat  	LIFESTYLE  	933 words  	Dec. 29--The plight of the lesser prairie chicken is almost more about environmental pressures bearing down on the birds than about the birds themselves.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service earlier this month updated its list of candidate species eligible for protection under the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaKThe status of the lesser prairie chicken was upgraded from an 8 to a 2. LiNeBrEaKWhile that might only be a single step, according to Randy Rodgers, the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Park's upland bird biologist, it is significant.LiNeBrEaK"At (step) 2, they are one step away from being listed," he said.LiNeBrEaKKansas has two species of prairie chickens, the greater and the lesser. Lesser prairie chickens are generally in an area of southwest and west-central Kansas, while greater prairie chickens are best known in the Flint Hills.LiNeBrEaKThe lesser prairie chicken's range is restricted to five states -- Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma.LiNeBrEaKIn moving the lesser prairie chicken a step closer to placement on the endangered species list, biologists at the federal level said occupied range has declined about 92 percent since the 1800s.LiNeBrEaKThe greatest threat now is the "destruction, modification and curtailment of its habitat and range, the FWS findings determined.LiNeBrEaKA booming oil and gas economy, wind energy development and the potential loss of land currently enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program are the birds greatest threats.LiNeBrEaKThe specter of climate change, Rodgers said, could be a huge factor.LiNeBrEaKKansas can lay claim to the greatest concentration of lesser prairie chickens.LiNeBrEaK"We have roughly half the lesser prairie chickens in the world in the state of Kansas," Rodgers said.LiNeBrEaKBut wind resources have prompted a huge crush of developers hoping to build wind farms in the western half of the state, not to mention the push for new oil and gas wells.LiNeBrEaKThese are not new issues, Rodgers said, but there is a new urgency, brought on by what had been skyrocketing fuel costs.LiNeBrEaKIn New Mexico, he said, the pressure is oil and gas development. There, they also have encroachment of mesquite trees, rather than the eastern red cedar problems that have been documented in Kansas.LiNeBrEaKTexas, he said, is flush with wind and oil and gas development.LiNeBrEaK"Wind power developers seemingly are everywhere," Rodgers said, even in Kansas. "This is almost equal to the wildcat days of the oil boom."LiNeBrEaKWhile wind is ecologically sound, there is a down side to the construction of towers in native prairies where the lesser prairie chickens live and breed.LiNeBrEaKStudies have shown that prairie chickens avoid nesting in areas where human development exists, or where there are tall structures -- perhaps seen as perches for birds of prey.LiNeBrEaKAlong roads, for example, prairie chickens avoid nesting within 100 yards. Chickens set back from powerlines by as much as a quarter mile when nesting. Around large buildings, such as the Holcomb Power Plant operated by Sunflower Electric, prairie chickens avoid nesting within a mile of the facility.LiNeBrEaKAlthough commercial wind farms might have a small footprint as far as towers are concerned, the height and movement of the blades might keep prairie chickens out of the entire region.LiNeBrEaKAt the Tradewinds Wind Farm in Ellsworth and Lincoln counties, for example, the footprint of the turbines might only be a few hundred acres. But the 26,000-acre prairie that the farm covers might effectively be off limits as far as nesting is concerned for prairie chickens.LiNeBrEaK"Our population (of prairie chickens) has done reasonable well," Rodgers said, notably since the late '90s when large tracts of land were enrolled in the popular CRP.LiNeBrEaKBut a significant portion of that ground will be eligible for release in coming years, he said. If that happens, that would not be good for the birds.LiNeBrEaKOf the five states with lesser prairie chickens, only Kansas and Texas have hunting seasons.LiNeBrEaKThe season in Kansas, Rodgers said, is "very restrictive."LiNeBrEaKHunters kill anywhere from 200 to 500 lesser prairie chickens each year.LiNeBrEaKThat's less than 1 percent of the total population.LiNeBrEaKKansas has an estimated breeding population of anywhere from 14,000 to 21,000 birds.LiNeBrEaK"That does not equal fall numbers," Rodgers said, the time when hunting is allowed. Most years, the population is at least 50 percent higher in the fall, he said, and sometimes twice the spring breeding population.LiNeBrEaK"Hunting has played no factor whatsoever in the decline of this species," he said.LiNeBrEaKThat's part of the reason why a hunting season remains.LiNeBrEaK"We have maintained a hunting season in part to send a message that sport hunting does not play a role in the decline," he said.LiNeBrEaKDoing away with the season, he said, "sends the wrong message. If we change the season, it sends a message that hunting matters."LiNeBrEaKThe problem, he contends, falls to habitat.LiNeBrEaK"People should understand that 90 percent of this species habitat is almost gone," Rodgers said. "Its possible to compromise a species right into oblivion and we don't want to see that happen."LiNeBrEaKRodgers is also aware that lesser prairie chickens are a flagship species, "flashy" animals that attract attention.LiNeBrEaK"The habitat that supports this species supports a lot of other species that are in long-term decline."

Hendricks County Flyer (Avon, Indiana)  	December 29, 2008 Monday 	High temperatures break record  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	477 words  	Dec. 29--Although the weather was foggy and wet on Saturday, the National Weather Service of Indianapolis saw temperatures rise to a record high.LiNeBrEaKMike Koch, meteorologist for the NWS, said temperatures in Hendricks County rose up to 68 degrees on Saturday, just barely breaking a previous record of 67 degrees. LiNeBrEaK"Although it only got up to the lower 40s on Sunday, the temperature was still above normal," Koch said. "Monday reached 48 degrees, which is well above normal as well."LiNeBrEaKThe increase in temperatures within the past week are abnormal, but Koch says there is no reason to blame it on global warming.LiNeBrEaK"To prove something like that is beyond the scope," he said. "You would have to look at previous years and other specific measurements and not just one storm system. Even if you did specific measurements and other factors, there is no way to tell if the warmer temperatures are an effect of global warming."LiNeBrEaKWith the warm front, came wet and foggy conditions. Koch said the amount of precipitation is above the normal amount for this time of year by 8. 33 inches.LiNeBrEaK"We had pretty strong storms move through Saturday evening and had quite a bit of rain in some areas," he said. "Some areas received two inches of rain."LiNeBrEaKAt this time last year, Hendricks County had received 4. 256 inches below the normal amount of rainfall.LiNeBrEaK"The rivers and creeks are a bit high in the area, but we haven't received bad reports of flooding," Koch said. "On the other hand, the Wabash River is above flood stage, which means the water is coming out of its bank and flooding low land areas near the river. At this point, it's just affecting north of us."LiNeBrEaKWinter temperatures force the ground to freeze and because the ground is frozen, it cannot hold much water, causing the water to sit on the surface and flood, Koch explained.LiNeBrEaKLast week Hendricks County saw very low temperatures combined with below zero wind chills. This week, the temperatures reached a record high. But Koch said he is rarely surprised with Indiana's weather.LiNeBrEaK"It's wintertime," he said. "Temperatures can go up and down between fall and spring across Indiana and as weather systems move quickly, it causes quite a change in temperatures."LiNeBrEaKThe warm weather won't stick around for long. Today and Wednesday should be in the high 30s and should remain dry. There is a 30 percent chance of snow on Thursday as a low pressure cold front moves into Central Indiana.LiNeBrEaKandrea.hirsch@flyergroup.com	WEATHER (91%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); METEOROLOGY (90%); FLOODS and FLOODING (89%); RIVERS (69%)  		INDIANAPOLIS, IN, USA (88%) INDIANA, USA (91%) UNITED STATES (91%)  	December 30, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008    	Andrea Hirsch, Hendricks County Flyer, Avon, Ind.

The Houston Chronicle (Texas)  	December 29, 2008 Monday 	Texas Legislature could be going 'green': Priorities in upcoming session may include renewable energy, environmental jobs  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	733 words  	Dec. 29--Global warming might be critical to the future of the planet, but inside the Texas Capitol, it's never been much of a match for taxes and tuition.LiNeBrEaKThe upcoming legislative session, however, could be different, with lawmakers from both parties already talking about renewable energy, energy efficiency and so-called "green jobs" as priorities.LiNeBrEaK"The climate has changed, atmospherically and politically," said Tom "Smitty" Smith, executive director of the Texas office for Public Citizen, a consumer and environmental advocacy group. LiNeBrEaKFor some time now, Texas lawmakers have been cool to global warming, spurning several measures that dealt directly with the issue. The state is America's power plant and gas pump and thus leads the nation, by far, in emissions of heat-trapping gases that contribute to climate change.LiNeBrEaKBut with a new president who has pledged to cap carbon dioxide emissions and invest in renewable energy, lawmakers and lobbyists expect Washington to move aggressively to combat climate change.LiNeBrEaKChances are Texas lawmakers will continue a wait-and-see approach on rules regulating emissions, focusing instead on financial carrots, in part because of concerns over the slumping economy.LiNeBrEaKWhat is emerging is an environmental agenda that could provide incentives for large-scale solar-energy projects, set goals for reducing utilities' energy consumption and promote efficiency through new building codes.LiNeBrEaKHeat-trapping gases are tied to energy use because the process of burning fossil fuels emits carbon dioxide. So, any measure to conserve energy can indirectly cut greenhouse emissions.LiNeBrEaK"There is a lot of momentum on renewable energy and energy efficiency," said Ken Kramer, director of the Sierra Club's Lone Star chapter. "That's where we're putting emphasis."LiNeBrEaKThe approach, in some ways, is through a side door because the declared intent isn't to control global warming. The Republican-controlled Legislature historically hasn't supported tough environmental rules but has embraced renewable energy because of the economic opportunity.LiNeBrEaKTexas now has more electrical generating capacity from wind turbines than any other state, including California, which is generally seen in a greener tint. California recently adopted the nation's first comprehensive plan to slash heat-trapping emissions, with a goal to cut them by 15 percent over the next 12 years.LiNeBrEaKState Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat, has once again filed a bill that is patterned after the California law that led to the climate-change plan.LiNeBrEaKHis bill is intended to achieve "the maximum feasible and cost-effective reductions" of heat-trapping gas emissions by 2023, using a market-based strategy and better monitoring and reporting programs.LiNeBrEaKBut the bill has little chance of passage, legislative aides and lobbyists said.LiNeBrEaK"There isn't the political will or need to address this," said Steve McMillen, an Austin-based environmental attorney for Baker Botts, which represents coal-fired utilities, petrochemical plants and refineries.LiNeBrEaKGov. Rick Perry, for one, has said federal regulation of carbon-dioxide emissions would be economically disastrous to Texas. Such rules could disproportionately harm the state because of its concentration of refineries, chemical plants and coal-burning power plants, he said during a news conference last month.LiNeBrEaK"We would rather find ways to unleash our economy than strangle it," Perry said.LiNeBrEaKThe governor's Texas Advisory Panel on Federal Environmental Regulation also called for regulatory restraint because "recent climate research calls into question prevailing public perceptions of the cause and extent of global warming."LiNeBrEaKThe position troubles some environmentalists who believe it puts Texas at a disadvantage as other states and countries shape policy.LiNeBrEaK"It's sad that (Texas lawmakers) are still having the debates no one else is having," said Matthew Tejada, executive director of the Galveston-Houston Association for Smog Prevention.LiNeBrEaKmatthew.tresaugue@chron.com	EMISSIONS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); SOLAR ENERGY (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (90%); LEGISLATORS (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); POWER PLANTS (89%); WIND POWER PLANTS (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (89%); LOBBYING (89%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (89%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (88%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); OIL and GAS CONSUMPTION (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (78%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (77%); WIND ENERGY (77%); CONSUMPTION (75%); SOLAR POWER PLANTS (69%)  		HOUSTON, TX, USA (73%) TEXAS, USA (97%); CALIFORNIA, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	December 29, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Houston Chronicle   	Matthew Tresaugue, Houston Chronicle  	PUBLIC CITIZEN (57%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	Government  	20081229-HO-Texas-Legislature-could-be-going-green-1229  	HO  														
The Houston Chronicle 	December 29, 2008 Monday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Frigid fundraising heats up  	A; Pg. 2  	273 words  	The Lobster Dip was launched 21 years ago as Maine's first happening where people could raise money for a good cause by stripping down in the freezing winter air and running half-naked into the bone-chilling ocean. LiNeBrEaKThese days, it seems as if everybody's taking the plunge, and that's threatening to saturate the fundraising field.LiNeBrEaKRocky Frenzilli helped organize the original Lobster Dip to benefit Special Olympics Maine and has seen it grow from about 15 participants to more than 300 each New Year's Day at Old Orchard Beach. Since that first Dip, he has greeted each new year with an icy splash.LiNeBrEaKSome people call him crazy, but he says it's his way of giving back to the community.LiNeBrEaK"As long as I'm physically able to jump in the water, I'll continue doing it," said Frenzilli, 60, a high school teacher. "It makes you feel real warm inside when you're doing something special for other people."LiNeBrEaKHowever, the growing number of such events and the limited number of people crazy enough to jump unprotected into icy water is raising questions about whether these polar plunges are cutting into one another's fundraising.LiNeBrEaK"My concern is we haven't been able to grow our event beyond the point that it's gotten to, maybe because of the competition of other plunges around the state," said Phil Geelhoed, president and CEO of Special Olympics Maine.LiNeBrEaKThe Natural Resources Council of Maine environmental group is holding its first polar swim fundraiser Friday to raise money for its work on global warming issues.LiNeBrEaKCouncil spokeswoman Judy Berk isn't worried that there are too many polar plunges.LiNeBrEaK"I think there are enough people to go around," she said.

Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (Ontario, CA) 	December 29, 2008 Monday 	Thinning California's forests reduces wildfire disasters  	OPINION  	758 words  	The impact of California's wildfires on climate and forests is one of the most important issues of our time. This is a new era with a new federal administration, a new Congress, a new political and economic landscape, and new opportunities.LiNeBrEaKThe fact is that the wildfire crisis is becoming more serious each year. LiNeBrEaKFires are getting bigger, more destructive, and more expensive. In 2001, California wildfires burned one-half million acres. Over 1 million acres burned in 2007 and again in 2008, the worst fire year in the state's history. Next year could be even worse.LiNeBrEaKFrom 2001 to 2007, fires burned a total of more than 4 million acres and released an estimated 277 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from combustion and the post-fire decay of dead trees. That is an average of 68 tons per acre.LiNeBrEaKThese wildfires kill wildlife, pollute the air and water, and the greenhouse gases they emit are wiping out much of what is being achieved to reduce emissions from fossil fuels to battle global warming.LiNeBrEaKThese emissions are equivalent to adding an estimated 50 million more cars onto California's highways for one year, each spewing tons of greenhouse gases. Stated another way, this means all 14 million cars in California would have to be locked in a garage for 3 1/and2 years to make up for the global warming impact of these wildfires.LiNeBrEaKThe catastrophic and unnatural forest fires that ravage California each year do not resemble historic fires. Frequent lightning and Indian-set fires that burned along the ground, igniting only scattered small groups of trees, kept forests open and healthy, and resistant to catastrophic fires.LiNeBrEaKEven chaparral fires in the vast brushlands of Southern California were limited in extent in past centuries. Frequent fires sustained a mosaic in which old flammable chaparral was isolated between patches of less flammable young chaparral, which kept wildfires from spreading across the landscape, regardless of strong winds.LiNeBrEaKAn industrialized and modern world cannot live with the annual recurrence of unnatural catastrophic wildfires. That is not realistic or acceptable. The only solution is to protect our communities, forests, and climate by reducing the threat of wildfires. That means not just fighting fires but taking action to reduce fuels to prevent fires.LiNeBrEaKThere is no question that thinning large and small trees is effective in helping prevent crown fires, as documented in two California wildfires - the Cone Fire in 2002 and the Bell Fire in 2005 - when they dropped to the ground and became easily suppressed surface fires after entering thinned forests.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent fighting wildfires each year and very little is spent on fuel reduction. It is no wonder that wildfires are getting bigger and more destructive since forests keep growing thicker and fuel piles up.LiNeBrEaKSome California forests have more than 1,000 trees per acre when 40 to 60 trees per acre would be natural. These dense forests contain small trees that can carry fire into the canopy, and heavy concentrations of woody debris on the ground that intensify the flames. This combination of too many large trees intermixed with small trees and surface debris are responsible for the size and severity of forest fires.LiNeBrEaKThis is only part of the wildfire tragedy. Wildfires are causing California's forests to dwindle and the greenhouse gases they emit will stay in the atmosphere for centuries. This means that the estimated 134 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) released by fires and the decay of dead trees from forests that were permanently converted to brush will continue to worsen global warming. LiNeBrEaKHarvesting dead trees, storing the carbon they contain in wood products, and planting a young forest that absorbs CO2 through photosynthesis is the only way to recover this greenhouse gas from deforested areas. The immensity of greenhouse gas emissions from California's wildfires and the permanent loss of huge areas of forest are a warning.LiNeBrEaKIf we take these steps, we can restore the natural health and diversity of our forests, help the fight to reduce harmful emissions, and leave a legacy of which we can be proud.LiNeBrEaKThomas Bonnicksen is professor meritus of forestry at Texas AandM University, visiting scholar with The Forest Foundation, research scholar in residence at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and author of "America's Ancient Forests."

The Knoxville News-Sentinel (Tennessee)  	December 29, 2008 Monday 	Oak Ridge National Laboratory staff keeps growing  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	475 words  	Dec. 29--OAK RIDGE -- Oak Ridge National Laboratory may not be recession-proof, but it has continued to hire during difficult economic times.LiNeBrEaKIn 2008, ORNL followed a trend of recent years and hired about 400 new staff members. Part of the reason is to replace the growing number of retirees at the federal laboratory. However, according to statistics provided by UT-Battelle, the government's managing contractor at ORNL, the lab's overall employment continued to rise as well. LiNeBrEaKORNL currently has about 4,420 full-time staff members. That's up by about 100 from 2007 and up by more than 600 since 2002.LiNeBrEaKBilly Stair, the lab's communications director, said he believes there's a chain reaction going on.LiNeBrEaK"By modernizing the laboratory we attracted world-class scientists, who in turn put ORNL in a stronger position to compete with other labs for new research programs," Stair said.LiNeBrEaKThe newest research centers at the lab are among the growth areas, he said.LiNeBrEaKThe National Center for Computational Sciences, which boasts the second-fastest computer in the world (Jaguar) and a number of other high-performance supercomputers, currently employs 449 people. That's up from 268 four years ago, when ORNL won a Department of Energy competition that led to the arrival of Jaguar -- a Cray XT5 system that's used for modeling global climate change and other scientific challenges.LiNeBrEaKAnother employment magnet is the Spallation Neutron Source, a $1. 6 billion experimental facility that began research operations in April 2006. The SNS has 482 staff members.LiNeBrEaKStair said ORNL officials are hopeful that the employment trend will continue in 2009, although there are many uncertainties with the change of administrations in Washington. The ORNL spokesman said "early indications" are that alternative energy and climate will be high priorities at the Department of Energy, and he said both are areas of strength at the Oak Ridge lab.LiNeBrEaKRegardless of whether there is growth, ORNL apparently will need to continue hiring because of the high retirement rate.

The Manila Times (Philippines)  	December 29, 2008 Monday 	Government to step up energy conservation program next year  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	477 words  	Dec. 29--The Energy department reported that government is eyeing energy savings of 160 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and six million liters of fuel in 2009. The targeted reduction in energy consumption would translate to about P1. 50 billion in cumulative monetary savings for the government. LiNeBrEaKBased on energy consumption reports submitted by government agencies including its attached agencies and bureaus in the National Capital Region and other regional offices, the figures are substantially higher than the combined targets of government in the past four years.LiNeBrEaKThe Energy department said that from September 2005 to November 2008, the government was able to generate only P1. 20 billion in energy savings.LiNeBrEaKThis was a result of reduced electricity and fuel consumption by about 131. 19 million kilowatt-hours and 4. 78 million liters, respectively.LiNeBrEaKThe private sector, on the other hand, was able to realize savings of P2. 7 billion from energy reductions equivalent to 84. 90 million liters of oil equivalent this year.LiNeBrEaKFor 2009, the Department of Energy report said that the government targets total energy savings worth P3. 20 billion from reduced consumption of 100 million liters of oil equivalent for the private sector.LiNeBrEaKAmong the projects the Energy department has lined up for next year to jumpstart the country's energy conservation campaign is the phase out of incandescent bulbs (IBs) in the country in lieu of compact fluorescent lamps, which it plans to accomplish in the next two years.LiNeBrEaKA Philippine National Standard study found that the compact fluorescent lamps last five times longer and uses 80-percent less energy than equivalent incandescent bulbs.LiNeBrEaKDepartment of Energy Secretary Angelo Reyes had said "the calibrated phase-out of IBs would be made within two years in order to achieve reduction in the national energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission as a response to rising oil prices and adverse effects of climate change."LiNeBrEaKThe Energy department said that the benefits of converting an estimated 7. 80 million households in the country still using IBs include $300. 00 million in savings each year from displaced oil imports; $200 billion in avoided generation of 2,000 megawatts during peak hours, which is enough to meet the 700 megawatts additional capacity needed each year for the next three years $500 million in savings for consumers each year and 2. 50 million tons of prevented greenhouse gas emissions each year.

The New York Times 	December 29, 2008 Monday   Late Edition - Final	Balmy Day Is a Breath Of Spring  	Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 20  	508 words  	''Thank goodness for global warming,'' Barry London, 35, joked on Sunday after planting himself on the sidewalk in front of Secret Project Robot, an art space in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Mr. London was stretched out on a bright green lawn chair that his friend Rachel Nelson had bought for $5. 99. LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Nelson, 28, was sitting on a bench nearby, along with Kitty Cat, a skittish black cat. It was shortly after noon and temperatures were higher outside than inside Secret Project Robot, where the furnace had died.LiNeBrEaK  ''It's really, really bizarre,'' Mr. London, who runs a recording studio, said of the weather.LiNeBrEaK  ''But it's sort of nice,'' said Ms. Nelson, who works in the art space.LiNeBrEaK  Indeed, the break in the cold offered New Yorkers a welcome respite. By late afternoon, the temperature had hit 65 degrees, matching the record high for the date in 1982, according to the Weather Underground, an online service. It was almost like  spring for a day.LiNeBrEaK  Around the corner from Secret Project Robot, people drifted to Grand Ferry Park, a  flyspeck of a waterfront space with views of the Williamsburg Bridge and the Manhattan skyline. Among the parkgoers were Billy Scafuri, who is 27 and a comedian, and Marina Michelson, a 22-year-old actress.  Sunday's relative balminess caught the couple, and many others in New York, unawares.LiNeBrEaK  ''The first thing I said when I got up was, 'Can we go to the park?' '' said Ms. Michelson, who lives nearby. LiNeBrEaK  ''And I said, 'No,' '' Mr. Scafuri said. But after checking the weather online, the pair set off,  settling on a bench not far from the water's edge.LiNeBrEaK  ''One of the best views of Manhattan,'' Mr. Scafuri mused.LiNeBrEaK  Bird watchers welcomed the warm weather, too, among them Dennis Edge, positioned at the southern end of Tompkins Square Park in the East Village.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Edge was peering through a Canon camera outfitted with a long lens. He spotted a small brown bird with yellow markings on a leafless tree limb. It was, Mr. Edge believed, a pine siskin.LiNeBrEaK  ''I go out even on bad days, cold days, snowy days,'' Mr. Edge said. ''But this is better. The birds are more active, and it is less uncomfortable for me.''LiNeBrEaK  The unseasonable warmth was not good news for everyone.LiNeBrEaK  At a municipal tennis court in East River Park in Manhattan, two 18-year-old Brooklyn residents, Sammy Chea of Marine Park and David Wang of Park Slope, wore  T-shirts as they darted and volleyed balls over a net -- or tried to.  Puddles on the court caused the tennis balls to become waterlogged.LiNeBrEaK  ''These balls are very hard and heavy to hit,'' Mr. Chea said. LiNeBrEaK  Gardeners, for their part, enjoyed the chance to dig in unfrozen ground, even if the temperatures caused some flowers to sprout prematurely. At the Lower East Side Ecology Center Garden, a community garden on East Seventh Street,  Christine Datz-Romero, a garden member, was reburying daffodil bulbs,  she said, so they would survive the lower temperatures expected later in the week.LiNeBrEaK  ''Not yet,'' Ms. Datz-Romero said,  as she gently covered each  bulb with soil.

The New York Times 	December 29, 2008 Monday   Late Edition - Final	Bjork ... Venture Capitalist?  	Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; BITS; Pg. 5  	312 words  	Bjork ... Venture Capitalist?LiNeBrEaK  Bjork -- the Icelandic singer famous for her eclectic music, provocative music videos and outlandish fashion sense (even if you don't know her music, you probably know her swan dress at the 2001 Oscars) -- is adding ''venture capitalist'' to her resume. LiNeBrEaK  Audur Capital, a venture capital firm in Reykjavik, Iceland, has started its second fund, named Bjork, with 100 million Icelandic kronur (about $809,000) from Bjork and the firm. They are raising more money now, with the goal of closing the fund in March.LiNeBrEaK  The Bjork fund will invest in early stage businesses concentrating on green technology, with the goal of helping spur a recovery of Iceland's economy, which was devastated by a financial crisis this fall.LiNeBrEaK  ''The fund will invest in sustainable businesses that create value through leveraging Iceland's unique resources, spectacular nature, vibrant culture and green energy,'' according to Audur's Web site.LiNeBrEaK  Bjork has sung about politics, feminism and environmentalism. But lately, she has used her music -- and her money -- to address climate change and Iceland's economic crisis. She released a new song, ''Nattura,'' on iTunes at the end of October. It is a call to action to the government, businesses and citizens of Iceland to use the country's natural resources responsibly. She said she will use the song's proceeds to support green businesses in Iceland, as she is doing with the venture capital fund.LiNeBrEaK  ''I will not be able to live with my own conscience when my grandchildren drive around Iceland and it's just full of factories and smelters,'' she told The Associated Press. CLAIRE CAIN MILLERLiNeBrEaK  COMMENTSLiNeBrEaK  Bjork is a creative artist, though perhaps more than a bit impressed with herself.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	December 29, 2008 Monday   Sunrise Edition	BAILING OUT THE AUTO INDUSTRY A curious confidence in government competence  	Editorial; Pg. ETP  	728 words  	George F. WillLiNeBrEaKI n 1966, the price of eggs rose to a level that President Lyndon Johnson judged, God knows how, was too high. There were two culprits --supply and demand --and Johnson's agriculture secretary told him there was not much that could be done. LBJ, however, was a can-do fellow who directed the U.S. surgeon general to dampen demand by warning the nation about the hazards of cholesterol in eggs.LiNeBrEaKJohnson, the last president with a direct political connection to Franklin Roosevelt, was picked by FDR in 1935 to be Texas director of the New Deal's National Youth Administration. Two years later, Johnson came to Congress, a rung on the ladder that led to glory as Egg Czar. Today, with Washington experiencing a Roosevelt revival, Johnson's spirit, too, goes marching on as the federal government permeates the economy with politics. LiNeBrEaKOr not. In an interview with Business Week, Rep. Barney Frank, the effervescent Massachusetts Democrat who chairs the Financial Services Committee, was asked, concerning the auto industry, "How do you make sure the government doesn't meddle too deeply in day-to-day operations and bring politics --like a push for green cars --into the equation?" Frank replied: "Oh, well, a push for green cars is very much a part of what we're involved in. We don't think that's politics." So, when the government, its 10 thumbs stuck deep in the economy, uses its power to compel an industry to pursue the objectives of the political party that controls both of the government's political branches, that is not politics.LiNeBrEaKBusiness Week: "Should GM acquire Chrysler?" Frank: "I'm not competent to say." Frank's humility is selective: He obviously thinks he is competent to say what kind of cars should be made.LiNeBrEaKBusiness Week: "Does Congress realize how few hybrids have been sold, as it pushes Detroit to make them, and will Congress give consumers greater incentives to buy these cars?" Frank: Those who are "blaming the auto companies forget to blame somebody else --the consumers. In the recorded history of America, no one was ever forced at gunpoint to buy a Hummer. But we do believe that the combination of genuine concern about global warming and energy efficiency means people are now ready to buy these cars." Consumers are such a disappointment to Congress. But what Congress really believes is that people are not ready to buy those cars at a price that reflects the costs of making them. Why else has it voted tax subsidies for buyers?LiNeBrEaKForty years ago, Vietnam was a disaster and the Great Society was a disappointment as Johnson limped back to Texas. Today, there is more Johnsonian confidence in government's competence than at any time since Johnson's policies shattered such confidence. The resurgence of confidence began under today's Texan president.LiNeBrEaKThe domestic achievement for which George W. Bush will be most remembered, the 2001 No Child Left Behind law, was the seventh reauthorization of LBJ's 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which brought the federal government heavily into primary and secondary education. No Child Left Behind requires states to define "proficiency" in reading and math, and achieve 100 percent proficiency by 2014.LiNeBrEaKFrederick Hess, director of education policies studies at the American Enterprise Institute, notes that unless the "proficiency" standards are risible, the goal is delusional.LiNeBrEaKIt is ironic, Hess writes, that 50 states establishing divergent standards --the decentralized approach Republicans demanded --have sparked demands for centralization, in the form of national standards, a decade after congressional Republicans opposed President Bill Clinton's plan for voluntary national standards.LiNeBrEaKFurthermore, Hess notes, there has been striking dissonance between Republican resistance to race-conscious government policies, and No Child Left Behind "requiring states to identify every student by race and then report test scores --and impose sanctions --on that basis." The Johnsonian attributes of No Child Left Behind, which Hess says include "Great Society-style ambition and race-conscious rhetoric," suggest that the Egg Czar, who also was the first National School Superintendent, would feel right at home in a Washington where he could be Automotive Engineer in Chief.LiNeBrEaK2008, Washington Post Writers GroupLiNeBrEaKGeorge F.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	December 29, 2008 Monday   Sunrise Edition	Saving private forests  	Editorial; Pg. A10  	579 words  	SUMMARY: Conservationists are finally recognizing that the danger is not logging private forestland, but losing itLiNeBrEaKSaving private forestsLiNeBrEaKI t takes uncommon patience, and a long view, to grow trees for a living. It takes 40 years, sometimes longer, for an investment to pay off. Oregon's private timberland owners plant trees today not for their own economic benefit, but for their families, for long-term investors, for the future.LiNeBrEaKIt's a difficult business, especially now that forest products are a global commodity, pitting Oregon timberland owners against companies clearing huge swaths of forests in Brazil, Russia and other places with few environmental considerations. LiNeBrEaKIt was interesting to read Michael Milstein's recent report in The Oregonian describing how some environmental groups, but certainly not all, have evolved from fighting logging on private lands to helping ensure that those timberlands will not be given over to development.LiNeBrEaKAn estimated 1. 5 million acres of forestland is lost in the United States each year. And private-land forestry never has faced quite the economic challenge it contends with today, with enormous competition from around the world, the almost complete shutdown of the Northwest sawmill industry and the collapse in homebuilding and other construction.LiNeBrEaKThere's more money --in some cases, lots more --to be made selling timberland. As Matthew Donegan, co-president of a Portland investment firm that owns and manages timberland, told Milstein, "You're almost always better off selling it versus holding it." Donegan's company calculates that selling forest outright in Idaho would bring in 6. 5 times more money than holding and harvesting it over the long term. The payoff in western Oregon isn't so great, with selling bringing in 1. 5 times more than holding the land. But as land grows more scarce for development, that ratio will change.LiNeBrEaKIt makes sense for environmental groups to turn their focus from making life miserable for private timberland owners to helping them stay on the land. New development is a much greater threat to clean water, fish and wildlife than private-land logging, especially at a time when intact forests play a crucial role in sequestering carbon and reducing global warming.LiNeBrEaKOf course, not all environmentalists are prepared to stop fighting logging. Doug Heiken of Oregon Wild said his group will continue to focus on stopping clear-cutting and strengthening forest practices rules. He's not especially worried about private timberland owners selling their land because Oregon's strong land-use laws should block development. As Heiken told Milstein, "I'm a bit hesitant to make forestry a highly profitable enterprise, because it means there's going to be more logging." In other words, Oregon Wild, at least, is fine with seeing Oregon timberland owners struggle economically, betting that no matter how bad it gets for them, state land-use law will block them from doing anything else with their land.LiNeBrEaKThat's a risky strategy and a most cold calculation. We're glad to see more enlightened groups, including Ecotrust, The Nature Conservancy, The Conservation Fund and The Wild Salmon Center, coming to see that it is vital to help private timberland owners keep Oregon's working forests intact.LiNeBrEaKThe danger to Oregon's environment is not, and never has been, the families and the carefully run companies responsible for the stewardship of most of Oregon's private forestlands.LiNeBrEaKThe danger is losing them.

B-6  	245 words  	In regard to the feature that has been appearing in your Magazine section ("Dear Mr. President Elect"), I have noticed an alarming trend. It appears that many children are being brainwashed with the dogma of environmentalism/climate change. It is very disturbing that children are being taught this in schools, not as an opinion but as gospel. LiNeBrEaKClimate change was once called global warming, but since that can be disproved, the radical left now calls it climate change, which, of course, cannot be disputed because the climate is constantly changing. What nerve these people have teaching children that man causes the climate to change.LiNeBrEaKThere have been many periods throughout the history of the world that the world has cooled and the world has gotten warmer. To put the blame on man is sorely misleading and just plain wrong.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalism/climate change is the least of America's problems, and since communism has failed worldwide, the radical left needs a new calling card and this is it. It is a shame our country is now ruining our children by feeding them this garbage.LiNeBrEaKHopefully the parents of these children are paying attention to what is being taught these young fragile minds and fighting back.

Unofficial temperatures near Conway, Georgetown and in Brunswick County, N.C., would not be available until today. LiNeBrEaKThe average high for this time of year is in the mid-50s, Keebler said.LiNeBrEaKThe Myrtle Beach area is currently sandwiched between a low-pressure cold front moving in from the west and a high-pressure area sitting off the coast, Keebler said. That allowed winds from the southwest to bring in the warm weather.LiNeBrEaKPOLICELiNeBrEaKMYRTLE BEACHLiNeBrEaKWomen nabbed on prostitution chargesLiNeBrEaKTwo women were arrested in hotel rooms and charged with prostitution this week after they advertised on Craigslist, a Web site that offers free classified ads, according to Myrtle Beach police reports.LiNeBrEaKJudith O'Neal, 44, of New Port Richey, Fla., and Jennifer Carper, 22, of Myrtle Beach were arrested Thursday night and early morning, respectively, after they were contacted in reference to their advertisements by a Myrtle Beach police officer. They both met police in hotel rooms before they were arrested.LiNeBrEaKIt was unclear from the police reports whether the two incidents were related.LiNeBrEaKPolice said O'Neal told the officer on the phone that she would spend an hour with three separate men for $200 a person. Upon her arrest, O'Neal said she had just come to the hotel room to hang out and watch a game with three guys, the report said.LiNeBrEaKShe later told police that she offered companionship. Police said they found condoms in her purse.LiNeBrEaKCarper told police that she was a prostitute and came to the hotel room to have sex, according to the police report. A glass smoking pipe and a knife were found in her purse, the report said, and she was also charged with a paraphernalia law violation and possession of an illegal weapon.LiNeBrEaKMYRTLE BEACHLiNeBrEaKHousekeeper suspected of room robberyLiNeBrEaKA housekeeper at a Myrtle Beach hotel is suspected of taking money from at least one room on Saturday, according to a Myrtle Beach police report.LiNeBrEaKA guest at the hotel discovered around 6: 20 p.m. that $200 in the pocket of a jacket in a room at the Atlantic Palms Hotel at 703 S.

The Washington Post 	December 29, 2008 Monday   Suburban Edition	Californians Shape Up as Force on Environmental Policy  	A-SECTION; Pg. A03  	1277 words  	California Democrats will assume pivotal roles in the new Congress and White House, giving the state an outsize influence over federal policy and increasing the likelihood that its culture of activist regulation will be imported to Washington.LiNeBrEaKIn Congress, Democrats from the Golden State are in key positions to write laws to mitigate global warming, promote "green" industries and alternative energy, and crack down on toxic chemicals. Down Pennsylvania Avenue, Californians in the new White House will shape environmental, energy and workplace safety policies.LiNeBrEaK"It's unique in terms of the power of this state in modern times," said James A. Thurber, who directs the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. To find another example of a state wielding such national influence, Thurber had to reach back to Texas in the 1950s, when Sam Rayburn was the House speaker and Lyndon B. Johnson was the Senate majority leader. LiNeBrEaKThe current speaker, Nancy Pelosi, is the most prominent member of the California delegation. As leader of a sometimes fractious caucus, Pelosi has had to find common ground between conservative and liberal Democrats. But she has been firm about her intention to bring the kind of climate-change legislation embraced by California to the national level, and she was quietly supportive when a California colleague, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, pushed out Rep. John D. Dingell of Michigan to become chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.LiNeBrEaKIn a November caucus election, Waxman narrowly beat Dingell, who held the chair for 16 years and was seen by critics as too protective of the auto industry. Waxman, who has crafted an image as a champion of consumers, taxpayers and the environment, takes over next month. Energy and Commerce handles more than half of the legislation that flows through Congress. Its sprawling portfolio includes climate change, air quality and health matters -- issues that have consumed policymakers in California.LiNeBrEaKWaxman's counterpart in the Senate is Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee. "California has always valued protecting the environment and health and safety of our people," Boxer said in a telephone interview. "The people from California who are coming here to work on this and Congressman Waxman and myself, we are very strong on this."LiNeBrEaKObama has chosen Steven Chu, director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, to be energy secretary, and he tapped Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Nancy Sutley to run the White House's Council on Environmental Quality. Obama also selected Rep. Hilda L. Solis, a Democrat from Los Angeles, to become labor secretary, charged with enforcing workplace safety laws, among other duties. And Christina D. Romer, a University of California at Berkeley economist, will chair the Council of Economic Advisers.LiNeBrEaKOne longtime Capitol Hill observer cautioned that although these Californians are in key positions to shape federal policy, they don't necessarily share a single California philosophy. Still, they have been shaped by experience in a state that has led the nation in regulatory policy.LiNeBrEaKSince the 1970s, when it became the first state in the country to set its own auto emissions standards under the federal Clean Air Act, California has been considered a trendsetter.LiNeBrEaKWhen the state tried last year to set tougher emissions standards that would cut tailpipe emissions by 30 percent by 2016, 12 other states followed suit. The Bush administration denied the states, which are hoping the Obama administration or the new Congress will reverse that decision.LiNeBrEaKAfter the state banned a class of chemicals, phthalates, from children's products last year, 12 states introduced similar bans.LiNeBrEaKThis month, California regulators took the initial steps toward the nation's first comprehensive plan to curb greenhouse gases. The strategy creates a system of trading pollution permits and cutting emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Details of the plan are still under development. The next day, state regulators approved the most stringent rules in the country governing emissions from diesel trucks and buses.LiNeBrEaKThe California ban on phthalates inspired Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) to successfully push for a federal prohibition, which takes effect in February. It is a rarity -- the first time Congress has banned a chemical in decades -- and it faced stiff and well-financed opposition from Exxon Mobil, which makes one of the banned chemicals.LiNeBrEaKEven though Feinstein was not on the conference committee that resolved differences between House and Senate versions of the legislation, she worked behind the scenes to make sure the phthalates ban stayed in the final version, said Janet Nudelman of the Breast Cancer Fund, which pushed the bill.LiNeBrEaK"She made it clear that phthalates wasn't 'trade bait' between negotiators," Nudelman said. "The phthalates ban was an example of Feinstein, Boxer and Waxman literally reaching across houses to strategize and secure passage of a very controversial piece of legislation that no one thought had a chance of passing."LiNeBrEaKBoxer said the public should not expect a flood of new legislation modeled on California statutes, but rather a renewed effort to enforce existing consumer protection and workplace safety rules and environmental laws.LiNeBrEaK"It's not a question of passing new landmark laws," Boxer said. "It's a matter of getting these agencies back in gear. We have great tools, but they have not been functioning. For the past eight years, they've been sitting idle. The Californians coming, they don't have to rewrite the laws. They just have to enforce them. It's like the EPA has been asleep for eight years. The Californians are coming to wake the sleeping beauty."LiNeBrEaKStill, there will be revisions to existing laws and some new bills. Environmentalists and industry expect Waxman, Boxer, Pelosi, Sutley and the others to take on the oil and gas companies.LiNeBrEaKBarbara Sinclair, a political scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said the Californians are pragmatic and mindful of overreaching. "All these folks really want to make policy change," she said. "On the other hand, they very, very much want to stay in power." The most ambitious effort is likely to be a cap-and-trade bill that will sell emissions permits to industry with the aim of reducing carbon dioxide and other pollutants. Boxer introduced a version that died after debate in June. She intends to introduce a revised version in the new Congress, probably in concert with Waxman, who had written his own climate-change bill in the last session.LiNeBrEaKWaxman and Boxer joined Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) in sponsoring the Kids Safe Chemicals Act in the last Congress and plan to reintroduce it in the new year. The legislation seeks to reform chemical policy to require industry to prove chemicals are safe before they are used in commerce. Currently, the government must prove that a chemical is unsafe before it can be pulled from the market. The Lautenberg bill would put the burden on industry to prove a chemical's safety. The bill is modeled after a law in Europe but follows the same approach as a "green chemistry" law passed by California earlier this year.LiNeBrEaKRoger Martella, a former EPA general counsel who is an attorney for many corporations affected by environmental regulation, calls Waxman, Pelosi and Boxer a "trifecta" that could craft significant new government action.LiNeBrEaK"Whether at the end of the day every policy that California has gets implemented on a national level is a matter for debate," Martella said. "At the same time, we'd be foolish to ignore those stars are lining up."

The Charleston Gazette (West Virginia)  	December 28, 2008 Sunday 	'On the verge of an energy revolution'  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	503 words  	Dec. 28--"&gt; Read the report.LiNeBrEaKCHARLESTON, W.Va. -- New technologies will move the world economy away from coal and other fossil fuels much more rapidly than experts from the energy industry would have the public believe, according to a new study by the Worldwatch Institute. LiNeBrEaKHundreds of old coal-fired power plants that provide 40 percent of the world's power could be retired in the process, eliminating up to one-third of global carbon dioxide emissions, while creating millions of new jobs, the study asserted.LiNeBrEaK"We are on the verge of an energy revolution," said Christopher Flavin, president of Worldwatch and author of the report, "Low-Carbon Energy: A Roadmap," issued earlier this month.LiNeBrEaKWorldwatch, a nonprofit that follows environmental and poverty issues, argues that reducing dependence on fossil fuels will not only "strike a defiant blow to the climate crisis," but also act "as an agent of recovery for an ailing global economy."LiNeBrEaKThe 49-page report disputes arguments from coal industry advocates who say the world's energy future must be based mostly on finding ways to capture greenhouse emissions from coal-fired plants and pump those emissions underground.LiNeBrEaK"While these technologies are advancing, together with advances in modeling and monitoring of geological sites, full-scale commercial [carbon capture and storage] systems are still a long way off," the Worldwatch report said. "And a vast physical infrastructure will be needed to capture, move and store the emissions from even a fraction of today's fossil fuels combustion."LiNeBrEaKThe report found that government-sponsored carbon capture research projects in the United States, the European Union, Japan and China have moved at a "surprisingly lethargic" pace "given the urgency of the climate problem and the fact that much of the power industry is counting on CCS [carbon capture and storage] to allow them to continue burning massive amounts of coal.LiNeBrEaK"How large a role CCS ultimately plays in a low-carbon economy will depend on how much it costs, and whether governments and industries are able to successfully mobilize the massive infrastructure that will be required," the study said.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, the Worldwatch study said, there are concrete steps the world could be taking to transition to a low-carbon economy:LiNeBrEaK"We no longer need to say 'in the future' when talking about a low-carbon energy system," Flavin said. "These technologies -- unlike carbon-capture facilities -- are being deployed now and are poised to make the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels obsolete."LiNeBrEaKReach Ken Ward Jr. at kward@wvgazette.com or at 304-348-1702.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	December 28, 2008 Sunday 	Minnesota's iconic moose are dying off: Scientists eye climate change as the primary reason the beloved animals are disappearing, writes the Tribune's Tim Jones  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1019 words  	Dec. 28--It wasn't long ago that thousands of moose roamed the gentle terrain of northwestern Minnesota, affirming the iconic status of the antlered, bony-kneed beast from the North Woods. In just two decades, though, their numbers have plummeted, from 4,000 to fewer than a hundred.LiNeBrEaKThey didn't move away. They just died. LiNeBrEaKThe primary culprit in what is known as the moose mystery, scientists say, is climate change, which has systematically reduced the Midwest's already dwindling moose population and provoked alarm in Minnesota, where wildlife specialists gathered for a "moose summit" this month in Duluth.LiNeBrEaK"There's not a lot of opportunity to turn this around," said Mark Lenarz, a wildlife research specialist at the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. "Here in Minnesota, they [moose] have been weakened by climate change."LiNeBrEaKTemperatures tell much of the story. Over the last 40 years in northwest Minnesota, the average winter temperature has risen significantly -- 12 degrees -- while summers are 4 degrees warmer. Solitary and temperamentally grumpy, moose have made it clear in their estimated 13,000 years in North America that they hate warm weather.LiNeBrEaKThe mounting concern about the fate of the moose comes as the Bush administration in its last weeks is revising endangered species regulations in ways that prohibit federal agencies from evaluating the effects of increased global warming on endangered species.LiNeBrEaKOfficially, the moose is not endangered in the United States. But it is in danger of disappearing from the Midwest, which is the far southern fringe of its range. Roughly 7,700 moose reside in Minnesota, nearly all in the northeast section of the state. That's a drop of almost 50 percent in the last 20 years.LiNeBrEaKIsle Royale National Park, a 45-mile-long island in western Lake Superior, has about 650 moose, down from 2,500 in 1995. Michigan's sparsely populated Upper Peninsula has about 450, and that population has remained steady, according to a wildlife biologist at the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.LiNeBrEaK"The trends for the past 20 years are pretty clear, and if they keep up there won't be any moose in 50 years," said John Vucetich, a population biologist at Michigan Technological University in Houghton.LiNeBrEaKOne of the many questions raised by the demise of the moose is, "What does it mean if the moose go away?"LiNeBrEaKIt's not as if the moose leaving Minnesota and Michigan would upset a delicate ecological balance that would occur with, say, a dramatic falloff of the bird population that would allow insects to proliferate.LiNeBrEaK"That's the $64,000 question," Vucetich said. "As the climate warms, some creatures will do better, some worse. For moose it's fairly straightforward that we'll lose them ... and there are a lot of people who identify with moose."LiNeBrEaKThat identity, from wooden carvings to giant polystyrene moose next to roadside restaurants, helps define the region's image.LiNeBrEaK"They're a symbol of the great north, of wilderness, and a lot of people would not want to see that go away," Vucetich said.LiNeBrEaKAll romantic symbolism aside, the beasts are in big trouble.LiNeBrEaKMinnesota and Michigan offer separate living laboratories that help explain why the moose are dying. Heat, water and parasites play important roles, but temperatures are the trigger. While deer, wolves and bears have adapted to warmer temperatures, wildlife biologists say, the moose have suffered. Moose require shade, water and cool weather, each of which is dwindling in northwest Minnesota.LiNeBrEaKLenarz said the moose population in the northwestern part of Minnesota struggles among small patches of aspen woods and farmland.LiNeBrEaKWhen temperatures rise, the moose have to work harder to obtain food and find places to stay cool. Lenarz said that affects their immune systems, prevents them from putting on more fat in the summertime (which they need to get through the winter) and makes them vulnerable to infestations from parasites.LiNeBrEaKAlthough northeastern Minnesota is comparatively more moose-friendly -- greater shade, more opportunities to cool off -- the population is declining, albeit more gradually, by 10 percent to 13 percent per year. Lenarz said the pregnancy rate is a little more than half the norm for moose, and mortality rates are 2 to 3 times higher than the average.LiNeBrEaKHunting is not a significant factor. It is banned in northwest Minnesota and limited to 150 -- bulls only -- in the northeast.LiNeBrEaKHeading north to cooler climes is not an option.LiNeBrEaK"When moose are in trouble, they don't move. They die," said Rolf Peterson, a research professor at Michigan Tech and the chairman of the Minnesota Moose Advisory Committee. Peterson has spent decades studying the interrelationship between moose and wolves, the only big animals on Isle Royale.LiNeBrEaKMoose on the isolated island are not exposed to many of the threats from Minnesota -- cars, hunters and multiple parasites usually carried by deer. Wolves are the predators. Yet a decade-long trend of hotter-than-normal summers, according to a report issued in March, has negatively affected moose. Along with a drop of nearly 2,000 moose since 1995, temperatures are rising, leaving moose more vulnerable to disease.LiNeBrEaKThe summer of 2007 was the driest of the last 45 years, the report said.LiNeBrEaK"I don't see the temperature change we're seeing as cyclical. The trend is definitely in one direction," Peterson said.LiNeBrEaKMoose can be moved, as a herd was transferred from Ontario to the Upper Peninsula in the mid-1980s. But the options and the chances for success, in the face of climate change, are formidable, he said.LiNeBrEaK"I'm not terribly hopeful that the trend can be reversed by something we can do," Peterson said. "There aren't too many things we can do."LiNeBrEaKtmjones@tribune.com	CLIMATOLOGY (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); MAMMALS (90%); ENDANGERED SPECIES (90%); WILDLIFE (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (87%); TRENDS (76%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (76%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (76%); NATIONAL PARKS (75%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (75%); LAKES (62%)  		CHICAGO, IL, USA (89%) MINNESOTA, USA (98%); MICHIGAN, USA (94%); MIDWEST USA (92%); ILLINOIS, USA (89%); LAKE SUPERIOR (79%) UNITED STATES (98%); NORTH AMERICA (79%)  	December 28, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Chicago Tribune   	Tim Jones, Chicago Tribune  				Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	General  	20081228-TB-Minnesota-s-iconic-moose-are-dying-off-1228  	TB

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 	December 28, 2008 Sunday   Home Final Edition	RECLAIMING A SIMPLER LIFE;  Hard times will put consumers in self-sufficient mood, experts say 	FEATURES - HOME and GARDEN; Pg. 01I  	1104 words  	The coming year will be the best of times and the worst of times, trend spotters say, especially in the home and the garden.LiNeBrEaKThe worst-of-times part, of course, is due to the uncertain economy.LiNeBrEaK"Households will be making major lifestyle adjustments," said Ann Mack, director of trend spotting at the marketing communications firm JWT, "and many of these changes are likely to last beyond the recession.LiNeBrEaK"Consumers will find more value in what they already have, seek out products that give the most bang for the buck -- whether that means home-entertainment systems or solar energy -- and take up money-saving hobbies such as cooking and DIY projects."LiNeBrEaKThe best of times? That will come in the trend toward going green, partly driven by the worsening economy but also driven by the heightened awareness of climate change. LiNeBrEaKWhat's up for 2009? Here are some of the top developments.LiNeBrEaKtferan@dispatch.com LiNeBrEaK\ GOING GREENLiNeBrEaK"The No. 1 reason consumers look to go green is that it decreases operating costs," said Patti Prairie, chief executive of Brighter Planet, a company that helps consumers and businesses reduce their carbon footprint.LiNeBrEaK"Green homes use 40 percent less energy than comparable homes."LiNeBrEaKWhile some of the green movement affects new homes, even existing homes can become greener with better insulation, more efficient lighting and Energy Star appliances, she noted.LiNeBrEaKBut going green doesn't just mean energy-efficiency.LiNeBrEaK"The whole ecologically friendly green movement is very much coming into the world of home furnishings," said Jaclyn C. Hirschhaut, vice president of public relations at the American Home Furnishings Alliance.LiNeBrEaK"For instance, there have been some incredible new sustainable materials recently, one where the foam in cushions is going from oil-based material to a soy ingredient that reduces the impact on the environment.LiNeBrEaK"There's a company that is taking beverage bottles and using that plastic as a fiberfill for cushions. Surprisingly, the cost is not extraordinary; it's right in range."LiNeBrEaK\ MAKING REPAIRSLiNeBrEaKHomeowners will save money by becoming more practical, doing their own repairs and undertaking more ambitious do-it-yourself projects.LiNeBrEaKIn an October JWT survey, half of Americans said they were more likely to undertake a renovation project themselves now than they were a year ago.LiNeBrEaK"Rather than hiring a specialist for a leaky pipe or to paint the baby's room, you'll do it yourself," said Mack of JWT.LiNeBrEaKPushing that DIY trend, she said: "It's important to remember that this is the first recession when we have all these resources online for do-it-yourselfers.LiNeBrEaK"Now there are YouTube videos where you can watch someone actually doing that repair."LiNeBrEaK\ TURNING TO SOLARLiNeBrEaKSolar power is finally getting price-competitive, with ventures such as SolarCity expanding throughout the United States and SunRun Solar Service of California installing and maintaining panels on homes.LiNeBrEaKBut more builders will work all angles in taking advantage of the sun's rays, Prairie said.LiNeBrEaK"New-home builders are paying more attention now to orienting homes on-site to bring in natural daylight," she said. "That reduces lighting requirements and helps homeowners take advantage of breezes in the summer."LiNeBrEaK\ BUYING EFFICIENT FURNITURELiNeBrEaK"If there is any overriding trend, it's functionality," Hirschhaut said. "Consumers want space in their home maximized with efficiency."LiNeBrEaKWhen buying new pieces, the emphasis will be on furniture that can do more than one job.LiNeBrEaK"For people who need storage . . . there is an incredible range that offers great design and great functionality," she said.LiNeBrEaKIn particular, "The home office category is really taking off in a variety of directions. There almost isn't a home today that doesn't include a computer."LiNeBrEaKTo that end, in small settings such as apartments, new coffee tables double as laptop ports, with tops that lift to become work surfaces, she said.LiNeBrEaK"Another manufacturer came up with a family communications center," Hirschhaut said. "It's a nice piece of furniture that I see being used inside the back door of a house as a central place to keep everybody organized."LiNeBrEaK\ ENTERTAINING AT HOMELiNeBrEaKA recent JWT survey found that 72 percent of Americans are spending more time at home entertaining themselves because of budget reasons; and 22 percent said they plan to invest in home entertainment during the next six months.LiNeBrEaK"We're not talking about people buying the fanciest entertainment systems but renting or buying a DVD rather than going to a movie," Mack said. "When you take into account what you pay for tickets and popcorn and soda, it adds up. So why not rent a movie?LiNeBrEaK"Games also will do well," Mack said. "A lot of people who have already bought a gaming console will look to add a little freshness to their arsenal with the latest gChoosing 'nativars'LiNeBrEaKAs home gardeners become more informed about environmental concerns, one coming trend is toward the nativar, a variety or hybrid of a native species.LiNeBrEaKThe Garden Media Group predicts that popular new hybrids will include the Grand Bleu caryopteris and the Little Joe joe-pye weed.LiNeBrEaK\ ADDING WATERWORKSLiNeBrEaKWhether in fountains, waterfalls or fishponds, water will continue to turn more backyards into private oases in the coming year, the Garden Media Group predicts.LiNeBrEaKWater features such as fountains are showing up not only in the garden but also on tabletops, with the feng shui craze adding further impetus to the trend.LiNeBrEaK\ SEEKING SAFETY IN CELEBRITYLiNeBrEaKThe popularity in celebrity branding on a host of household items shows no sign of slowing. The popularity of celebrity items isn't just because of homeowners identifying with their favorite celebrity, however.LiNeBrEaK"When names like Martha Stewart and others coordinate a whole home collection, consumers can be confident that the bed they've picked out mixes with a range of dressers and nightstands, and a chair or bench goes with it, too," Hirschhaut said.LiNeBrEaK"The room may have an eclectic feeling by mixing materials, surfaces and colors, but it feels as if it's professionally done. Consumers don't have to worry about making mistakes."LiNeBrEaK\ PLANTING GARDENSLiNeBrEaK"The Greatest Generation" might feel nostalgic about victory gardens as they watch a repeat of the trend.LiNeBrEaKAccording to a recent survey of garden writers, more than half of Americans planted vegetables in 2008, and seed sales have more than doubled.LiNeBrEaKA recent National Gardening Association survey showed that do-it-yourself lawn and garden activities were up more than a billion dollars from the previous year, to more than $35 billion.LiNeBrEaKThat means 2008 was the first year since 2002 in which lawn and garden sales have increased, the gardening association said.

The Daily News of Los Angeles 	December 28, 2008 Sunday   VALLEY EDITION	NEW YEAR NEW LAWS {SUBHEAD} Burden on businesses expected to be light  	BUSINESS; Pg. A21  	680 words  	California businesses will catch something of a break in 2009.LiNeBrEaKTen federal and state laws that take effect Jan. 1 won't be much of a financial burden on them, according to the California Chamber of Commerce.LiNeBrEaKBut one, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, is cause for concern, said Marc Burgat, the chamber's vice president of government relations. The bill's implementation plan was recently passed and some regulations go into effect next year.LiNeBrEaKHowever, Burgat said the chamber hasn't been able to estimate a financial impact. LiNeBrEaK"I think what's most important to businesses is ... the ability to budget those changes over time, and I think the way it was drafted doesn't allow us to do that," he said of the implementation plan.LiNeBrEaKThe goal of AB 32 is to reduce pollution in California by 20 percent by 2020, said Stanley Young, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board.LiNeBrEaKAnd only a few regulations will be implemented next year, with the "lion's share" being developed over the next few years and implemented in 2012, Young said.LiNeBrEaKThe costs to businesses also will be addressed.LiNeBrEaK"We will deal with the economic implication of each regulation as we develop it," Young said.LiNeBrEaKBurgat said the state's financial crisis made 2008 an interesting year for businesses, legislation-wise.LiNeBrEaK"I think that because of the (state) budget situation, there were fewer bills that would have a major impact on businesses," he said.LiNeBrEaKHere is a look at some of the new laws.LiNeBrEaKFamily and Medical Leave Act - This pertains to families with active military personal. Companies with 50 or more employees must give workers who qualify 12 weeks of FMLA leave for short-notice deployment, attendance at official military events or activities, arranging or providing child care, attending school or day-care meetings, handling financial and legal matters, and rest and recuperation visits when the soldier is on leave.LiNeBrEaKCell-phone use - Since July 1, drivers have been required to use a hands-free device while talking on a cell phone and driving.LiNeBrEaKBut, unbelievably, they could still drive and type. Starting Jan. 1, however, text messaging and driving will be illegal. You can't read or write now while cruising streets and highways.LiNeBrEaKTemporary employees - Wages for employees of temporary-services employers shall be paid weekly or daily if an employee is assigned to a client on a day-to-day basis or to a client engaged in a trade dispute. It does not apply to employees who are assigned to a client for more than 90 consecutive calendar days unless the employer pays the employee weekly.LiNeBrEaKMinimum pay for exempt computer professionals - This allows computer professionals to be paid a monthly or annual salary. Before this change, computer professionals had to earn a minimum hourly rate, set by the Division of Labor Statistics and Research annually.LiNeBrEaKExemption for physicians paid on hourly basis - Licensed physicians or surgeons who are primarily engaged in performing duties for which licensure is required are exempt from overtime if they are paid at least the minimum hourly rate set annually by the state.LiNeBrEaKPassport cards for identification - The departments of State and Homeland Security have begun issuing "passport cards" that can be used as a "List A" document to verify employment in accordance with the I-9 form.LiNeBrEaKPolitical speech - These guidelines from the National Labor Relations Board concern employee participation in political activities. On-duty political advocacy for or against a specific issue, related to a specifically identified employment concern, is subject to restrictions imposed by lawful and neutrally applied work rules.LiNeBrEaKAnd leaving or stopping work to engage in political advocacy related to a specifically identified employment concern can also be subject to restrictions imposed by the employer.LiNeBrEaKNutritional information for chain restaurants - This law requires chain restaurants with 20 or more facilities in California to post nutritional information. It includes the total number of calories, grams of carbohydrates and saturated fat, and the number of milligrams of sodium.

The Dominion Post (Morgantown, West Virginia)  	December 28, 2008 Sunday 	WVU aims to improve research status  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	2951 words  	Dec. 28--Boosting research at WVU will not only improve the reputation of the university and its faculty, but officials say it will also grow the local economy, enhance teaching and attract top-notch faculty.LiNeBrEaKUniversities pursue research to help solve societal problems -- such as the energy crisis and global warming -- but Curt Peterson, vice president for research and economic development at WVU, said the ultimate goal is to stimulate the economy.LiNeBrEaKNigel Clark, a professor in WVU's College of Engineering and Mineral Resources and chairelect of the WVU Faculty Senate, said WVU has evolved into a competitive research institution over the past 20 years without really trying. But in a recent interview with The Dominion Post, Clark and other faculty members suggested that university leaders should take a more strategic approach for growth.LiNeBrEaK"We're growing," Clark said. "We're going to keep on growing. There is no doubt that the institution really needs to pause and examine itself. I think we're entering a more competitive era." LiNeBrEaKThe National Science Foundation ranks WVU 112th among 200 top institutions for research and development spending -- lower than all but two of its peer institutions. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching places WVU in the middle of its three rankings for research activity.LiNeBrEaKInterim President C. Peter Magrath has said he wants to see WVU climb in the rankings.LiNeBrEaKAnd other officials at WVU -- including Peterson and WVU Board of Governors Chairwoman Carolyn Long -- seem to agree the university needs to focus on expanding its research enterprise in the coming years.LiNeBrEaK"That's one of the things that makes us stand out," Long said. "We have to do a good job. We have to do better."LiNeBrEaKThe benefits of researchLiNeBrEaKAs the state's flagship land-grant, doctoral degree-granting university, stimulating basic and applied research is part of WVU's mission.LiNeBrEaKBut faculty members and administrators say that expanding the university's research enterprise will also help WVU keep up with other schools, generate more money, and boost its national and international reputation.LiNeBrEaKWVU shares ownership of intellectual property and other products generated by faculty research. Revenue is typically divided between the faculty member and the university, with WVU receiving about 60 percent of the profit.LiNeBrEaKRoyalties and associated income from research activity at WVU generated about $72. 2 million in 2008. In addition, faculty researchers at WVU filed 29 U.S. patent applications and 38 invention disclosures. Three U.S. patents and seven license agreements were issued to faculty members, according to figures from WVU's Office of Sponsored Programs.LiNeBrEaKSteve Kite, a professor of geology and geography at WVU, said start-up companies often grow out of university research, too, creating jobs and preventing graduates from moving out of state to find work. Four companies grew out of research at WVU in 2008, and a total of 14 businesses have been launched since 2002.LiNeBrEaK"A major research institution extends beyond the university," Kite said.LiNeBrEaKClark and WVU Faculty Senate chairwoman Virginia Kleist, an associate professor of management information systems, both said that WVU graduates who have gone on to start their own businesses across the country and around the globe often contact former professors and ask them to recommend new hires.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to the money generated by research, the money awarded to WVU for research also helps to aid the local economy. Clark noted that the bulk of the funding for research goes toward the salaries of faculty and other personnel who live and spend their money in the Morgantown area.LiNeBrEaK"As a land-grant institution, we must also feed back to the state, help the state and further the state," Kleist said. "Research actually feeds into that loop of enhancing the state of West Virginia."LiNeBrEaKPeterson said added research funding also helps faculty members develop their research agendas, increase their scholarship and build their professional reputation as experts within their discipline.LiNeBrEaK"Essentially, that brings more recognition to the university," Peterson said. "Greater recognition for the university brands us as an institution that has a major impact on research and development within this country."LiNeBrEaKAnd that helps WVU remain competitive with its peers and other schools nationwide.LiNeBrEaK"Unless you're striving to advance, you fall behind," Kite said.LiNeBrEaKResearch rankingsLiNeBrEaKWVU spent about $133. 5 million on research and development in fiscal year 2007 -- the latest year for which data is available -- and ranked 112th in total RandD expenditures among the top 200 institutions listed by the National Science Foundation each year.LiNeBrEaKJohns Hopkins University topped the NSF list in 2007, spending about $1. 5 billion on research and development.LiNeBrEaKWVU ranked below all but two of its 20 peer institutions -- schools determined by the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission to be comparable in size and programs to WVU. The University of Florida ranked first among WVU's peers and 17th overall with $592. 8 million in total RandD spending in 2007.LiNeBrEaKThe average for RandD expenditures among WVU's peers was $278 million in 2007, but WVU has steadily increased its total RandD expenditures since 2000. WVU outpaced 17 of its 20 peers in total growth in RandD expenditures over the past three years, increasing by 24 percent -- from $108 million to $133. 5 million -- and jumping five spots -- from 117th to 112th.LiNeBrEaKThe NSF list is one of several research ranking lists compiled each year, but Peterson said WVU pays close attention to that list "because it shows you the commitment on the part of the university to research and development and the total dollars that are invested in research and development."LiNeBrEaKWVU has increased spending largely by securing additional extersumer Sciences; and the Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center.LiNeBrEaK"More money is committed because there's more money available," Peterson said. "From the standpoint of federal agencies, the greatest bulk of the federal funding is available within science and engineering programs and within biomedical programs. There will be less funding available in the humanities and the social sciences, for example."LiNeBrEaKResearch in science and engineering typically costs more than other types of research, Peterson said, and it's often the basis for solving complex societal problems -- such as finding a cure for cancer -- that are hard to resolve.LiNeBrEaKWVU is also involved in several internal and external programs to increase funding for research and other activities.LiNeBrEaKThe university receives about $2 million from the NSF and $750,000 from the state each year through the U.S. Department of Energy's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), an initiative designed to meet the country's energy needs by increasing competition in energy-related research and development.LiNeBrEaKWest Virginia is one of 25 states that receive funding through EPSCoR. In addition to providing added money for research, employees at the state EPSCoR office assist faculty members at WVU by reviewing grant proposals and offering recommendations to improve them.LiNeBrEaKThe WVU Research Corp. has created its own Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, which provides funding to develop competitive proposals for external funding.LiNeBrEaKThe Research Corp. also launched an Advanced Energy Initiative program this fall that aims to boost research funding by $52 million through 2012. The energy initiative involves hiring six faculty members and four program directors to help develop research and form partnerships in three key areas -- fossil energy, sustainable energy and energy policy.LiNeBrEaKIt also includes a $500,000-a-year grant-writing program to help launch the proposed research programs, and an incentive plan to help motivate faculty to tackle complex societal problems.LiNeBrEaKPeterson has said that Bucks for Brains, a state endowment program that could generate a trust fund worth up to $70 million for research at WVU, will help to offset some of the long-term costs of the Advanced Energy Initiative.LiNeBrEaKThe Bucks for Brains program was created by the state Legislature in 2008. It requires the state to match the contributions of donors dollar for dollar, up to $35 million. The money will pay for research in four strategic areas -- energy and environmental sciences; nanotechnology and material science; biological, biotechnological and biomedical sciences; and biometrics, security, sensing and related identification technologies.LiNeBrEaKImproving researchLiNeBrEaKTo achieve a very high research rating from the Carnegie Foundation, Kleist said WVU would have to increase its graduate students and its research faculty.LiNeBrEaK"We do very well at our research [level] per capita despite lower research expenditures, fewer graduate students, fewer doctoral stunal funding for research. While university officials would like to devote more money to research, Peterson said, "we are doing the best we can with the resources we have to encourage research."LiNeBrEaKSpending less simply means that WVU's peers are able to develop their programs more quickly, Peterson said.LiNeBrEaKWVU is also one of 103 institutions nationwide recognized by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as having a high amount of research activity, a mid-level classification.LiNeBrEaKAbout 83 other schools nationwide are listed as doctoral research universities -- the most basic research classification -- and about 96 schools are recognized as having very high research activity, including 15 of WVU's peers.LiNeBrEaKKleist referred to the Carnegie classification in a presentation to the WVU Board of Governors last month. While WVU spends less money on research and has fewer doctoral students, fewer research faculty and larger class sizes than other schools in its research classification, she noted that WVU falls somewhere in the middle of the schools listed on Carnegie Foundation's per capita index for research productivity.LiNeBrEaKThe Carnegie classification is not necessarily better than the NSF ranking, she said, but comparing those lists and others helps WVU gauge where it stands.LiNeBrEaK"It's difficult to measure research," Kleist said. "If external funding shows this and the Carnegie shows that, and they're both showing that were doing a decent job here, that's good. We've all kind of got a good feeling that we are doing a good job." more competitive in our grant-writing ability," Peterson said.LiNeBrEaKWVU faculty researchers submitted 819 research proposals in the 2008 fiscal year. Of those, about 50 percent, or 409 proposals, were approved.LiNeBrEaKTotal sponsored funding at WVU -- an internal measure that includes all money received, even though it may not have been spent -- increased from $138. 5 million in fiscal year 2007 to $140. 7 million in fiscal year 2008, or 1. 58 percent. Sponsored funding for research has increased steadily since 2001, but that amount fell from about $87. 3 million in 2007 to about $82. 9 million in 2008 -- a drop of about 5 percent.LiNeBrEaKThe majority of sponsored funding received from federal agencies is typically provided by the National Institutes of Health. About $17. 4 million of WVU's sponsored funding for 2008 was provided by the NIH, but the university also received money from the NSF, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA, among others.LiNeBrEaKMost money generated and committed to research at WVU and other institutions across the country is for science and engineeringLiNeBrEaKAt WVU, about $68. 2 million, or 82 percent, of the sponsored funding received for research goes to the Eberly College of Arts and Sciences; the College of Engineering and Mineral Resources; the Davis College of Agriculture, Forestry and Con-Funding sourcesLiNeBrEaKFunding for research at WVU comes from a variety of sources, including the federal government, the state, industry, private contributions and the institution itself.LiNeBrEaKThough WVU and its regional campuses generate some money that is devoted to research, the bulk of the money spent on research is sponsored funding -- money received from other sources for a specific purpose. In some cases, faculty members submit research proposals to solicit funding, and in others, faculty members are awarded research funding based on earlier work.LiNeBrEaK"The state provides funding, but it's not enough," Peterson said. "The state could never provide enough funding to support the research and scholarship of the faculty. You have to find other sources of funding for that purpose."LiNeBrEaKPeterson said the WVU Research Corp. offers grant-writing programs and other initiatives to help faculty members compete for external funding and prepare new faculty to compete, too.LiNeBrEaK"So far, the evidence seems to suggest that we are becoming much dents," Kleist said. "My question is, if we were to increase our doctoral students, as well as our faculty lines for research, where would we go, where could we go? ... I would argue it would be pretty darn far."LiNeBrEaKKleist would like to see WVU take a strategic approach to expand its research infrastructure over the next 10 years, and the BOG and senior administrators seem to agree that research should be a priority.LiNeBrEaKMagrath has repeatedly said that WVU needs to boost research and BOG Chairwoman Carolyn Long said that "research is monumentally important to WVU."LiNeBrEaKAs the state's flagship university, Long said WVU acts as an "economic engine" for the state. She said the board's job is to move the university's research agenda forward by removing any barriers to research and facilitating agreements and programs to increase research funding.LiNeBrEaKThough research funding from traditional sources is limited and highly competitive, Clark said some schools have found success by working with businesses and other private sources to identify alternative sources of funding. WVU has already begun hiring more research faculty who are externally funded, he said.LiNeBrEaKMagrath has suggested WVU consider a fundraising campaign to help expand the university's research enterprise. Magrath has refused to say how much he thinks WVU should raise, but he has said it would to be up to the WVU Foundation, the university's private fundraising arm, to determine its feasibility and begin a capital campaign.LiNeBrEaKBill Nevin, director of communications for the WVU Foundation, said the Foundation is considering a capital campaign. Foundation leaders will discuss fundraising priorities with WVU administrators early next year and determine whether to move forward with a recommendation.LiNeBrEaK"Once university-wide fundraising priorities have been identified and approved by the WVU administration, a nationally prominent fundraising consulting firm would be engaged to conduct a feasibility study...," Nevin said. "Certainly, the recent financial crisis, and the status of the economy in the spring of 2009 are factors that will be considered in determining whether to move forward with a comprehensive campaign."LiNeBrEaKThe foundation's most recent campaign, "Building Greatness," ended Dec. 31, 2003. It lasted more than five years and brought in about $336 million -- $86 million more than the university's $250 million goal -- for student support, academic research and initiatives, faculty enhancement, library enrichment and campus development and technology at WVU.LiNeBrEaKKite, Clark and Kleist also identified several minor changes at WVU that could help to expand research, including increasing the staff of WVU's Office of Sponsored Programs and allowing faculty to submit grant proposals in an electronic format.LiNeBrEaKBut WVU has already made some improvements to help with research. Kleist noted that leaders at WVU have recognized that the university's undergraduate growth has reached its peak, and WVU has continued to increase standards for promotion and tenure of faculty.LiNeBrEaK"By making a more difficult tenure bar, you end up with a very strong, research-oriented faculty over time," Kleist said.LiNeBrEaKAccording to WVU's human resources department, about 2,343 -- or 35 percent -- of WVU's 6,745 benefits-eligible employees, which includes faculty and staff, will be eligible for retirement within five years, and Clark said WVU has set tough research standards for new faculty members.LiNeBrEaK"Faculty are not hired unless they have a fairly aggressive research agenda, and they're hired with very specific expectations that they'll be productive in research," Clark said.LiNeBrEaKClark said improvements to facilities at WVU have also helped to increase the faculty's capacity to conduct research.LiNeBrEaK"Buildings don't produce research, but there is no question that we have far better facilities than we did 20 years ago," Clark said.LiNeBrEaKThe creation of the WVU Research Corp. has also helped to encourage interdisciplinary research and make it easier to hire staff and procure equipment, according to Clark, Kleist and Kite. More recently, the Research Corp. has promoted top-down initiatives, such as the Advanced Energy Initiative, to drum up funding in areas where WVU has a particular strength or perceives there will be money available.LiNeBrEaKRegardless of the approach WVU takes to boost research in the future, Clark said it will be important for WVU to set the bar high, as other schools are also working to improve.LiNeBrEaK"That's a thing that people miss critically," Clark said. "You set your metrics based on today, and then find that your target has moved."

The Houston Chronicle (Texas)  	December 28, 2008 Sunday 	Texas Legislature could be going 'green': Priorities in upcoming session may include renewable energy, environmental jobs  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	772 words  	Dec. 28--Global warming might be critical to the future of the planet, but inside the Texas Capitol, it's never been much of a match for taxes and tuition.LiNeBrEaKThe upcoming legislative session, however, could be different, with lawmakers from both parties already talking about renewable energy, energy efficiency and so-called "green jobs" as priorities.LiNeBrEaK"The climate has changed, atmospherically and politically," said Tom "Smitty" Smith, executive director of the Texas office for Public Citizen, a consumer and environmental advocacy group. LiNeBrEaKFor some time now, Texas lawmakers have been cool to global warming, spurning several measures that dealt directly with the issue. That's because the state is America's power plant and gas pump and thus leads the nation, by far, in emissions of heat-trapping gases that contribute to climate change.LiNeBrEaKBut with a new president who pledged to cap carbon dioxide emissions and invest in renewable energy projects, lawmakers and lobbyists expect Washington to move aggressively to combat climate change.LiNeBrEaKChances are Texas lawmakers will continue a wait-and-see approach on rules regulating emissions, focusing instead on financial carrots in part because of concerns over the slumping economy.LiNeBrEaKWhat is emerging is an environmental agenda that could provide incentives for large-scale solar-energy projects, set goals for reducing utilities' energy consumption and promote efficiency through new building codes.LiNeBrEaKHeat-trapping gases are tied to energy use, because the process of burning fossil fuels emits carbon dioxide. So any measure to conserve energy can indirectly cut greenhouse emissions.LiNeBrEaK"There is a lot of momentum on renewable energy and energy efficiency," said Ken Kramer, director of the Sierra Club's Lone Star chapter. "That's where we're putting emphasis."LiNeBrEaKThe approach, in some ways, is through a side door because the declared intent isn't to control global warming. The Republican-controlled Legislature historically hasn't supported tough environmental rules, but has embraced renewable energy because of the economic opportunity.LiNeBrEaKTexas now has more electrical generating capacity from wind turbines than any other state, including California, which is generally seen in a greener tint.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia recently adopted the nation's first comprehensive plan to slash heat-trapping emissions, with a goal cutting them by 15 percent over the next 12 years through several means, including a system of trading pollution permits.LiNeBrEaKState Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat, has once again filed a bill that is patterned after the California law that led to the climate change plan. His bill is intended to achieve "the maximum feasible and cost-effective reductions" of heat-trapping gas emissions by 2023 by using a market-based strategy and better monitoring and reporting programs.LiNeBrEaKBut the bill has little chance of passage, legislative aides and lobbyists said.LiNeBrEaK"There isn't the political will or need to address this," said Steve McMillen, an Austin-based environmental attorney for Baker Botts, which represents coal-fired utilities, petrochemical plants and refineries.LiNeBrEaKGov. Rick Perry, for one, has warned that federal regulation of carbon-dioxide emissions would be economically disastrous to Texas. Such rules could disproportionately harm the state because of its concentration of refineries, chemical plants and coal-burning power plants, he said during a news conference last month.LiNeBrEaK"We would rather find ways to unleash our economy than strangle it," Perry said.LiNeBrEaKThe governor's Texas Advisory Panel on Federal Environmental Regulation also called for regulatory restraint because "recent climate research calls into question prevailing public perceptions of the cause and extent of global warming."LiNeBrEaKThe position troubles some environmentalists who believe it puts Texas at a disadvantage as other states and countries shape policy.LiNeBrEaK"It's sad that (Texas lawmakers) are still having the debates no one else is having," said Matthew Tejada, executive director of the Galveston-Houston Association for Smog Prevention. "They were one of the last to the party, and they're the last to leave. And it's sad because there is a lot of opportunity out there."LiNeBrEaKmatthew.tresaugue@chron.com	EMISSIONS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); SOLAR ENERGY (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (90%); LEGISLATORS (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); POWER PLANTS (89%); WIND POWER PLANTS (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (89%); LOBBYING (89%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (89%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (88%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); OIL and GAS CONSUMPTION (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (78%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (77%); WIND ENERGY (77%); CONSUMPTION (75%); SOLAR POWER PLANTS (69%); ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS (69%)  		HOUSTON, TX, USA (73%) TEXAS, USA (97%); CALIFORNIA, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	December 29, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Houston Chronicle   	Matthew Tresaugue, Houston Chronicle  	PUBLIC CITIZEN (57%)  			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	Government  	20081228-HO-Texas-Legislature-could-be-going-green-1228  	HO  														
Japan Times (Tokyo)  	December 28, 2008 Sunday 	EDITORIAL: China's miracle at middle age  	COMMENTARY  	932 words  	Dec. 28--It has been 30 years since China embarked on the greatest economic experiment in human history. In that time, the country has emerged from poverty and chaos to become one of the leading economic powers. It is tempting to call China's astounding growth an economic miracle, but the trajectory of the last three decades has been the product of planning, innovation and carefully tended capitalism. Today, China confronts many of the old challenges -- growth has been uneven, leaving many Chinese untouched by the fruits of success -- and new ones too. The current economic crisis and new constraints imposed by energy shortages and climate change demand new thinking every bit as bold as that embraced in 1978. LiNeBrEaKThree decades ago, China's future was uncertain. The Cultural Revolution was a blight on the nation's soul and left and right battled for supremacy in the post-Mao world. On Dec. 8, 1978, the wily survivor Deng Xiaoping was named head of the Communist Party, and he told the Third Plenum that the country should embrace reform and opening. At that time, the first cautious steps included small-scale private farming, a reversal of Mao's communal agriculture and industry. Farmers' energies -- and earnings -- were cut loose, left for themselves to enjoy. Two years later, Deng picked Shenzhen, a then quiet fishing village in the Pearl River Delta in southern China, as the site of the first Special Economic Zone to allow foreign investment and export manufacturing. With that, the boom began.LiNeBrEaKThe results have been striking. The economy has grown at an average rate of 9. 8 percent since 1978; for more than half that time, growth has been in double digits. Today, China is either the third- or fourth-largest economy in the world. Annual per capita income has gone from 380 yuan in 1978 to about 19,000 yuan ($2,760) in 2007. The number of Chinese living in absolute poverty -- less than $1 a day -- has dropped from 800 million to more than 10 million. (Millions more live on $1 to $2 a day.) In 1978, the much-sought "four big things" consisted of a bicycle, a radio, a sewing machine and a watch. Today, almost every Chinese home has one television and 15 million families have private cars. Home ownership is on the rise and the country is filled with market watchers who match the enthusiasm (and nervousness) of investors in Tokyo, New York or London.LiNeBrEaKThe process has not been smooth. There have been rear-guard battles fought by leftists who despair of the loss of socialist ideals -- and the loss of perks that were once theirs by right but now often belong to successful capitalists. Corruption is rampant, environmental destruction is breathtaking -- literally, for anyone who knows the murky Chinese skies -- and the income disparities are some of the worst in the world. Today, the country looks with trepidation at the global slowdown, and the Chinese Communist Party, whose reformist inclinations are not evident when it comes to politics, is now focused on sustaining the growth that is the foundation of its legitimacy.LiNeBrEaKChinese policy has been guided by two maxims. The first is Deng's famous quip that "it doesn't matter if the cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice." In other words, pragmatism, not ideology, would be China's compass. The second rule is that the country would "cross the river while feeling for the stones." An experiment of this nature is unprecedented; there is no guide.LiNeBrEaKCelebrating 30 years of progress, Chinese Communist Party leader Hu Jintao warned that the country faces difficult times. Economic growth has slowed from 11. 4 percent in 2007 to 9 percent this year, and next year could drop below 8 percent, the level at which new market entrants readily find jobs. When growth dips below the 8 percent mark, officials get nervous. In his speech, Mr. Hu noted that economic development is critical to achieving "enduring peace and stability" and warned that "nothing can be done without stability."LiNeBrEaKIn the face of declining exports, factory closings and massive layoffs, Beijing has adopted a 4 trillion yuan stimulus plan that aims to boost spending on much-needed domestic infrastructure. China has depended on foreign markets to fire its economic engine. Now, with overseas economies battling the downturn, China must stimulate domestic demand to generate growth.LiNeBrEaKThis change is only part of a broader economic redirection. While growth and wealth have fired consumers, China is already the leading emitter of greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese die prematurely as a result of bad air and water and contaminated products. One of China's environmental officials conceded that "China's reform and opening has achieved in 30 years the economic gains of more than 100 years in the West -- yet more than 100 years of environmental pollution in the West have materialized in 30 years in China."LiNeBrEaKThis grim warming seems out of place amid the celebration of 30 years of growth and transformation.

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 	December 28, 2008 Sunday 	Moving into the unknown, with gusto  	D; Pg. 2D  	673 words  	As we cling by our fingertips to the eaves of the old year, before we drop into the vast unknown of the new one, it is tradition to reflect on the past year, as the Review-Journal is doing today by offering our take on the Top Ten stories of 2008 in various categories, everything from sports to business, from concerts to news.LiNeBrEaKThe purpose in this exercise is partly pure entertainment and nostalgia, but also a harkening to the admonishments of philosopher George Santayana in "Life of Reason." LiNeBrEaKHe is remembered for suggesting that we should not forget, but in the fuller context he wrote:LiNeBrEaK"Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. ... In a moving world readaptation is the price of longevity. The hard shell, far from protecting the vital principle, condemns it to die down slowly and be gradually chilled; immortality in such a case must have been secured earlier, by giving birth to a generation plastic to the contemporary world and able to retain its lessons."LiNeBrEaKWhile Santayana's glass appears half empty, you might also say that remembering the good things that happened in the past better prepare us for making them happen again.LiNeBrEaKOne of the first lessons that should be learned is from the top local news story of the year, as selected by our news reporting staff, the hepatitis C outbreak at a couple of local colonoscopy screening centers. While many will wring their hands and bemoan a lack of regulatory oversight and frequent inspections and various Nanny State solutions, I can't help but wonder at the lack of alacrity in pursuing swift, conclusive and severe punishment against those who knowingly cut sanitary corners, playing a form of Russian Roulette with patients' lives. There are definitely lessons to be learned here.LiNeBrEaKOn the Business section front we find another object lesson that we keep learning but still repeating as the state's economy tanked, leaving more than 8 percent jobless with little likelihood of a rapid turnaround in 2009.LiNeBrEaKThe debate over whether to build coal-fired power plants near Ely is sure to heat up in the coming year even as we reach the end of one of the coolest years on record. Whither this much-touted global warming I keep reading about in all the politically correct newspapers that don't seem to have an ounce of skepticism?LiNeBrEaKEnough of the doom and O.J. and falling casino stock prices and elections and drive-by shootings and budget woes. There were also basketball teams advancing in the NCAA tournament, race car drivers, boxers and baseballers, as well as concerts, movies, shows and dining out. Enough to keep up lively debate about which is best and "did the Review-Journal critic see the same show I did?" comments.LiNeBrEaKMaybe your New Year's resolution will be to finally call and get tickets to "Jersey Boys" and see what all the buzz is about or check out just how foul-mouthed Bette Midler really is.LiNeBrEaKI'm curious about Heidi Knapp Rinella's top rated restaurant, Louis's Las Vegas. Maybe I'll get the DVD for one of those movies Carol Cling recommends. "Wall-E," really?LiNeBrEaKFrom the sublime to the mundane.LiNeBrEaK"Civilisation is cumulative," Santayana wrote. "The farther it goes the intenser it is, substituting articulate interests for animal fumes and for enigmatic passions. Such articulate interests can be shared; and the infinite vistas they open up can be pursued for ever with the knowledge that a work long ago begun is being perfected and that an ideal is being embodied which need never be outworn."LiNeBrEaKNow, on into 2009 with gusto. You'll read it here first, of course.LiNeBrEaKThomas Mitchell is the editor of the Review-Journal and writes about the role of the press and access to public information.

Muskogee Phoenix (Oklahoma)  	December 28, 2008 Sunday 	OPINION: So what good are prairie dogs? They won't chase sticks  	COMMENTARY  	625 words  	Dec. 28--So what good are prairie dogs?LiNeBrEaKIf you only appreciate animals that provide direct benefits to humans and simply tolerate those that don't aggravate humans, then you don't think prairie dogs have much value.LiNeBrEaKAfter all, you can't eat prairie dogs. Well, you probably could, but it would be like eating a rat. LiNeBrEaKAnd a prairie dog won't get your paper for you, it won't chase a stick, and it won't retrieve the ducks you shoot.LiNeBrEaKSo what good are prairie dogs?LiNeBrEaKSen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla.; Rep. Frank Lucas, R-Okla.; and the Oklahoma Farm Bureau don't think they're worth much.LiNeBrEaKThe three protested this month a proposed inquiry into whether the black-tailed prairie dog deserves legal protection as an endangered or threatened species.LiNeBrEaKI have to admit, like Inhofe, Lucas and the Farm Bureau, I'm surprised there would be an inquiry. Even though prairie dogs don't dig burrows all through the Great Plains as they did before European cultivation made it to the New World, I've seen lots of prairie dogs.LiNeBrEaKI was in the Oklahoma Panhandle one time and watched a rancher spread poison to do prairie dogs in. He told me the little beggars were everywhere. But that shows you how much I know about prairie dogs.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, new information was presented by WildEarth Guardians of Denver to warrant an investigation. The service stated a prairie dog plague in South Dakota, new poisons used against prairie dogs, and seemingly inadequate regulations protecting prairie dogs were reasons to make a study of prairie dog populations.LiNeBrEaKThat sounds reasonable now that I know that. What would a study hurt?LiNeBrEaKOh, but Marla Peek, spokeswoman for the Farm Bureau, hinted the threat of a prohibition against killing prairie dogs would mean the end of American agriculture. She believes the entire Great Plains would be given over to prairie dogs.LiNeBrEaK"A nightmare," she called the prospect. "To me, that is frightening."LiNeBrEaKNow Lucas didn't want to seem without compassion toward a cute, little animal, so he tactfully said, "I ... understand the need to preserve the diversity of species."LiNeBrEaKBut Lucas strongly opposes a study. He said he can't believe this "is a proper use of American taxpayers' money." So Lucas is concerned about diversity, but diversity is not worth the money it takes to ensure that we have it.LiNeBrEaKInhofe, though, gave his stock response. He said he's "skeptical" that a review is justified.LiNeBrEaKWell, of course, Inhofe is skeptical. He's skeptical about global warming. He's skeptical that there's a need to protect polar bears. He's skeptical about the need to protect the river shiner and dozens of other animals.LiNeBrEaKThis past Monday, the pope paid tribute to Galileo on the 400th anniversary of his use of a telescope that led to the discovery the earth revolves around the sun. Inhofe may be skeptical of that. He's about the most skeptical person in the world when it comes to science.LiNeBrEaKThe only thing he's not skeptical of is what the Farm Bureau and big business tell him.LiNeBrEaKSo what good are prairie dogs?LiNeBrEaKHey, prairie dogs don't start wars, they don't ask for loans they can't repay, they don't take bribes, they don't poison people even though people poison them.LiNeBrEaKAnd animal diversity is not just good policy. It's the best policy. Look it up -- don't let skepticism, or ignorance, ruin what's best.LiNeBrEaKTo write GerardClick Here	EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (91%); DOGS (90%); RODENTS (90%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (88%); MAMMALS (78%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (78%); WILDLIFE (73%); ENDANGERED SPECIES (70%); THREATENED and SENSITIVE SPECIES (68%); RIVERS (60%); GLOBAL WARMING (60%)  	JIM INHOFE (84%); BARNEY FRANK (57%)  	DENVER, CO, USA (75%) OKLAHOMA, USA (94%); SOUTH DAKOTA, USA (79%); COLORADO, USA (75%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 28, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008    	David Gerard, Muskogee Phoenix, Okla.

The New York Times 	December 28, 2008 Sunday   Late Edition - Final	An Emissions Plan Conservatives Could Warm To  	Section WK; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED CONTRIBUTORS TRANSITIONS; Pg. 10  	790 words  	Bob Inglis is a Republican representative from South Carolina. Arthur B. Laffer was a member of President Ronald Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board from 1981 to 1989.LiNeBrEaKCONSERVATIVES don't support tax increases that are veiled as  ''cap and trade'' schemes for pollution permits. But offer us a tax swap, and we could become the new administration's best allies on climate change. LiNeBrEaK  A climate-change bill withered in Congress this summer because families don't need an enormous, and hidden, tax increase. If the bill's authors had instead proposed a simple carbon tax coupled with an equal, offsetting reduction in income taxes or payroll taxes, a dynamic new energy security policy could have taken root.  LiNeBrEaK  Even if the United States extracts more of its own oil -- something it  needs to do -- it  will still have only 3 percent of the world's known oil reserves, and OPEC  will still be the cartel with 70 percent of the world's known oil reserves. Conventional discoveries and unconventional extractions (like shale oil) would improve our standing somewhat, but OPEC's easily extracted oil makes its members the undisputed kings of crude. LiNeBrEaK  If they're the kings, we're the vassals. As long as national security risks aren't factored into the cost of gasoline and as long as carbon dioxide can be emitted without penalty, oil will continue to have an advantage over emerging fuels in the marketplace, and we'll continue our ruinous addiction to it. LiNeBrEaK  We need to impose a tax on the thing we want less of (carbon dioxide) and reduce taxes on the things we want more of (income and jobs). A carbon tax would attach the national security and environmental costs to carbon-based fuels like oil, causing the market to recognize the price of these negative externalities. LiNeBrEaK  Nuclear power plants would then compete with coal-fired plants. Wind and solar power would have a shot against natural gas. Trains would compete with trucks. We would clean the air, create wealth and jobs through a new technology boom and drastically improve our national security.LiNeBrEaK  The market-driven innovation that brought us the Internet and the personal computer could quickly bring us new, cleaner fuels. A carbon tax that was fully offset (with payroll or income taxes cut by  a dollar amount equal to the revenues generated by the new tax) would be as bold as the threat that we face. LiNeBrEaK  Conservatives do not have to agree that humans are causing climate change to recognize a sensible energy solution. All we need to assume is that burning less fossil fuels would be a good thing. Based on the current scientific consensus and the potential environmental benefits, it's prudent to do what we can to reduce global carbon emissions. When you add the national security concerns, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels becomes a no-brainer.LiNeBrEaK  Yet the costs of reducing carbon emissions are not trivial. Climate change may be a serious problem, but a higher overall tax rate would devastate the long-term growth of America and the world. LiNeBrEaK  It is essential, therefore, that any taxes on carbon emissions be accompanied by equal, pro-growth tax cuts. A carbon tax that isn't accompanied by a reduction in other taxes is a nonstarter. Fiscal conservatives would gladly trade a carbon tax for a reduction in payroll or income taxes, but we can't go along with an overall tax increase.LiNeBrEaK  The good news is that both Democrats and Republicans could support a carbon tax offset by a payroll or income tax cut. Former Vice President Al Gore has argued for eliminating all payroll taxes and replacing them with ''pollution taxes.'' He said in a speech at New York University's law school two years ago: ''It would be, in other words, a revenue-neutral tax swap. But, instead of discouraging businesses from hiring more employees, it would discourage business from producing more pollution.'' LiNeBrEaK  The United States can't solve climate change alone. The Kyoto climate treaty was rightly rejected by the Senate because China and India weren't subject to its provisions. If China and India join the United States in attaching a price to carbon, their goods should come into this country without a carbon adjustment. But if they do not, every item they place on our shelves should be subject to the same carbon tax that we would place on our domestically produced goods, again offset by a revenue-neutral tax cut.LiNeBrEaK  If World Trade Organization rules entitle members to an unwarranted exemption from such a carbon tax, then we should change them.  Outliers should not be allowed to frustrate the decision-making of the countries that are trying to prevent the security and environmental train wrecks of this century.LiNeBrEaK  As president, Barack Obama, by working with conservatives as well as the members of his own party, can at once clean the air, create jobs and improve the national security of the United States -- a triple play for the next American century.

News and Observer (Raleigh, North Carolina)  	December 28, 2008 Sunday 	Joe DeSimone - 2008 Tar Heel of the Year  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	3447 words  	Dec. 28--It's perfect that Joe DeSimone is a chemist.LiNeBrEaKThe science, founded on an ancient quest to turn rocks into gold, is fundamentally preoccupied with transformation.LiNeBrEaKSo, too, is DeSimone, a chemist lauded with the highest honors and a potent force of change in North Carolina and beyond.LiNeBrEaKSince arriving at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1990, a fresh-out-of-grad-school assistant professor, DeSimone has become one of the nation's premier scientists -- the youngest member named to the National Academy of Engineering and, last summer, winner of the $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize, which many consider a step to the Nobel.LiNeBrEaKAlong the way, he has founded companies, led the university into entrepreneurial ventures, received more than 100 U.S. and international patents, pulled in millions of dollars in federal grants and built a research empire poised to become a major player in the emerging field of nanotechnology. LiNeBrEaKAt 44, DeSimone hasn't even hit midcareer.LiNeBrEaK"To say he is extraordinary would be an understatement," says Erskine Bowles, president of the University of North Carolina system.LiNeBrEaKDeSimone's current research in nanotechnology -- mass producing microscopic particles in any size or shape -- could be a blockbuster. Nanoparticles hold promise because, among other things, they can be loaded with chemotherapy drugs or completely composed of medicine, like tiny pills, and home in on disease sites in the body.LiNeBrEaK"The potential power is quite significant," said Dr. Anna Barker of the National Cancer Institute. On the strength of DeSimone's breakthrough, Barker said, the government agency awarded UNC-CH one of eight national centers for nanotechnology research, providing $5 million a year for five years.LiNeBrEaKIt's the kind of attention that makes DeSimone highly sought after. Keeping him from leaving North Carolina, say Bowles and others, is the academic equivalent of retaining a Dean Smith. Twice DeSimone has been wooed by top universities, and twice he has been persuaded to stay, given salary raises, promotions and other inducements.LiNeBrEaKWhat has held DeSimone more than anything, however, is the university's willingness to consider change -- change in the way academic science is conducted, change in how discoveries are brought to the market.LiNeBrEaKSuch an approach is crucial to curing cancer, curbing global warming, creating technologies that improve the world -- the things DeSimone says he wants to do.LiNeBrEaK"This is how we can solve the greatest problems of our time," he says.LiNeBrEaKDeSimone doesn't know his IQ, but his mental agility might rank in the freaks-of-nature category.LiNeBrEaK"He's in the upper 1 percent of people I've dealt with, in terms of brilliance and importance to an institution," said James Moeser, the former chancellor at UNC-CH who helped craft incentive packages to keep DeSimone from leaving.LiNeBrEaKFriends and colleagues say DeSimone's genius lies in applying complex science to solve everyday problems. It's what caught the attention of the Lemelson-MIT Prize committee, which cited DeSimone for the breadth of his innovations -- from green manufacturing to medical devices to nanomedicine -- and his "unique ability to transfer his novel solutions from the lab to the marketplace."LiNeBrEaKThat ability was evident from the start, when he gained fame in the early 1990s for developing an environmentally friendly dry-cleaning process using carbon dioxide instead of a toxic petrochemical. The process, licensed by UNC-CH, became the foundation for Hangers Cleaners, a dry-cleaning franchise DeSimone founded in 1996.LiNeBrEaKAt the time, Hangers was one of the state's fledgling entrepreneurial efforts to commercialize the fruits of academic innovation. Now technology transfer is a common practice at UNC-CH and N.C. State University, where DeSimone holds a joint professorship, but DeSimone's leap from laboratory to marketplace set a new pace.LiNeBrEaKThe same year Hangers was formed, DeSimone and UNC-CH struck a licensing agreement with DuPont. The chemical giant agreed to build a plant in Fayetteville and use DeSimone's carbon dioxide process for making Teflon -- a ubiquitous coating that had become controversial for a hazardous chemical involved in manufacturing. DeSimone's process eliminated toxicity.LiNeBrEaKBoth processes sprang from an idea DeSimone originally had as a graduate student at Virginia Tech, where he studied polymer chemistry -- the science behind plastics. He noodled with the idea of using supercritical carbon dioxide -- a form between gas and liquid -- in combination with other chemicals to create novel cleaning processes and plastics. The idea wasn't fully formed, but when DeSimone was set to graduate in 1990 and began applying for jobs, he tossed it out to a few prospective employers.LiNeBrEaKOf 13 job interviews, he had 17 offers from chemical companies such as DuPont and Dow, where he was certain to start at $55,000 a year -- a princely sum to a 24-year-old Ph.D. But he also interviewed at three universities, even though DeSimone had not done postdoctoral research, which most require of beginning professors.LiNeBrEaK"My colleagues said no, we're not interested in this guy," says Ed Samulski, who started UNC-CH's polymer chemistry program and made DeSimone his first hire. "I pressured the committee a little, and they reluctantly agreed. They said, 'You can bring this guy in if you want, and we'll try not to embarrass him.'LiNeBrEaK"When he came, he essentially blew everybody away."LiNeBrEaKEarly sacrificesLiNeBrEaKThe pay at UNC-CH was $20,000 lower than DeSimone had been promised in industry. His office was in a dark basement of Venable Hall, a relic of a building famous for its dungeonlike, subfloor corridors. He had four students, no guarantee of tenure, and one colleague in polymer chemistry -- Samulski.LiNeBrEaKLiking his idea about supercritical carbon dioxide, the university gave him wide latitude to pursue the science.LiNeBrEaK"He was so happy, so excited," his wife, Suzanne, recalls. "When you're creative, the last thing you want to be told is what you have to do."LiNeBrEaKSo the DeSimones moved to Carrboro from Blacksburg, Va. -- Joe and Suzanne and their young son, Philip. Daughter Emily was born in 1992. They moved into a cookie-cutter neighborhood of 1,700-square-foot houses, where Joe graded the front yard for grass seed by pulling Philip on an old gate. Suzanne went to work at a chemical company in the accounting department.LiNeBrEaKIt was a life that would become far removed from anything they had known, but it began on familiar, unpretentious footing.LiNeBrEaKBoth DeSimones rose from deep, blue-collar roots. High school sweethearts, they married a month after Joe graduated from Ursinus College, a small liberal arts school in their hometown of Collegeville, a Philadelphia suburb.LiNeBrEaKJoe lived at home, a "townie" who also served on the volunteer fire department and stocked grocery shelves at the ACME market on weekend nights. His father, an Italian immigrant, held two jobs as a tailor at competing department stores, and his mother was a part-time bookkeeper.LiNeBrEaKDespite winning top honors in high school, DeSimone never considered a place such as Harvard or Yale, and he instead chose to attend Ursinus because he didn't have to pay room and board.LiNeBrEaK"We were not worldly about what Ivy League meant," he says. "To us a big school was Penn State or Villanova."LiNeBrEaKSuzanne went into the work force right after high school, at an insurance company by day and the grocery store at night.LiNeBrEaKIn choosing North Carolina, Suzanne was hesitant, because it was so much less money than Joe could have made in industry. But she loved his enthusiasm and shared his appreciation that the university took a chance on him when he didn't have the usual credentials, nor a fancy academic pedigree.LiNeBrEaKThat appreciation runs deep in both of them. Friends cite the couple's loyalty -- to old friends, to the university, to their roots. DeSimone keeps test tubes of concoctions he made in college and grad school, still has a wooden shop stool he made in middle school, roots for the Tar Heels despite a huge tug on his heart when they play the Virginia Tech Hokies.LiNeBrEaKA major sports fan -- he longed to play quarterback on the high school football team, but even before he grew to his current 6'3" and 265 pounds, his coach had him pegged as a lineman -- he remains a fierce fan of all teams Philadelphia. At a Carolina Hurricanes game one night, he was picked up on the Jumbotron and proudly flashed his orange-and-black Flyers jersey.LiNeBrEaKEven as his career took off, he mixed a successful formula for maintaining balance. He's self-assured but not arrogant. He's constantly busy but not flustered. He regularly takes red-eye flights home so he can eat breakfast with his family -- an ethic he learned from his mom, who bundled up dinner and carted the children to his dad's second job so the family could eat together.LiNeBrEaKAmong his best friends are college mentors and former students. The Samulskis are like family.LiNeBrEaKDeSimone's first grad student, Valerie Ashby, remembers meeting him in his basement office, just days after he arrived. Boxes were stacked on his desk, and the dingy quarters were lit by a single window at ground level.LiNeBrEaK"You could see the ankles of people walking by," Ashby says. He was 25, she was 23, but he became her mentor and remains so "until I take my last breath," she says. She credits him with mapping a path for her future, providing a vision of how to pursue her dream of a career in academia. When Ashby took a job on the faculty at Iowa State University, turning down a job at MIT, DeSimone was incredulous.LiNeBrEaK"We laugh about it," she says, noting that the move was perfect for her at the time. "I have always been clear about who I am, and he has been clear about what I could be."LiNeBrEaKFive years ago, DeSimone helped woo her back to Carolina, and this month, she delivered the commencement address to December graduates.LiNeBrEaKSuccess and setbacksLiNeBrEaKIt wasn't long before people were referring to DeSimone as a science superstar. His record of creating new uses and processes for carbon dioxide fueled large federal grants to support more research -- so large, in fact, that his grants were quickly surpassing the startup money departments give new professors to establish their labs.LiNeBrEaKDeSimone was awarded tenure in five years and given a simultaneous appointment at NCSU in its chemical engineering department.LiNeBrEaKBut it wasn't all rosy. By the early 2000s, DeSimone's two prominent successes at DuPont and Hangers were running into problems. Hangers wasn't catching on among mom-and-pop dry-cleaning owners, in part because the equipment was far more expensive than traditional machines, and the business eventually fizzled.LiNeBrEaK"It was immensely frustrating and disappointing," he says.LiNeBrEaKThen DuPont did not expand its investment in DeSimone's Teflon process beyond the Fayetteville plant, and because DeSimone and UNC-CH had granted the company exclusive licensing rights, they could not sell the technology.LiNeBrEaKFrom both experiences, DeSimone says, he learned valuable lessons. And there were always new opportunities. Just as the Hangers venture was winding down, DeSimone ran into an acquaintance at a party, UNC-CH alum and venture capitalist William Starling, who mentioned his work with a cardiologist at Duke. They were trying to develop a tiny coil called a vascular stent that could be implanted to deliver artery-opening drugs and then gradually dissolve as if it had never been there.LiNeBrEaKDeSimone joined the team, and soon helped make the absorbable stent act like metal to prop open a blocked artery.LiNeBrEaK"It was like a fresh, new ocean," he said. "It felt really rejuvenating to think about something other than carbon dioxide and polymers."LiNeBrEaKWithin eight months, the Synecor group developed a prototype stent, tested it in animals and sold it for more than $100 million. DeSimone, who had a single-digit percentage ownership for his role in the stent's development, stands to make millions.LiNeBrEaKBut that wasn't all. He got his feet wet in the fast-moving current of medical technology. He was eager to dive in.LiNeBrEaKOne idea, then anotherLiNeBrEaKUtility is a hallmark of DeSimone's science, and he tells his students that unless something can be put to use, it's not worth much. That credo fed his creativity and led him into polymer chemistry -- an area of science that had the bland veneer of practicality. Now, he was driven to figure out how his science might be applied to a whole new realm, manipulating polymers to help sick people.LiNeBrEaKOne of his lab's discoveries was a Teflon-like material that was liquid. It could be pressed into different forms, then solidified with heat or light. Once cured, it was impervious to solvents.LiNeBrEaK"It turned out to be an excellent molding material," DeSimone says. He filed for patents, and in 2003, his group used it to make tiny diagnostic tools called Lab on a Chip to help detect cancer. Previously, the tiny chips were made on expensive silicon wafers. Now they could be mass-produced on relatively cheaper plastic. That gave DeSimone other ideas.LiNeBrEaKUsing an advanced printing press technique used to make computer chips, the liquid Teflon-like substance could churn out perfect molds on a tiny scale -- essentially a long series of minute ice cube trays. The particles that sprang from the trays were even smaller -- nanosized, one billionth of a meter. He now has 80 patents pending in the technology.LiNeBrEaKThis work created an immediate stir. By mass-producing the particles in unique sizes and shapes, scientists could for the first time take advantage of geometry -- an evolutionary step that had previously been nature's edge.LiNeBrEaKNow drugs could be built to mimic pollen particles, which are uniquely capable of infiltrating the lungs. Drugs could also mimic bacteria, which are savagely good at busting into cells.LiNeBrEaKDeSimone formed a company called Liquidia to make the particles and market the technology for other uses. UNC-CH has an equity stake, and many of his former students are principals and owners.LiNeBrEaKJason Rolland, a co-owner of Liquidia who helped develop the production technology for the nanoparticles as a Ph.D. student in DeSimone's lab, said his main goal in studying under DeSimone was to get his doctorate and go to work in industry. Founding a company was not on his mind.LiNeBrEaK"Joe believes in you so much it's scary," Rolland says. "He makes you realize an ability in yourself you didn't know you had."LiNeBrEaKThe company now employs nearly 40 people at its offices in Research Triangle Park and has advanced from the startup stage. After a national search, a chief executive officer, Neal Fowler, was hired from a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson.LiNeBrEaKEverything was going along smoothly when, last fall, MIT called DeSimone. Two weeks later, Stanford was on the phone. For the scientist who had crashed UNC-CH's doors with no Ivy League pedigree, the prospect of being wooed by the toniest of suitors was tempting.LiNeBrEaK"I felt like I had to listen," he says.LiNeBrEaKUNC, NCSU join forcesLiNeBrEaKHe had received other calls from prestigious ZIP codes. In 2002, Georgia Tech and the University of Florida both tendered offers. DeSimone and his wife even went house-hunting in Atlanta, but the counteroffer from UNC-CH gave him most of what he needed and some of what he wanted -- primarily a $3 million photolithography tool that was crucial to his research. It's housed at N.C. State. He was also made director of UNC-CH's Institute for Advanced Materials, Nanoscience and Technology and given a $27,000 raise. He now earns $263,000 a year.LiNeBrEaKSuzanne DeSimone says the prospect of leaving North Carolina was wrenching. They had built a 3,000-square-foot house on a huge lot in the Orange County countryside and had redone an old cottage at Holden Beach. Although Joe traveled constantly for academic seminars and other work -- he had been tapped as a science adviser to the Department of Defense and holds a security clearance -- Chapel Hill was home.LiNeBrEaKFor a move, she says, she wanted to see the spark in her husband that had been there when they originally settled on UNC-CH.LiNeBrEaK"There was not the excitement," she says.LiNeBrEaKThe family was on vacation in New York when DeSimone decided to stay in North Carolina.LiNeBrEaK"Looking back on the first retention, I view that as an investment. And it truly paid off," says Moeser, the former chancellor. "UNC is one of the top 10 universities in material sciences, and we don't even have an engineering program. All the others we compete with have that."LiNeBrEaKMoeser says losing DeSimone would mean more than losing the millions of dollars he wins in grants and the massive lab complex he has built.LiNeBrEaK"When you're talking about Joe, it's not just an individual, but a whole team," he says. "In many ways, Joe DeSimone is a franchise."LiNeBrEaKNo one was prepared to lose that franchise last fall. In short order, a second retention package was put together, including another salary boost. And being named Chancellor's Eminent Professor gives DeSimone a direct line to the chancellor on issues involving the university's science mission.LiNeBrEaKThat is of utmost importance to DeSimone. He wants the university to be more nimble in turning innovations into marketable products. And he wants to break down barriers between the different sciences. That's been his top goal in recent months, promoting a new approach to scientific research that would basically allow science students of any discipline to conduct research across all fields.LiNeBrEaK"The idea is to have a community of scholars so we can do what can't be done at other places," he says.LiNeBrEaKMany embrace his approach. Others don't. DeSimone wants to loosen scientific divisions that are as old as the university itself. In a meeting of science department heads, DeSimone makes his pitch. The head of the physics department, Laurie McNeil, expresses her department's concerns. As it is, she says, there are fears that research decisions will be dictated by DeSimone.LiNeBrEaK"Planning has not been done with other departments," McNeil said of the advanced materials institute DeSimone has run that would fold into the new curriculum he is advocating. "The decision-making process is 'What Joe wants.' "LiNeBrEaKDeSimone is undeterred.LiNeBrEaK"He doesn't give a darn that we have these departments and various structures in the university," Chancellor Holden Thorp says, laughing. "He doesn't allow any of that to influence what can be accomplished.LiNeBrEaK"Yeah," he says, "that ruffles feathers."LiNeBrEaKExtraordinary goalsLiNeBrEaKDeSimone sits next to a potential Ph.D. student visiting his office in the bright, new Caudill Labs science building at UNC-CH.LiNeBrEaKThere is no finer space on campus, with two massive, arched windows that look out over the main quad. Through a third window behind his desk rises another science building in a hole once occupied by the decrepit Venable building. Down the hall are bright labs, including a clean room where his students don paper gowns and latex gloves and use custom-made tools to produce the tiny particles for testing in cancer tumors.LiNeBrEaKIt's a long way from the tiny, dark basement where he unpacked his boxes 18 years ago.LiNeBrEaKAt the entrance to his new quarters are 39 of his patents arranged on wooden plaques behind plexiglass -- a storyboard of innovation from a dry-cleaning process to nanoparticles. Framed newspaper and magazine articles about DeSimone line the walls above the bookshelves. Hefty glass and bronze awards fill another set of shelves.LiNeBrEaKDeSimone flips open his laptop for a slide show that demonstrates to the student, who will graduate in May with an Ivy League degree in applied mathematics, why she should consider joining his team in the chemistry department at UNC-CH.LiNeBrEaKIn the world of Joe DeSimone, it's no leap of logic for a math student to become a part of one of the nation's top academic chemistry programs. A math Ph.D. could do work in his chemistry lab calculating how many tiny particles are necessary to inflict death in cancer cells.LiNeBrEaKHer candidacy, in fact, is exactly what DeSimone wants to promote at UNC-CH, where he envisions an army of mathematicians, biologists, engineers, physiologists, physicists and others collaborating "to solve the biggest problems of our time."LiNeBrEaKIt's a phrase he uses over and over again. From DeSimone, a master chemist who practices an alchemy that succeeds, it's no false promise. He has discovered how to turn ideas into solutions, and that's as good as gold.LiNeBrEaKsavery@newsobserver.com or 919-829-4882	DISEASES and DISORDERS (89%); RESEARCH (89%); CANCER (88%); NANOTECHNOLOGY (88%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (78%); MEDICAL RESEARCH (78%); AWARDS and PRIZES (77%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (76%); COLLEGES and UNIVERSITIES (76%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (76%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (73%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (71%); PATENTS (68%); GRANTS and GIFTS (68%); CANCER DRUGS (65%); CHEMOTHERAPY and RADIATION (65%); WAGES and SALARIES (61%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%); GRADUATE and PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS (71%)  		NORTH CAROLINA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 28, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 News and Observer   	Sarah Avery, The News and Observer, Raleigh, N.C.

Palo Alto Daily News (California)  	December 28, 2008 Sunday 	Palo Alto, Calif., developer launches initiative to turn tide on global warming  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	609 words  	Dec. 28--As Palo Alto works toward the city council's ambitious goal of reducing city-wide emissions by 15 percent from 2005 levels, it's getting a push from a local developer who believes small businesses, collectively, can make a big difference.LiNeBrEaKJim Baer, chief executive of Premier Properties, believes going green tends to be relatively easy for governments and big companies, which can hire consultants and implement sweeping plans, and private citizens, who can simply change their personal habits. But organizing small- and medium-sized businesses around climate change goals is tougher, because there are so many of them but none is large enough to make much of an impact on its own. LiNeBrEaKIt's not that they don't want to make their operations cleaner and more efficient, Baer said. It's just that they're not always sure the best way to go about it.LiNeBrEaKEnter Wave One, the initiative he launched in May to enlist banks, architects, real estate agents and other small firms in the fight against global warming. Instead of expecting each to find its own way toward saving energy, Baer's plan is to organize them into clusters that can all take the same measures at the same time. Baer launched the project with a goal of getting 25 businesses per month to reduce their water and energy use, enroll in the Palo Alto Green program and become certified as green businesses. He has already hired three part-time staff members, teamed up with the Palo Alto-based environmental group Acterra to gain non-profit status, and lined up some 75 business owners willing to participate.LiNeBrEaKThe interest has been so strong, he said, that the goal of 25 per month might end up being conservative.LiNeBrEaK"Right now there's the willingness of businesses, the good intentions of businesses, but when they decide to contact the city our the county or a nonprofit to help them, it's random access," he said. "That inevitably creates inefficiencies."LiNeBrEaKEliminate the randomness, however, and the process becomes smoother. "If we're organizing the light auditors for 10 businesses on Emerson Street on the same day, or the replacement of 10 lights for businesses downtown, then it's efficient," Baer said.LiNeBrEaKPalo Alto insurance agent Jeri Fink was one of the first to sign up and has already had her business evaluated. She Jim Baer, chief executive of Premier Properties said the auditors' advice has shown her that becoming a green business doesn't have to be daunting or complicated. "That's the biggest thing -- is they're there to guide you," Fink said of Wave One. "Otherwise a lot of people won't make the effort."LiNeBrEaKMayor Larry Klein called Wave One an "exciting idea" that could be instrumental in helping the city meet its climate targets.LiNeBrEaK"We need things like that," he said. "We're not going to get anywhere in the fight against global warming without people participating in a lot of different ways. We can't just depend on the government." If it works in Palo Alto, Baer said, Wave One could become a model for cities nationwide. In fact, that's the genesis of the project's name. "We view this as an intensified pilot program," he said. "We're just the first wave of a thousand waves. We have to have the business community organize itself to make this happen."

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	December 28, 2008 Sunday 		NEWS; Local; Pg. 1  	1675 words  	Nearly 1 in 10 of us are now unemployed. Proportionally, the state budget deficit is the biggest in the nation. Bridges are crumbling. And emus are on the loose.LiNeBrEaKBut hey, gas is cheap and we found Joe Onions, right? So quit your complaining. At least someone can rest in peace.LiNeBrEaKOK, so 2008 wasn t our best year here in Rhode Island.LiNeBrEaKOn the first day of the year, the General Assembly convened amid talk of a $151-million current-year budget deficit, and House Majority Leader Gordon D. Fox said,  It s going to be rough.  LiNeBrEaKMaybe all you need to know is that those were good old days.LiNeBrEaKBy year s end, Rhode Island s unemployment rate stood at 9. 3 percent, among the highest in the nation.LiNeBrEaKOn the home front, more than one in four single-family houses sold during the third quarter of the year were foreclosures or  short sales,  in which the house sold for less than the amount owed on the mortgage.LiNeBrEaKAt the State House, Governor Carcieri and the General Assembly are facing a projected $357-million budget gap   the largest deficit in the country as a percentage of state spending, and they re scrambling to find ways to slash spending and haul in new revenue.LiNeBrEaKTo fix roads and bridges and to rescue the RIPTA bus system, the governor s Blue-Ribbon Panel for Transportation Funding has, in a draft report, called for putting toll booths on Route 95. And key legislators are considering taxing a variety of items now exempt from the state sales tax, such as movie tickets, haircuts and bowling.LiNeBrEaKMaybe all you need to know is that we re talking about taxing duckpins   or that despite new attractions such as  virtual roulette,  the Twin River slot parlor and greyhound track is trying to find ways to avoid virtual bankruptcy. The stakes are high, considering gambling is the third-highest source of state revenue.LiNeBrEaKBut there must have been some good economic news. How about gas prices? In June, the price of regular, self-service gas reached a Rhode Island record high of $4. 12. And now I m paying $1. 64 at the Cumberland Farms down the street. I love it, but it reminds me of the 60-degree winter days that my wife calls  the upside of global warming.  Cheap gas seems to be the upside of economic disaster.LiNeBrEaKPolitically, the year belonged to President-elect Barack Obama. Whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, a maverick or a socialist, there must have been some part of your heart that was warmed by the sight of the first black American to win the White House.LiNeBrEaKAnd there must have been some part of your soul that responded to what Obama said in Chicago about 106-year-old voter Ann Nixon Cooper:  She was born a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn t vote for two reasons   because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin. And tonight, I think about all that she s seen throughout her century in America   the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can t; and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can. LiNeBrEaKIn Rhode Island, Democratic U.S. Sen. Jack Reed cruised to victory over Republican Robert Tingle, a Foxwoods pit boss who ran a virtual campaign against the incumbent, and Democratic U.S. Representatives Patrick J. Kennedy and James R. Langevin trounced their GOP challengers by virtually the same huge margins.LiNeBrEaKIndeed, it was not a good year for most Rhode Island Republicans. The Nov. 4 election nearly cut the number of General Assembly Republicans in half, leaving the GOP with just 10 of 113 seats   believed to be the lowest level in Rhode Island history.LiNeBrEaKMaybe all you need to know is that there are now only four Republicans in the 38-member state Senate and they re split 2-to-2 over who should be the leader of their merry little band.LiNeBrEaKI was sad to see one of my favorite senators lose: Republican Sen. June N. Gibbs, 86, of Middletown, was defeated after 24 years in office. I remember interviewing Gibbs in 2001 about a redistricting map that placed her in a district that included Little Compton, which lies across the Sakonnet River from Middletown.  That s pure gerrymander,  Gibbs said. But, she added,  I can windsurf over there.  And she wasn t kidding.LiNeBrEaKNot all Republicans had a bad year. Allan W. Fung ran away with the Cranston mayoral election, becoming the first Asian-American to be elected mayor in Rhode Island. On election night, hours before Obama talked about a  defining moment  for the country, Fung talked about a  defining moment  for Cranston and Rhode Island.LiNeBrEaKAnd not all Democrats had a good year. Senate President Joseph A. Montalbano, a force in state politics for two decades, was ousted by independent candidate Edward O Neill, a Lincoln resident and retired business executive who had never before held an elected position. On election night, Montalbano attributed the loss to  a message of change out there that has resonated with the people.  But he also appears to have been hurt by an Ethics Commission fine and a redistricting plan that made Lincoln a big chunk of his district.LiNeBrEaKAnother powerful legislator, Senate Finance Chairman Stephen D. Alves was upset by Michael J. Pinga in a close Democratic primary in West Warwick.LiNeBrEaKBut another once-powerful legislator, former Senate President William V. Irons, did have a good year.LiNeBrEaKIrons, who resigned abruptly on the eve of the 2004 legislative session, received word from federal prosecutors that he is no longer a target of the wide-ranging State House influence-peddling probe known as Operation Dollar Bill. The Journal disclosed that Irons, an insurance salesman, had collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions since 1997 on a Blue Cross policy covering CVS workers in Rhode Island, and at the time, Irons chaired a committee that handled health care and voted on legislation of interest to CVS.LiNeBrEaKIn October, a Superior Court judge dismissed ethics charges against Irons, saying the state Ethics Commission can t prosecute him based on his legislative activities because of the  speech-in-debate  clause in the state Constitution. The Ethics Commission has appealed.LiNeBrEaKSpeaking of Operation Dollar Bill, a federal jury in October convicted former Roger Williams Medical Center President Robert A. Urciuoli of corruption charges while acquitting another former hospital executive, Frances P. Driscoll. The verdict came two years after Urciuoli and Driscoll were convicted in a trial in which the verdict was later overturned.LiNeBrEaKSpeaking of convictions, Providence Mayor David N. Cicilline s brother, lawyer John M. Cicilline, went to prison in October for his role in shaking down a drug-dealing couple in Massachusetts for $150,000. And John Cicilline was at the center of another controversy, involving a bounced $75,000 check for a client s delinquent taxes in Providence.LiNeBrEaKSpeaking of Cicilline, the mayor was involved in a high-profile debate with Governor Carcieri over illegal immigration following the arrest of an illegal immigrant charged with kidnapping and raping a woman.LiNeBrEaKSpeaking of Carcieri, the governor signed a six-point executive order in March that he said would enable  a vast array of state government agencies  to address illegal immigration in Rhode Island. Immigration advocates accused him of scapegoating, and Democratic leaders accused him of  mandating racial profiling. LiNeBrEaKIn June, immigration agents swept through stores, apartments and other locations on Aquidneck Island, arresting 42 suspected illegal immigrants. In July, agents entered state courthouses, arresting 31 others, working as janitors. And in August, Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas J. Tobin and 15 pastors took the extraordinary step of calling on immigration agents to  evaluate the morality of their participation in immigration raids. LiNeBrEaKSpeaking of courthouses, the federal courthouse in downtown Providence celebrated its centennial this year. Chief Justice of the United States John G. Roberts Jr. was here for the opening event in February, marking the first time a sitting Supreme Court chief justice has been in Rhode Island on official business in more than two centuries. Another Supreme Court justice, Antonin Scalia, came to the Roger Williams University School of Law in April as part of its  supreme semester. LiNeBrEaKIn July, the Rhode Island Supreme Court brought an abrupt end to the state s nine-year effort to force major corporations to clean up lead-based paint that the state believes poisoned tens of thousands of local children. The court overturned rulings by a Superior Court judge and a jury verdict that found the companies created a public nuisance by making and selling the paint.LiNeBrEaKSupreme Court Chief Justice Frank J. Williams surprised many people by announcing he will resign at year s end. Williams, 68, said he is retiring in part because he has achieved many of his goals. Also earlier this month, District Court Chief Judge Albert E. DeRobbio and Family Court Judge Gilbert T. Rocha died within days of each other.LiNeBrEaKSo all in all, it was a year of change   often dramatic change and not always for the best.LiNeBrEaKSome of us felt like fleeing. Rhode Island was one of just two states to lose population in the latest U.S. Census Bureau estimate. And in Foster, three emus bolted when a pig used its snout to lift a livestock gate off its hinges. (Two returned promptly, but one was on the lam for four weeks.)LiNeBrEaKOne thing that didn t change was our fascination with anything connected to mobsters. You could see that as people gathered in Riverside on a cold November day to watch a backhoe dig up what the state police believe is the body of Joseph P.  Joe Onions  Scanlon, the victim of an infamous 1978 gangland slaying. A family friend said Scanlon got his nickname  because he made the girls cry.  And maybe all you need to know about his death is the tale involves a bullet through the skull, a body in a red Cadillac and a prostitute named Sandra Surprise.LiNeBrEaKLike Joe Onions, 2008 had a bad ending and made some of us cry. In many respects, it will be good to see both of them laid to rest.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 	December 28, 2008 Sunday   Metro Edition	LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  	HORIZON EDITORIAL; Pg. 2  	1251 words  	Why would those who are atheist attend this birthday?LiNeBrEaKThe Dec. 23 article on atheists and Christmas festivities was confusing to me, ("Nonbelievers go through the motions").LiNeBrEaKIf you are Christian, you believe that Christ was born at Christmas and you celebrate the birth, with the exchange of gifts and perhaps a party or family gathering. Gifts are exchanged as a symbol of gifts brought to the Christ child. Atheists, as I have been taught, do not believe in Christ, so why would they join in the celebration?LiNeBrEaKI am not Jewish; I do not celebrate Hanukkah. I am not African; I do not celebrate Kwanza. Why would someone who does not believe in what is being celebrated join?LiNeBrEaKI go to birthday celebrations of friends and bring an appropriate gift, but do not go to birthday celebrations of people I do not know. Why would atheists want to celebrate the birth of someone they do not know or choose to know? Why would friends make them partake of a celebration that has no meaning for that person? LiNeBrEaKAnyone can come to Christ just as they are and learn about what he did for humankind, how to live eternally with God or live eternally separated from God. Every human born will live eternally somewhere, with God or separated from him.LiNeBrEaKRoberta ShoemakerLiNeBrEaKFloydLiNeBrEaKThis has long been a season to celebrateLiNeBrEaKI was surprised to read that atheists find Christmas to be such a drag, ("Nonbelievers go through the motions," Dec. 23 news story).LiNeBrEaKThey and any other non-Christians are surely aware that the holiday that is called Christmas was borrowed from earlier traditions. While Christians celebrate the birth of Christ on Dec. 25, that date was previously celebrated by the Romans as Saturnalia, with partying and gift-giving.LiNeBrEaKSince the earliest of times, various cultures have recognized the winter solstice; the crops are in, we've survived another year, the days will now get longer. Let's light a yule log which, hopefully, will burn for 12 days, decorate an evergreen tree, find some mistletoe and have a party.LiNeBrEaKHappy Holidays, each and every one.LiNeBrEaKGene GalvinLiNeBrEaKRoanokeLiNeBrEaKControlling CO2 would cripple economyLiNeBrEaKThe liberal, progressive Roanoke Times is becoming even more confused as it tries to untangle the religion of human effects on global warming/cooling/climate change.LiNeBrEaKApparently (correctly) concluding that Earth's climate is entering a cooling cycle, the loons now speak only of "climate change" -- as though we have the power to change Earth's orbit or solar activity.LiNeBrEaKSo The Times ignorantly opines on the evils of coal and (more importantly) the coal business, apparently oblivious to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Every industrial facility is required to obtain an NPDES Permit, which requires monitoring, measuring, recording and reporting every discharge. That includes rain gutters and parking lot runoff. Products of coal combustion are strictly controlled, with the exception of carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKHow to cripple the U.S. economy? Make carbon dioxide a pollutant and sign the Kyoto Accords. As for coal combustion particulates, volcanoes, diesel exhaust and wood stoves are larger hazards.LiNeBrEaKLiberal, progressive, socialist Dems need a crisis, so global warming/cooling/change is it. Besides, clean, safe, efficient nuclear power is just too obvious and effective a source of electrical generation for our economy (and those cute little electric cars).LiNeBrEaKEd TrottierLiNeBrEaKMonetaLiNeBrEaKHillsville kennel case should spark outrageLiNeBrEaKIt's the holiday season, but sadly, there has barely been any public outcry against the David Winesett puppy mill case in Hillsville. Perhaps we are all too busy spreading holiday cheer to demand something be done. And if we were to demand action be taken, where are our government officials? Apparently on the ski slopes, for all the attention being paid to this case.LiNeBrEaKWinesett, whose dogs were seized due to deplorable conditions, will have his dogs returned to him on a technicality. The court system was simply too busy to hear the case within the allotted 10 days. What kind of society do we live in when citizens will stand by and let dogs be forced to live in filthy, cramped cages?LiNeBrEaKPlease, I know we are busy with the holidays, but we can each take a moment to phone our state legislators and demand that our animal welfare laws be enforced in Virginia.LiNeBrEaKLynn ChipkinLiNeBrEaKIndian ValleyLiNeBrEaKForget cigarette tax; tax gasoline insteadLiNeBrEaKThe proposal by Governor Kaine to impose a 30 cent per pack tax increase on cigarettes is an attempt to place the burden of the budget shortfall on the shoulders of a small percentage of the state populace in the form of a sin tax.LiNeBrEaKA more equitable way to solve this problem would be a 5 cent per gallon tax increase on gasoline. This should not only help solve our "budget crisis," but in the long haul, also provide enough money to fix our highway system.LiNeBrEaKThe 30 cent per pack increase on cigarettes would cost the average smoker $3 per week or more. A 5 cent per gallon increase on gasoline would cost the average driver $2 per month or less.LiNeBrEaKAll one has to do is travel into any of our bordering states and notice the cost of gas is higher. It's not because Virginia is loaded with oil fields, but because other states already have higher gas taxes than ours.LiNeBrEaKA tax increase on gasoline should also pacify those in need of another "sin" tax, (see: global warming.)LiNeBrEaKDavid GerowLiNeBrEaKSalemLiNeBrEaKPolice officers had right to honor fallen comradeLiNeBrEaKIn response to "Honoring a slain dog was a waste," (Dec. 21 letter), I think Karl Kroemer should rethink his position on this matter.LiNeBrEaKI feel that the dog was a fallen comrade and he died in the line of duty. He is the point man (or dog) to enter a property when the situation is unknown.LiNeBrEaKIf Kroemer thinks it was a waste, I would like him to be the point man when my house is robbed. He can go see what criminal lurks around the corners armed with semiautomatics and respond faithfully and with courage to disarm the bandit, no questions asked. And as for the officers traveling for this funeral, I think that they deserve time off to mourn like anyone else.LiNeBrEaKI hurt for that K9, a friend, a family member, and an outstanding officer injured by accident.LiNeBrEaKGilbert L.

Sewell's letter, "Blinders are needed to deny evolution," (Dec. 22).LiNeBrEaKThere is a common misperception that you cannot have faith and be a true scientist. Yet science is following where the evidence leads, regardless of where you want it to point and the implications. Former journalist Lee Strobel says in "The Case for a Creator," "I see faith as being a reasonable step in the same direction that the evidence is pointing."LiNeBrEaKTake a look at the complexity of nature and of the human body; could it have arisen by chance? The complexity of life points to a designer, not an undirected evolutionary process. It takes more faith to believe in evolution than to believe that life came from where the evidence points: to an intelligent designer.LiNeBrEaKLaurel C.

The nation walks away with another billion dollar loss today and every day for years.LiNeBrEaKIf this were me, I wouldn't go back to that table and would save the billion dollars every day.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 28, 2008 Sunday   FINAL Edition	Moving toward adulthood in 2009?  	Op-Ed; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR; Pg. G2  	802 words  	Editor - Boundaries help us. They differentiate us. They keep us safe. They order our experience. They define us, but they also confine, isolate, limit and alienate us. Perhaps 2008 has been such a terrifying and exhilarating year because virtually all of our boundaries have been assaulted, breeched and broken. LiNeBrEaKThe ecological challenges of our planet refuse to be contained by political boundaries, or even by the lines between land and sea. Our country's place in the world has become a more humble one as we failed to be bound by our own values in the war on terror, or distinguished by industrial pre-eminence in the global economy.  LiNeBrEaKWe struggle with the boundaries between citizens and residents. We fight over social boundaries that dictate who may marry. We crashed through racial boundaries in the election of a black president. At the same time, we wrestle with what it means to be human, when life begins, how it can be created and genetically altered and when it can be terminated. LiNeBrEaKSimple boundaries like property lines have been breached by foreclosures. Walls exclude willing workers from shrinking workplaces. Jobs cannot be contained within our borders. The shapes of boundaries between the haves and have-nots and the have-less are continually morphing. The illusory boundaries isolating the famous are dissipated by ordinary people's 15 minutes of fame. LiNeBrEaKInformation, no longer confined within the walls of a building or between the covers of a book, is ubiquitous. However, the same technology that feeds our minds assaults the traditional boundaries of privacy and personal space. Exploration into outer space continues to point to unimaginable worlds beyond our own while nanotechnology harnesses the infinitely small. The boundaries separating traditional disciplines are bridged by hyphenated fields such as bioengineering and psycholinguistics. LiNeBrEaKIt is not surprising we have been at loose ends this year. It has been an anxious, growing, ungainly time. It is my hope that future generations mark 2008 as the year we began a serious shift in the way we perceive and create boundaries, moving from exclusion to inclusion, seeing the interconnectedness of all things and taking our first tentative steps out of the protective walls of adolescence into planetary adulthood.

Buy Obama! But I hope that he can't really be bought. We chose him for change, so he'd better not change too much. LiNeBrEaKOf all the inspiring words that he's said, these are the ones I most hope are true: "We are a better country than this."LiNeBrEaK"We are better than these last eight years."LiNeBrEaKWe are better than the leader who should have been impeached and removed from office instead of targeted with a pair of shoes. We are better than a stampede of frenzied shoppers observing every holiday by spending money we don't have on merchandise we don't need.LiNeBrEaKWhen Obama was elected, I got congratulatory messages from friends in France, Germany, Spain, Japan and Tonga. In Tonga, where I went for the king's coronation last August, I saw a flyer with a picture of Obama right next to the commemorative stamps of the coronation: "US President Obama? Good for Tonga?" I hope we've gotten a president who is good for the United States, Tonga and the rest of the world. I'd like us to be part of the rest of the world, not those who invade and occupy.LiNeBrEaKTINA MARTIN LiNeBrEaKSan Francisco LiNeBrEaKCity memoryLiNeBrEaKEditor - As the year 2008 comes to a close, I relive a fond memory. I traveled to your fine city by the bay on Aug. 2 and awoke very early the following morning to compete in the 2008 San Francisco Marathon. I surely did not win. I also did not lose. I did have the experience of a lifetime. All competitors of this challenge were winners on that beautiful San Francisco Sunday morning. LiNeBrEaKThe reason that a guy from Pittsburgh chose your great city for this task was simple. If I had to endure such a grueling amount of preparation, practice and time to compete in a marathon, I might as well have done it in the greatest city in the world. LiNeBrEaKThe joy and sense of accomplishment that I felt at the end of the race was only heightened by finding my loved ones lining the Embarcadero. The rest of the week was grand, the food was divine, the hospitality was warm. The experience of a lifetime in a city I continue to love.LiNeBrEaKJONATHAN CAROTHERS LiNeBrEaKPittsburgh 	EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); GLOBALIZATION (75%); IRAQ WAR (72%); FORECLOSURE (72%); GLOBAL WARMING (71%); SPACE EXPLORATION (71%); WAR and CONFLICT (70%); SPACE INDUSTRY (69%); BIOTECHNOLOGY and GENETIC SCIENCE (68%); GENETIC ENGINEERING (67%); APPLIED LINGUISTICS (63%); LINGUISTICS (63%); NANOTECHNOLOGY (50%); US PRESIDENTS (73%) INSIGHT; LETTER; YEAREND  	BARACK OBAMA (81%)  	EARTH (92%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) IRAQ (79%); AFGHANISTAN (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); TONGA (79%)  	December 28, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved  																						
San Bernardino County Sun (California) 	December 28, 2008 Sunday 	Make I.E. nation's green energy center  	OPINION  	788 words  	The Inland Empire, including the cities of San Bernardino and Riverside, have been severely impacted by the housing crisis, and have unemployment figures much higher than the national average. The core of the local economy used to be a Kaiser steel mill and the Norton and March Air Force bases. Unemployment today in the area is 10 percent, and one in 8 homes is in foreclosure. These numbers are even higher in the city centers in San Bernardino and Riverside, based on a study released by Sen. Barbara Boxer.LiNeBrEaKOur region is a dusty, smoggy part of the state which has, until now, drawn in sprawling residential developments and corporate goods distribution hubs. We consequently have few industries that create jobs, and a disproportionate health impact from containerized traffic flowing on our roadways and railways. LiNeBrEaKWith the depth of the economic crisis here, I see an opportunity to make the inland Southern California region a poster child for a dramatic renewal along the lines of a green economic renewal. There are opportunities to demonstrate dramatic reversals in our current environmentally unfriendly economic structure. The opportunity is to demonstrate that even the most polluting industries, like railways, container transportation on trucks, and housing sprawl, can be re-engineered to make a measurable reversal of global warming and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.LiNeBrEaKThere are several educational research centers that could become the focal points of economic activity in the region. Each of these schools has unique strengths that would lead to a cluster-based approach towards green industry. The California coastal economy has been powered by investments in education technology. Where Silicon Valley is the center for computer innovation and San Diego is a biotechnology powerhouse, the Inland Empire has the educational framework in place to become the green energy research center of the country. This would also promote the goal of equity of educational access to an extremely diverse population that reflects the future of America. LiNeBrEaKThe University of California's Riverside campus has a technology program called the Center for Environmental Research and Technology. Its strengths are in electric vehicle research and biomass conversion technology. Cal Poly Pomona has advanced research in regenerative environmental processes, among other fields of study in environmental studies. The University of Redlands (my alma mater) has a Center for Environmental Management (CEM) which has strengths in GIS (geographical information systems) and other environmental modeling technologies. Redlands is also the world headquarters for ESRI (where I work) which is the world leader in geospatial engineering and conservation technology.LiNeBrEaKLoma Linda University has a world-renowned program in cancer research and medical gene therapy. It also has a strong research program in environmental studies that does work in solar energy research. Cal State San Bernardino has a program that addresses commercialization of technology. The award-winning MBA in entrepreneurship is focused towards the green economy.LiNeBrEaKIt is feasible to articulate the vision for economic renewal in the Inland Empire based on substantial investments in education and research at these institutes and others to provide a qualified workforce for the green economy. Local elected officials already are working on such initiatives; the Green Valley Initiative aims to prepare the region for a green economy. In the east valley, a draft proposal by the mayor of Redlands details the possible ways in which Redlands can contribute toward a green renewal.LiNeBrEaKInvestments in research and human capital in the Inland Empire would put us on a path to establish equality of economic and educational opportunity for all residents in California. The inequality between the coastal counties and the Inland region is exhibited in terms of jobs, education opportunities and quality of life. The universities in the region have large populations of minority students. Making the Inland Empire the center for this green economy would show that opportunity for advancement and education is available to all Americans.LiNeBrEaKAt recent "Change is Coming" house meetings in Redlands and San Bernardino, a large number of attendees put green economy and sustainable development at the top of their list of priorities for this country. The president-elect's plan to use green economic renewal to produce jobs and also reduce our dependence on foreign oil is very well received here, and local supporters stand ready to work with local officials and our representatives in Congress to implement this agenda for change in our community.LiNeBrEaKJonathan Abraham is a resident of Redlands.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	December 28, 2008 Sunday 	Palo Alto developer recruits business owners for climate fight  	BREAKING; Communities; Peninsula; News; Local; Lifestyle  	535 words  	As Palo Alto works toward the city council's ambitious goal of reducing citywide emissions by 15 percent from 2005 levels, it's getting a push from a local developer who believes small businesses, collectively, can make a big difference.LiNeBrEaKJim Baer, chief executive of Premier Properties, believes going green tends to be relatively easy for governments and big companies, which can hire consultants and implement sweeping plans, and private citizens, who can simply change their personal habits. But organizing small- and medium-sized businesses around climate change goals is tougher, because there are so many of them but none is large enough to make much of an impact on its own. LiNeBrEaKIt's not that they don't want to make their operations cleaner and more efficient, Baer said. It's just that they're not always sure the best way to go about it.LiNeBrEaKEnter Wave One, the initiative he launched in May to enlist banks, architects, real estate agents and other small firms in the fight against global warming. Instead of expecting each to find its own way toward saving energy, Baer's plan is to organize them into clusters that can all take the same measures at the same time.LiNeBrEaKBaer launched the project with a goal of getting 25 businesses per month to reduce their water and energy use, enroll in the Palo Alto Green program and become certified as green businesses. He has already hired three part-time staff members, teamed up with the Palo Alto-based environmental group Acterra to gain nonprofit status, and lined up some 75 business owners willing to participate.LiNeBrEaKThe interest has been so strong, he said, that the goal of 25 per month might end up being conservative.LiNeBrEaK"Right now there's the willingness of businesses, the good intentions of businesses, but when they decide to contact the city our the county or a nonprofit to help them, it's random access," he said. "That inevitably creates inefficiencies."LiNeBrEaKEliminate the randomness, however, and the process becomes smoother.LiNeBrEaK"If we're organizing the light auditors for 10 businesses on Emerson Street on the same day, or the replacement of 10 lights for businesses downtown, then it's efficient," Baer said.LiNeBrEaKPalo Alto insurance agent Jeri Fink was one of the first to sign up and has already had her business evaluated. She said the auditors' advice has shown her that becoming a green business doesn't have to be daunting or complicated.LiNeBrEaK"That's the biggest thing   is they're there to guide you," Fink said of Wave One. "Otherwise a lot of people won't make the effort."LiNeBrEaKMayor Larry Klein called Wave One an "exciting idea" that could be instrumental in helping the city meet its climate targets.LiNeBrEaK"We need things like that," he said. "We're not going to get anywhere in the fight against global warming without people participating in a lot of different ways. We can't just depend on the government."LiNeBrEaKIf it works in Palo Alto, Baer said, Wave One could become a model for cities nationwide. In fact, that's the genesis of the project's name.LiNeBrEaK"We view this as an intensified pilot program," he said. "We're just the first wave of a thousand waves. We have to have the business community organize itself to make this happen."LiNeBrEaKE-mail Will Oremus at woremus@dailynewsgroup.com	EMISSIONS (90%); SMALL BUSINESS (90%); REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT (90%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (89%); CITIES (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); MAYORS (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); REAL ESTATE AGENTS (72%); REAL ESTATE (72%); CONSULTING SERVICES (71%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (70%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (69%); INSURANCE (67%)  			December 29, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 San Jose Mercury News All Rights Reserved  	By Will Oremus Bay Area News Group  																					
Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN) 	December 28, 2008 Sunday   Metro Edition	Readers Write  	NEWS; Opinion Exchange; Pg. 2OP  	902 words  	LETTER OF THE DAY: For once, a story of charity and selflessness on the front pageLiNeBrEaKConsidering the stunning greed that has recently been exhibited by the Wall Street CEOs, it is truly heartwarming to read about the anonymous philanthropist who came to the rescue of the Burnsville apartment fire victims.LiNeBrEaKI'm sure I speak for many when I say "thank you" to this unbelievably generous individual. By helping these unfortunate few, you have helped many more of us to recapture our sorely tried belief in basic human goodness. LiNeBrEaKJAN WOLFF, BloomingtonLiNeBrEaKTHE SENATE RACELiNeBrEaKCall it a tie, and let's move onLiNeBrEaKOut of 2. 4 million votes cast in the Minnesota U.S. Senate race, a little over 6,000 have been reconsidered. The rest were apparently just fine.LiNeBrEaKThat means that our election was 99. 75 percent accurate. An error rate of 0. 25 percent (which is on the high side since not all the challenged votes were changed) is impressive.LiNeBrEaKIn this case, however, the margin of victory was only 0. 02 percent. Statistically, that's really a tie, too close to call within the margin of error.LiNeBrEaKDoesn't a runoff election make better sense than a recount when an election is this close? Too expensive? Then how about a coin toss? Why not? It's clearly a tossup among the voters. Flipping a coin is fair, apolitical and not subject to endless court challenges.LiNeBrEaKSTEVEN BLONS, MINNEAPOLISLiNeBrEaKCHASM IN THE CHURCHLiNeBrEaKWe need to take politics out from behind the pulpitLiNeBrEaKWe need more priests like the Rev. Michael Tegeder, who is interested in decreasing ill will between groups with differing religious opinions ("Church plans for mass mailing on abortion bill are ill-advised," Dec. 23).LiNeBrEaKHow interesting that his insightful commentary appeared on the same day it was announced that the pope's Christmas letter tells the faithful that ridding the world of homosexuality is as important as handling global warming! Shades of warning the faithful against the dangerous teaching of Galileo that the earth resolves around the sun instead of vice versa.LiNeBrEaKMARY JO MEADOW, FOREST LAKELiNeBrEaKAN ACT OF KINDNESSLiNeBrEaKA sincere thank you to a Good SamaritanLiNeBrEaKMy dad was flying from Buffalo to Sioux City, via Detroit, on Dec. 15. He's an old guy who limps a bit and uses a cane or a walking stick. When he was boarding the plane in Detroit for the trip to Minneapolis, a flight attendant stopped him as he made his way back to Row 17. She said that his seat was being changed to Row 4. The man who had purchased the first-class seat had seen my dad limping in the airport and thought he might enjoy the extra leg room.LiNeBrEaKMy dad was able to thank this man for his generosity only via the flight attendant, and he was not able to learn this man's name. Therefore, I am acknowledging him the only way I can -- via a letter to the editor.LiNeBrEaKI hope my message reaches him. I am so grateful for considerate people and especially consider any act of kindness to my father as a particular blessing. May we all be so lucky as to find ourselves surrounded by people with such generosity and humanity, and may we all realize our ability to become such people ourselves. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.LiNeBrEaKPAULA BAUER, VALLEJO, CALIF.LiNeBrEaKPAWLENTY'S ADMONITIONLiNeBrEaKGovernment sometimes is part of the familyLiNeBrEaKWhen he announced budget cuts, Gov. Tim Pawlenty said, "Families across Minnesota are tightening their belts, and they expect government to do the same" (Star Tribune, Dec. 20). That implies families and government are separate entities, maybe even in conflict with each other.LiNeBrEaKHardly. Many families are supported by jobs that parents have working for the state, and those workers provide services for other families. In most ways, the government really is about families.LiNeBrEaKPawlenty's statement actually reflects an attitude he's shown frequently, that "government" is a pawn to be used for his own purposes. In this case, his purpose is to convince "families" that he's watching their collective back. He would be a little more convincing if he were to announce a substantial cut in his own salary.LiNeBrEaKJIM BARTOS, BROOKLYN PARKLiNeBrEaKMPR'S LRT OBJECTIONSLiNeBrEaKWhere's its liberalism when it matters?LiNeBrEaKWith Minnesota Public Radio's glorious stand in favor of purity of sound and against light-rail transit on Cedar Avenue in St. Paul, we find that the oft-repeated slur is true after all: MPR is a nest of limousine liberals!LiNeBrEaKTHOS.

CLOUDLiNeBrEaKSNOW EMERGENCIESLiNeBrEaKIf you get towed, you weren't paying attentionLiNeBrEaKI'm tired of constantly hearing complaints about being towed during snow emergencies. I moved from Minneapolis a number of years ago, but I had enough intelligence at that time to be aware of parking regulations.LiNeBrEaKThe other day I had to go to an address in south Minneapolis, which required me to park on a snow emergency route during an emergency. It took me about 30 seconds to find out where I could park.LiNeBrEaKPeople can check online, listen to radio or TV or look out the window to see where people park. What's the problem? How can anybody be complaining about being towed during a snow emergency?LiNeBrEaKCome on, people -- pay a little attention.

It's common sense --the same with global warming."LiNeBrEaKThe reason for going with the 98 is not only that they are the large majority but also because the risk of ignoring their diagnosis is so much greater than the risk of following the advice to do nothing.

In the preface to that book he writes: "That humanity has caused a substantial rise in atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels over the past centuries, thereby contributing to global warming, is beyond debate.

No one --not Al Gore, not the world's leading scientists and most of all not myself --claims to have all the knowledge and all the solutions. But we have to act on the best available data from both the natural and the social sciences."LiNeBrEaKLomborg is a critic of the Kyoto Protocol and what he calls the "command-and-control" or severe regulatory approach to dealing with this problem. He urges us to take a long-term approach to dealing with a long-term problem, one that emphasizes new technologies and steps to increase the health of the global economy along with the environment so that we can better deal with the effects of climate change.LiNeBrEaKMany of Lomborg's views are controversial, and I don't subscribe to all of his analyses. He minimizes the effect even small increases in average global temperature will have on weather patterns and the geographic distribution of heat, rain, wind and the like. Lomborg also has a reputation for playing fast and loose with the facts, selectively citing studies that support his theses without much regard for their reliability or the existence of contradictory studies or research.LiNeBrEaKStill, his overall concept has merit. Our challenge is both to reduce our contribution to global warming (primarily by reducing CO"LiNeBrEaKUNMAPPED FIELD subs_0 = "LOOKUP"LiNeBrEaKUNMAPPED FIELD subs_1 = "2"LiNeBrEaKUNMAPPED FIELD subs_2 = "emissions) and also to prepare ourselves to deal with the climate change that is already more or less certain to occur. While the first may seem to require us to curtail the growth of the global economy, the latter argues for a richer, stronger economy with a higher standard of living. Thomas Friedman calls this trying to "avoid the unmanageable and manage the unavoidable."LiNeBrEaKThat leaves plenty of room to argue how best to accomplish these twin goals and what trade-offs are necessary or desirable. But before we even get to that argument we must get past the dispute over whether global warming is real and whether we have a responsibility to do something about it.LiNeBrEaKLike it or not, global warming is on the agenda, and it is near the top.

The Sunday Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	December 28, 2008 Sunday   Sunrise Edition	PGE confronts a dirty dilemma  	Business; Pg. a01  	2179 words  	SUMMARY: Amid rising calls for clean energy, the utility weighsLiNeBrEaKclosing vs. improving its coal-fired Boardman plantLiNeBrEaKPGE confronts a dirty dilemma at Boardman Amid rising calls for clean energy, the utility weighs closing vs. improving its coal-fired plant PGE confrontsLiNeBrEaKa dirty dilemma Future costs ofLiNeBrEaKcutting carbonLiNeBrEaKare unknown Carbon high LiNeBrEaKon the agendaLiNeBrEaKfor politiciansLiNeBrEaKTED SICKINGERLiNeBrEaKIt's a blustery day in late November, and 150 miles east of Portland a digital readout in the control room at the Boardman Generating Station is pegged at 597 megawatts.LiNeBrEaKOperating at full throttle, the power plant inhales 330 tons of pulverized coal dust an hour. That's nearly three rail cars worth --stripped from open pit seams in Wyoming's Powder River Basin --every hour, almost every day, every year.LiNeBrEaKInside the plant's 260-foot-tall furnace, 32 flamethrowing burners ignite the cloud of talcum-size coal particles into a roiling, 3,000-degree ball of noxious gases and ash.LiNeBrEaKLike a miniature sun, the ongoing eruption creates enough energy to power 280,000 homes served by the plant's part owner and operator, Portland General Electric. It's 19th-century technology. But it's reliable and cheap.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, its also dirty. Very dirty.LiNeBrEaKAll of which leaves PGE, its 814,000 ratepayers and the public a stark choice between economics and the environment: Should they spend hundreds of millions of dollars --perhaps more than a billion eventually --to keep the old workhorse going, albeit with a smaller stream of the pollutants that belch from its 656-foot stack today? Or would it be better to shut the plant now, eliminating the largest stationary source of air pollution in the state, but leaving its largest utility more dependent on natural gas and its customers exposed to higher, more volatile rates?LiNeBrEaKIt's no longer an academic exercise. In early December, the Department of Environmental Quality issued draft rules that would force PGE to spend $472 million over the next decade to reduce haze-causing emissions from the plant --an investment that would raise rates by 3 percent.LiNeBrEaKBoardman's power is so cheap today that it can probably absorb those costs and remain financially viable. But the equipment would do nothing to reduce Boardman's enormous output of carbon dioxide, the main man-made culprit in global warming.LiNeBrEaKThat bill is still to come and, to a great extent, unknown. Neither the regulations nor the technologies to reduce carbon emissions are fully developed. The cost of either, however, could rival or exceed the price of haze controls at the plant.LiNeBrEaKThe reckoning is coming quickly, most experts say. Climate change was front and center in the presidential campaign, and it's at the core of Gov. Ted Kulongoski's agenda next year.LiNeBrEaKFor many experts, the Boardman dilemma echoes an earlier PGE debacle, the Trojan nuclear plant, which left ratepayers major costs after it was shuttered in 1993.LiNeBrEaK"The worst thing possible for ratepayers would be to spend a half billion dollars, then to have them turn around and close this because of carbon constraints," said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board of Oregon.LiNeBrEaKHooked on coalLiNeBrEaKNorthwesterners love to boast about all the cheap, clean hydroelectric power generated in the region. But the dirty little secret is that coal-fired power plants still provide 40 percent of Oregon's electricity --about the same percentage as hydro.LiNeBrEaKNationwide, coal's contribution is closer to half. And many experts see little prospect of that changing. The United States, after all, is the Saudi Arabia of coal, with adequate reserves for the next 300 years. And coal-fired electricity is one-half to two-thirds cheaper than burning natural gas.LiNeBrEaKBoardman is the state's lone coal-fired plant, but Oregonians consume plenty of power generated at coal plants in Utah, Wyoming and Montana. Some are owned by PacifiCorp, which serves two-thirds of its customers' needs with coal. But independently owned coal plants are also important sources of wholesale power purchases.LiNeBrEaKEvery week, Boardman consumes four to five freight trains worth of coal --each 115 cars long. The trains move constantly between Boardman and Wyoming, and often roll into the coal yard with a few hobos who hopped the wrong train south. After making sure they're not about to bury someone alive, plant operators bulldoze the cargo over the 40 acre-yard, where PGE has laid in a five-month fuel supply --more than a million tons of jet-black, low-sulfur coal.LiNeBrEaKPGE customers consume 65 percent of Boardman's output, which makes up about 25 percent of the utility's generation and 15 percent of its overall demand.LiNeBrEaKBut that number understates Boardman's importance to the utility. Ever since PGE closed Trojan, it has been heavily dependent on open-market purchases of power. This year, it will buy 25 percent of the electricity its customers consume. That's expected to grow to 33 percent in the next decade as the region's population increases and a number of its long-term contracts for power expire.LiNeBrEaKIf Boardman closes, PGE will be deeper in the hole.LiNeBrEaKBoardman also is PGE's cheapest source of power. Other plants go off line when demand wanes or the price of energy in the open market drops to low levels. But Boardman typically runs flat out, continually pumping energy into the power grid and pollutants into the sky.LiNeBrEaKTarget on PGE's backLiNeBrEaKBoardman's emissions have been controversial since it opened in 1980, but the debate has never been louder.LiNeBrEaKEither PGE needs to commit to Boardman, spending heaps of ratepayer dollars to keep the plant chugging, or close it and live with the consequences: a much greater dependence on natural gas with all the price volatility that entails.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental and conservation groups aren't waiting on regulators. They filed a lawsuit this past fall that contends Boardman should have been subject to more stringent air quality rules from its 1980 opening and should have installed updated controls when modified to increase its output over the years.LiNeBrEaK"It's clear that the DEQ hasn't properly implemented the Clean Air Act," said Michael Lang, conservation director with Friends of the Columbia Gorge. "What we've seen is a pattern that DEQ has been more interested in protecting polluters than protecting air quality."LiNeBrEaKPGE and regulators insist Boardman was grandfathered because construction began before clean air regulations were finalized. Moreover, they say, modifications to the plant never triggered new pollution controls because Boardman's emissions didn't increase beyond permitted levels.LiNeBrEaKEither way, all sides agree that under new haze-reduction rules, PGE must radically reduce Boardman's output of oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, not to mention mercury. To do so, PGE would have to install $472 million worth of equipment by 2017.LiNeBrEaKFactor in inflation and finance costs, and PGE figures the cost could balloon to more than $700 million.LiNeBrEaKThe catch: The equipment will do nothing to control carbon dioxide. That's hundreds of millions extra.LiNeBrEaKKulongoski has made carbon limits a centerpiece of the environmental regulations he is pitching for the next Legislature. And President-elect Barack Obama has called for a national system that would reduce overall emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.LiNeBrEaKIt's not clear how the lawmaking will play out, but most experts assume carbon limits are inevitable and that industrial polluters could eventually face steep costs --from $10 to $70 --for every ton of carbon dioxide they emit. For a plant like Boardman, whose stack spews 5 million tons of carbon dioxide every year, that translates to between $50 million and $350 million annually.LiNeBrEaKPGE has runs its own numbers on Boardman's future viability but isn't ready to unveil them publicly.LiNeBrEaK"It's not just carbon regulations. We don't know what gas prices will be, what coal prices will do," said Jim Piro, who takes over as PGE's chief executive this week. "If everything was known and knowable, it would be an easy analysis."LiNeBrEaKInside Piro's worldLiNeBrEaKPiro is no global-warming denier. But like many in his industry, he's convinced that renewables and energy efficiencies can't meet all the power demands of Northwest consumers. So-called clean coal will play a crucial role, he says.LiNeBrEaK"With the drive and the research dollars, I think scientists can figure some of this stuff out," he said of cleaner coal technology.LiNeBrEaKHis industry is betting on it. The utilities and mining industries nationwide have mounted a major public relations campaign around clean coal. The phrase was invoked incessantly by Democratic and Republican candidates during the election campaign.LiNeBrEaKThe concept refers to technology to capture and store carbon dioxide from burning coal by pumping it underground or undersea.LiNeBrEaKDespite the hype, however, clean coal is little more than a science project today. It's still not clear it's possible, much less cost-effective, to separate, concentrate and inject large volumes of carbon dioxide underground, and make sure it stays there.LiNeBrEaKExecutives from coal-dependent PacifiCorp, which has an even bigger carbon problem looming than PGE, suggest that carbon capture and storage won't be available until 2025 and will probably raise coal plant capital costs by 40 to 50 percent. Retrofitting an existing plant, if geology in the surrounding area is even suitable for carbon storage, also would knock out 10 to 15 percent of a plant's output.LiNeBrEaKPiro says that if carbon storage is too expensive, or if customers and regulators determine Boardman needs to close, they'll have to deal with the tradeoff. Right now, he says, that means natural gas.LiNeBrEaK"I'm not excited about being more dependent on natural gas, which would expose us to more volatility, but that's the next step we'd have to take," he said. "We'd have to build a gas plant out there."LiNeBrEaKThe Pacific Environmental Advocacy Center, which is suing PGE on behalf of a coalition of groups that want to shut the Boardman plant, has hired its own consultant to look at potential alternatives, such as renewables and energy efficiency .LiNeBrEaK"My clients really believe the prudent thing to do is to figure out how to replace this plant now rather than later," said Aubrey Baldwin, a lawyer with PEAC.LiNeBrEaKWhat customers thinkLiNeBrEaKPGE customers are clear about what they want --until they consider the price.LiNeBrEaKIn the fall of 2005, PGE hired market research firm Kema to survey customers' perspectives on a wide range of energy resource options.LiNeBrEaKCustomers had strong opinions. A majority thought PGE should meet its power needs with domestically generated, sustainable resources and avoid anything likely to be exhausted in the next 20 to 30 years.LiNeBrEaKWind and energy efficiency ranked first with customers, and coal and nuclear ranked last. In fact, they thought renewables and conservation should make up 50 to 60 percent of future energy acquisitions.LiNeBrEaKFrom Piro's seat, that's a tall order. Shunning resources likely to be exhausted in 20 to 30 years could mean avoiding Canadian natural gas --the most obvious resource choice if PGE quits using coal. Energy efficiency is cost-effective, but before the company is willing to pursue it wholeheartedly, it wants a rate structure in place that doesn't penalize it for persuading customers to use less of its product.LiNeBrEaKPGE, Piro contends, is already adding renewables as fast as it can. Last year it opened its first wind farm, the $255 million Biglow Canyon, where it will spend $770 million to expand capacity in the next two years. It recently issued a request for bids on another big chunk of renewables, and will have to continue spending heavily to meet the state mandate of serving 25 percent of its retail demand with renewables by 2025.LiNeBrEaKStill, only 4 percent of PGE's electricity comes from renewables today, and the company says it can't add wind power indefinitely without harming the reliability of its power supply.LiNeBrEaK"Anyone who thinks we can power the entire system with renewables . . . unless there's some new renewable I'm not aware of, that's not doable right now," Piro said.LiNeBrEaKIn one way, PGE's customers have already voted on their willingness to pay more for green power. The company's Green Source program allows customers to purchase 100 percent of their electricity from renewable sources. It costs about 10 percent extra to do so.LiNeBrEaKOnly 8 percent of PGE's customers have signed up for it.LiNeBrEaKMixed messages from customers aside, the future of Boardman will play out in a series of policy discussions between PGE and its regulators --or perhaps in court. Conservation and tribal groups are adamant about avoiding further delay. Every day the plant operates without modern pollution controls, they say, is another day of foul air, poisoned fish and public heath risks.LiNeBrEaKPiro says PGE is willing to shut Boardman if regulators conclude that's financially prudent. But PGE would like to put off any decision, and any big expenditures, for as long as possible.LiNeBrEaK"The more time we can buy, the more information we'll have," Piro said. "We're in uncharted territory on a lot of this analysis."LiNeBrEaKTed Sickinger: 503-221-8505; tedsickinger@news.oregonian.com	POWER PLANTS (90%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (90%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); SOLAR ENERGY (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); AIR POLLUTION (78%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (78%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (69%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (69%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (69%); RIVERS (68%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (58%)  	TED KULONGOSKI (50%)  	PORTLAND, OR, USA (72%) OREGON, USA (92%); WYOMING, USA (91%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 29, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Sunday Oregonian All Rights Reserved  	TED SICKINGER, The Oregonian  					NAICS221122 ELECTRIC POWER DISTRIBUTION (58%); NAICS221121 ELECTRIC BULK POWER TRANSMISSION and CONTROL (58%); SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES (58%)  			POR (NYSE) (58%)  	PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC CO (58%)  												
Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	December 28, 2008 Sunday   Final Edition	Official says state crafting own greenhouse gas plan  	News; Pg. A16  	848 words  	Oklahoma does not have a "climate action plan" to address global warming, but a top environmental official maintains that the state is at the forefront of reducing its carbon output because of its advances in the alternative fuel and wind industries. "We decided to focus our resources on more practical measures that enable Oklahoma to position itself as a leader in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions," said Oklahoma Secretary of the Environment J.D. Strong. Harlan Hentges, the legal counsel for the Oklahoma Sustainability Network, has another take on why the state isn't pursuing a specific plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: "Oklahoma is following its leaders, and some of them have taken the position that climate change isn't real and isn't caused by human beings and you can't do anything about it." Thirty-two states have a climate action plan or one in the works to address their state's contributions to global warming in anticipation of federal regulations on greenhouse gases in the near future.  LiNeBrEaKThose plans recommend policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Some policies, such as educating homeowners on how to use energy more efficiently, are not quantified. But many other policy recommendations are quantified for their estimated greenhouse gas reduction as well as the projected cost savings. Arkansas, for example, estimates reducing greenhouse gases by 58. 9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2025 with the addition of nuclear power. Oklahoma is among 18 states, including Texas, that are not being assisted by the Center for Climate Strategies. Strong said, "It was one path of many that states could take to demonstrate their desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and have a positive impact on global warming; it's certainly not the only way to get there. "Our preference so far has been to see what kind of regulatory caps we're going to have at the national level, and, in the meantime, take interim steps to reduce our carbon in the state." Gov. Brad Henry's Oklahoma Bioenergy Center is set to become a national leader in biofuel research, Strong said. Perhaps most promising is switchgrass, a perennial native grass that was once abundant on Oklahoma's tallgrass prairies. Researchers believe that ethanol derived from switchgrass is much more efficient than corn-produced ethanol. A switchgrass crop pulls carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, is disease-resistant and can thrive under poor growing conditions. Hentges, however, said that switchgrass has a long way to go before it becomes a usable fuel. "The economy of Oklahoma is built on burning fossil fuels," he said. "Any policy to address climate change would require them to do a lot of new things, and they don't want anybody to force them to do these things." Strong said tax incentives to help spur Oklahoma's wind energy industry would help catapult the state to the forefront of the wind energy industry. The U.S. Department of Energy predicts that Oklahoma will the second-largest producer of wind energy by 2030. It current rank is No. 10, according to the American Wind Energy Association. Those states with climate action plans support emissions reporting, cap-and-trade programs and low-emission standards for fuels, vehicles and appliances. Oklahoma has participated in a greenhouse gas inventory, which shows that emissions increased by 22 percent from 1990 to 1999. Carbon dioxide, the byproduct of burning fossil fuels, was the biggest contributor, representing 72 percent of the greenhouse gases in 1990 and 70 percent in 1999. Coal-fired power plants are the biggest source of carbon dioxide emissions. Government energy statistics show that coal has the highest carbon content, and natural gas has the lowest. Strong said natural gas plants may come more into play if pollution control technology at coal-fired plants proves to be cost-prohibitive. Strong said American Electric Power-Public Service Company of Oklahoma would test its carbon-capture technology next year at its coal-fired plant in West Virginia. The carbon would be stored underground or used for enhanced oil-recovery activities. The technology will be initiated at AEP-PSO's operation in Oologah in late 2011. "We recognize that it's really inevitable that we're going to see climate change regulation at the national level," Strong said. "You're talking a global problem. We really expect the next Congress to pass legislation that will set hard caps on how much carbon can be emitted." Another measure to reduce carbon is the Oklahoma Corporation Commission's adoption of "demand side management" rules, which Strong said is the first step in regulating energy efficiency of the utilities they regulate. "The idea is for utilities to not just earn a profit from the amount of electrons they sell, but to earn some profit from selling less electricity and helping customers become more efficient," Strong said.
