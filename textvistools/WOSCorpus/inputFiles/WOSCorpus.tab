Previously we demonstrated the activity of 2As (and 2A-like sequences) within a wide range of animal RNA virus genomes and non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons (non-LTRs) in the genomes of the unicellular organisms Trypanosoma brucei (Ingi) and T. cruzi (L1Tc). Here, we report the presence of 2A-like sequences in the genomes of a wide range of multicellular organisms and, as in the trypanosome genomes, within non-LTR retrotransposons (non-LTRs)-clustering in the Rex1, Crack, L2, L2A, and CR1 clades, in addition to Ingi. These 2A-like sequences were tested for translational recoding activity, and highly active sequences were found within the Rex1, L2, CR1, and Ingi clades. The presence of 2A-like sequences within non-LTRs may not only represent a method of controlling protein biogenesis but also shows some correlation with such apurinic/apyrimidinic DNA endonuclease-type non-LTRs encoding one, rather than two, open reading frames (ORFs). Interestingly, such non-LTRs cluster with closely related elements lacking 2A-like recoding elements but retaining ORF1. Taken together, these observations suggest that acquisition of 2A-like translational recoding sequences may have played a role in the evolution of these elements.

Physiological traits, such as hormonal responses, provide important mechanisms by which individuals can adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions. It is therefore expected that selection shapes hormonal traits, but the strength and the direction of selection on plastic hormonal signals are still under investigation. Here, we determined whether, and in which way, selection is acting on the hormones corticosterone and prolactin by characterizing endocrine phenotypes and their relationship with fitness in free-living great tits, Parus major. We quantified variation in circulating concentrations of baseline and stress-induced corticosterone and in prolactin during the prebreeding (Marchch) and the breeding season (May) for two consecutive years, and correlated these with reproductive success (yearly fledgling number) and overwinter survival in female and male individuals. In both years, individuals with high baseline corticosterone concentrations in Marchch had the highest yearly fledgling numbers while in May, individuals with low baseline corticosterone had the highest yearly reproductive success. Likewise, individuals that displayed strong seasonal plasticity in baseline corticosterone concentrations (high in Marchch and low in May) had the highest reproductive success in each year. Prolactin concentrations were not related to reproductive success, but were positively correlated to the proximity to lay. Between-year plasticity in stress-induced corticosterone concentrations of males was related to yearly variation in food abundance, but not to overall reproductive success. These findings suggest that seasonally alternating directional selection is operating on baseline corticosterone concentrations in both sexes. The observed between-year consistency in selection patterns indicates that a one-time hormone sample in a given season can allow the prediction of individual fitness.

However, data on age-specific expression and benefits of sexually selected traits are lacking-particularly for traits subject to sexual conflict. We addressed this by using as a model the responses of Drosophila melanogaster females of different ages to receipt of sex peptide (SP), a seminal fluid protein transferred with sperm during mating. SP can mediate sexual conflict, benefitting males while causing fitness costs in females. Virgin and mated females of all ages showed significantly reduced receptivity in response to SP. However, only young virgin females also showed increased egg laying hence, there was a narrow demographic window of maximal responses to SP. Males gained significant 'per mating' fitness benefits only when mating with young females. The pattern completely reversed in matings with older females, where SP transfer was costly. The overall benefits of SP transfer (hence opportunity for selection) therefore reversed with female age. The data reveal a new example of demographic variation in the strength of selection, with convergence and conflicts of interest between males and ageing females occurring over different facets of responses to a sexually antagonistic trait.

This algorithm and a linear stability analysis is used to investigate the evolution of recombination rates in a multi-locus, haploid-selection, symmetric-viability model for which stable equilibria have recently been determined. When the starting equilibrium is symmetric with two selected loci, we show analytically that modifier alleles that reduce recombination always invade. When the starting equilibrium is monomorphic, and there is a fixed nonzero recombination rate between the modifier locus and the selected loci, we determine analytical conditions for which a modifier allele can invade. In particular, we show that a gap exists between the recombination rates of modifiers that can invade and the recombination rate that specifies the lower stability boundary of the monomorphic equilibrium. A numerical investigation shows that a similar gap exists in a weakened form when the starting equilibrium is fully polymorphic but asymmetric. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Combined phylogenetic analysis of morphological and molecular data supports placement of Eocypselus outside the crown radiation of Apodiformes. The new specimen is the first described fossil of Pan-Apodiformes from the pre-Pleistocene of North America and the only reported stem taxon with informative feather preservation. Wing morphology of Eocypselus rowei sp. November. is intermediate between the short wings of hummingbirds and the hyper-elongated wings of extant swifts, and shows neither modifications for the continuous gliding used by swifts nor modifications for the hovering flight style used by hummingbirds. Elongate hindlimb elements, particularly the pedal phalanges, also support stronger perching capabilities than are present in Apodiformes. The new species is the smallest bird yet described from the Green River Formation, and supports the hypothesis that a Decemberrease in body size preceded flight specializations in Pan-Apodiformes. The specimen also provides the first instance of melanosome morphology preserved in association with skeletal remains from the Green River Formation.

Using the model system of the post-Pleistocene radiation of Bahamas mosquitofish (Gambusia hubbsi) inhabiting blue holes, we used a comparative field study to examine variation in density, age structure, tertiary (adult) sex ratio, habitat use, as well as adult feeding and social behaviors in relation to environmental features including predation risk, interspecific competition, productivity (e.g. chlorophyll a, zooplankton density), and abiotic factors (e.g. salinity, surface diameter). The priMarchy environmental factor associated with ecological differentiation in G. hubbsi was the presence of piscivorous fish. Gambusia hubbsi populations coexisting with predatory fish were less dense, comprised of a smaller proportion of juveniles, and were more concentrated in shallow, near-shore regions of blue holes. In addition to predation risk, the presence of a competitor fish species was associated with G. hubbsi habitat use, and productivity covaried with both age structure and habitat use. Feeding and social behaviors differed considerably between sexes, and both sexes showed behavioral differences between predator regimes by exhibiting more foraging behaviors in the absence of predators and more sexual behaviors in their presence. Males additionally exhibited more aggressive behaviors toward females in the absence of predators, but were more aggressive toward other males in the presence of predators. These results largely matched a priori predictions, and several findings are similar to trends in other related systems. Variation in predation risk appears to represent the priMarchy driver of ecological differentiation in this system, but other previously underappreciated factors (interspecific competition, resource availability) are notable contributors as well. This study highlights the utility of simultaneously evaluating multiple environmental factors and multiple population characteristics within a natural system to pinpoint environmental drivers of ecological differentiation.

Here, we explore patterns of continental-scale diversification in a groundwater species-rich clade, the superfamily Aselloidea (Pancrustacea: Isopoda). Our analyses supported a constant diversification rate during most of the course of Aselloidea evolution, until 4-15 Ma when diversification rates started to Decemberrease. This constant accumulation of lineages challenges the view that groundwater species diversification in temperate regions might have been priMarchily driven by major changes in physical environment leading to the extinction of surface populations and subsequent synchronous isolation of multiple groundwater populations. Rather than acting synchronously over broad geographic regions, factors causing extinction of surface populations and subsequent reproductive isolation of groundwater populations may act in a local and asynchronous manner, thereby resulting in a constant speciation rate over time. Our phylogeny also revealed several cases of parapatric distributions among closely related surface-water and groundwater species suggesting that species diversification could also arise from a process of disruptive selection along the surface-subterranean environmental gradient. Our results call for re-evaluating the spatial scale and timing of factors causing diversification events in groundwater.

Selfish genetic elements (SGEs), DNA sequences that can spread in a population despite being associated with a fitness cost to the individual organism, make up the largest component in many plant genomes, but their role in the genetics of speciation has long been controversial. However, the realization that many organisms have evolved a variety of suppressor mechanisms that reduce the deleterious effects of SGEs has spurred renewed interest in their importance for speciation. The relationship between SGEs and their suppressors often results in strong selection on at least two interacting loci and this arms race therefore creates a situation where SGEs may give rise to hybrid dysgenesis due to Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (BDMIs). Here, I argue that examples of SGEs underlying BDMIs may be particularly common among plants compared to other taxa and that a focus on loci involved in genetic conflicts may be especially useful for workers interested in the genetics of plant speciation. I first discuss why the frequent mating system shifts and hybridization events in plants make for a specifically dynamic relationship between SGEs and plant host genomes. I then review some recent empirical observations consistent with SGE-induced speciation in plants. Lastly, I suggest some future directions to test fully the utility of this perspective.

Environmental change associated with urbanization represents a potentially potent source of selection. While urban environments generally have lowered biodiversity, some clades seem to thrive in urban settings. For example, many members of the bird family Turdidae, known as the true thrushes' and the blackbird Turdus merula (Fig. 1) in particular, are familiar urban species. Indeed, the colonization of urban environments by blackbirds has become a textbook case study for our understanding of the many ways a wild species can deal with urbanization. In this issue, Mueller etal. (Molecular Ecology, 00, 2013, 00) add to that story by beginning to address the genetic nature of behavioural adaptation of blackbirds colonizing urban areas. They do this by testing for divergence between paired urban and rural samples at a suite of candidate genes with hypothesized effects on behaviours thought to be important for the colonization of urban environments. They find evidence for consistent patterns of divergence at an exonic microsatellite associated with the SERT gene. SERT has a number of hypothesized behavioural effects, including harm avoidance, which may be associated with tolerating the hustle and bustle of urban environments. This is among the first evidence that behavioural differences between urban and rural environments have a genetic basis and this work suggests that urban environments can in some cases exert homogeneous selection pressures.

We describe a method for calculating fibular facet orientation on digital models of astragali as the angle between the planes of the fibular facet and the lateral tibial facet. We calculated this value in a sample that includes all major extant primate clades, a diversity of Paleogene primates, and nonprimate euarchontans (n=304). Results show that previous characterization of a divide between extant haplorhines and strepsirrhines is accurate, with little overlap even when individual data points are considered. Fibular facet orientation is conserved in extant strepsirrhines despite major differences in locomotion and body size, while extant anthropoids are more variable (e.g., low values for catarrhines relative to non-callitrichine platyrrhines). Euprimate outgroups exhibit a mosaic of character states with Cynocephalus having a more obtuse strepsirrhine-like facet and sampled treeshrews and plesiadapiforms having more acute haplorhine-like facets. Surprisingly, the earliest species of the adapiform Cantius have steep haplorhine-like facets as well. We used a Bayesian approach to reconstruct the evolution of fibular facet orientation as a continuous character across a supertree of living and extinct primates. Mean estimates for crown Primatomorpha (97.9 degrees), Primates (99.5 degrees), Haplorhini (98.7 degrees), and Strepsirrhini (108.2 degrees) support the hypothesis that the strepsirrhine condition is derived, while lower values for crown Anthropoidea (92.8 degrees) and Catarrhini (88.9 degrees) are derived in the opposite direction.

In North American hot springs, diversification of a clade of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus into hotter environments has resulted in the unique inNovemberation of a light-driven ecosystem at temperatures up to 74 degrees C, and temperature adaptation of photosynthetic carbon fixation with the Calvin cycle contributed to this process. Here, we investigated the evolution of thermostability of the Calvin cycle enzyme ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) during Synechococcus divergence. Circular dichroism thermal scans revealed that the RuBisCO of the most thermotolerant Synechococcus lineage is more stable than those of other lineages or of resurrected ancestral enzymes. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we next identified four amino acid substitutions that together increased stability and activity of this enzyme at higher temperatures. These are clustered near critical subunit interfaces distant from the active site. Each of the four amino acids is also observed in a less thermostable Synechococcus RuBisCO, and the impact on stability of three of these appears to be epistatic. Recombination analyses that allow for recurrent mutation as well as patterns of synonymous variation surrounding these sites suggest that the evolution of a more thermostable RuBisCO may have involved homologous recombination. Our results provide insights on the molecular evolutionary processes that shape niche differentiation and ecosystem function.

Host and pathogen ecology is a potentially important source of that variation. Theory of its effects has been developed through the study of non-spatial models, but host population spatial structure has been shown to influence evolutionary outcomes. To date, the effects of basic host and pathogen demography on pathogen evolution have not been thoroughly explored in a spatial context. Here we use simulations to show that space produces Novemberel predictions of the influence of the shape of the pathogen's transmission-virulence tradeoff, as well as host reproduction and mortality, on the pathogen's evolutionary stable transmission rate. Importantly, non-spatial models predict that neither the slope of linear transmission-virulence relationships, nor the host reproduction rate will influence pathogen evolution, and that host mortality will only influence it when there is a transmission-virulence tradeoff. We show that this is not the case in a spatial context, and identify the ecological conditions under which spatial effects are most influential. Thus, these results may help explain observed natural variation among pathogens unexplainable by non-spatial models, and provide guidance about when space should be considered. We additionally evaluate the ability of existing analytical approaches to predict the influence of ecology, namely spatial moment equations closed with an improved pair approximation (IPA). The IPA is known to have limited accuracy, but here we show that in the context of pathogens the limitations are substantial: in many cases, IPA incorrectly predicts evolution to pathogen-driven extinction. Despite these limitations, we suggest that the impact of ecology can still be understood within the conceptual framework arising from spatial moment equations, that of self-shading'', whereby the spread of highly transmissible pathogens is impeded by local depletion of susceptible hosts.

Divergence hitchhiking (DH) theory postulates that divergent selection on a locus reduces gene flow at physically linked sites, facilitating the formation of localized clusters of tightly linked, diverged loci. Genome hitchhiking (GH) theory emphasizes genome-wide effects of divergent selection. Past theoretical investigations of DH and GH focused on static snapshots of divergence. Here, we used simulations assessing a variety of strengths of selection, migration rates, population sizes, and mutation rates to investigate the relative importance of direct selection, GH, and DH in facilitating the dynamic buildup of genomic divergence as speciation proceeds through time. When divergently selected mutations were limiting, GH promoted divergence, but DH had little measurable effect. When populations were small and divergently selected mutations were common, DH enhanced the accumulation of weakly selected mutations, but this contributed little to reproductive isolation. In general, GH promoted reproductive isolation by reducing effective migration rates below that due to direct selection alone, and was important for genome-wide congealing or coupling of differentiation (F-ST) across loci as speciation progressed.

The PAR is a way for organisms to maximize fitness in varying environments. Insects living in seasonal environments are valuable model systems for testing the existence and form of PAR. Previous manipulations of the larval and the adult environments of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana have shown that individuals that were food restricted during the larval stage coped better with forced flight during the adult stage compared to those with optimal conditions in the larval stage. Here, we describe a state-dependent energy allocation model, which we use to test whether such a response to food restriction could be adaptive in nature where this butterfly exhibits seasonal cycles. The results from the model confirm the responses obtained in our previous experimental work and show how such an outcome was facilitated by resource allocation patterns to the thorax during the pupal stage. We conclude that for B. anynana, early-stage cues can direct development toward a better adapted phenotype later in life and, therefore, that a PAR has evolved in this species.

Dr. Morris Goodman founded the journal Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution as a forum where scientists could further our knowledge about the tree of life, and he recognized that the inference of species trees is a first and fundamental step to addressing many important evolutionary questions. In particular, Dr. Goodman was interested in obtaining a complete picture of the primate species tree in order to provide an evolutionary context for the study of human adaptations. A number of recent studies use multi-locus datasets to infer well-resolved and well-supported primate phylogenetic trees using consensus approaches (e.g., supermatrices). It is therefore tempting to assume that we have a complete picture of the primate tree, especially above the species level. However, recent theoretical and empirical work in the field of molecular phylogenetics demonstrates that consensus methods might provide a false sense of support at certain nodes. In this brief review we discuss the current state of primate molecular phylogenetics and highlight the importance of exploring the use of coalescent-based analyses that have the potential to better utilize information contained in multi-locus data.

Abundant sequence data should allow more-complex models to be fit at higher confidence, making phylogenetic inference more reliable and improving our understanding of evolution at the molecular level. However, concern that approaches based on multiple sequence alignment may be computationally infeasible for large datasets is driving the development of so-called alignment-free methods for sequence comparison and phylogenetic inference. The recent editorial characterized these approaches as model-free, not based on the concept of homology, and lacking in biological intuition. We argue here that alignment-free methods have not abandoned models or homology, and can be biologically intuitive.

However, the study in question failed to account for factors known to affect egg and clutch size in living bird species. A new scaling analysis of avian clutch mass demonstrates that type of parental care cannot be distinguished by conventional allometry because of the confounding effects of phylogeny and hatchling maturity. Precociality of young but not paternal care in the theropod ancestors of birds is consistent with the available data.

A genomic element Marchked by the gene Gp-9 determines whether workers tolerate one or many fertile queens in their colony. Gp-9 was recently shown to be part of a supergene with two nonrecombining variants, SB and Sb. SB/SB and SB/Sb queens differ in how they initiate new colonies, and in many physiological traits, for example odour and maturation rate. To understand how a single genetic element can affect all these traits, we used a microarray to compare gene expression patterns between SB/SB and SB/Sb queens of three different age classes: 1-day-old unmated queens, 11-day-old unmated queens and mated, fully reproductive queens collected from mature field colonies. The number of genes that were differentially expressed between SB/SB and SB/Sb queens of the same age class was smallest in 1-day-old queens, maximal in 11-day-old queens and intermediate in reproductive queens. Gene ontology analysis showed that SB/SB queens upregulate reproductive genes faster than SB/Sb queens. For all age classes, genes inside the supergene were overrepresented among the differentially expressed genes. Consistent with the hypothesized greater number of transposons in the Sb supergene, 13 transposon genes were upregulated in SB/Sb queens. Viral genes were also upregulated in SB/Sb mature queens, consistent with the known greater parasite load in colonies headed by SB/Sb queens compared with colonies headed by SB/SB queens. Eighteen differentially expressed genes between reproductive queens were involved in chemical signalling. Our results suggest that many genes in the supergene are involved in regulating social organization and queen phenotypes in fire ants.

We analysed sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA (ETS, ITS) and three plasmid loci (ndhF, psbA-trnH, and trnL-F) using the multi-species coalescent module in BEAST. A total of 129 individuals from all 10 recognised species of Centipeda were sampled throughout the species distribution ranges, including two subspecies. We conclude that the inferred species tree topology largely conform previous assumptions on species relationships. Centipeda racemosa (Snuffweed) is the sister to remaining species, which is also the only consistently perennial representative in the genus. Centipeda pleiocephala (Tall Sneezeweed) and C. nidiformis (Cotton Sneezeweed) constitute a species pair, as does C borealis and C. minima (Spreading Sneezeweed), all sharing the symplesiomorphic characters of spherical capitulum and convex receptacle with C. racemosa. Another species group comprising C. thespidioides (Desert Sneezeweed), C cunninghamii (Old man weed, or Common sneeze-weed), C crateriformis is well-supported but then include the morphologically aberrant C. aotearoana, all sharing the character of having capitula that mature more slowly relative the subtending shoot. Centipeda elatinoides takes on a weakly supported intermediate position between the two mentioned groups, and is difficult to relate to any of the former groups based on morphological characters.

We assess morphological affinities of the new specimen using three-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses with a comparative sample of primate calcanei representing major extinct and extant radiations (n=58 genera, 106 specimens). Our analyses reveal that the calcaneal morphology of Proteopithecus is most similar to that of the younger Fayum parapithecid Apidium. Principal components analysis places Apidium and Proteopithecus in an intermediate position between primitive euprimates and crown anthropoids, based priMarchily on landMarchk configurations corresponding to moderate distal elongation, a more distal position of the peroneal tubercle, and a relatively unflexed calcaneal body. Proteopithecus and Apidium are similar to cercopithecoids and some omomyiforms in having an ectal facet that is more tightly curved, along with a larger degree of proximal calcaneal elongation, whereas other Fayum anthropoids, platyrrhines and adapiforms have a more open facet with less proximal elongation. The similarity to cercopithecoids is most plausibly interpreted as convergence given the less tightly curved ectal facets of stem catarrhines. The priMarchy similarities between Proteopithecus and platyrrhines are mainly in the moderate distal elongation and the more distal position of the peroneal tubercle, both of which are not unique to these groups. Proteopithecus and Apidium exhibit derived anthropoid features, but also a suite of primitive retentions. The calcaneal morphology of Proteopithecus is consistent with our cladistic analysis, which places proteopithecids as a sister group of Parapithecoidea.

Indeed, an important challenge in theoretical population genetics is to incorporate effects of demographic history and population structure. But important design problems (e.g. focus on populations as units, focus on hard selective sweeps, no hypothesis-based framework in the design of the statistical tests) reduce their capability of detecting adaptive genetic variation. In parallel, landscape genomics offers a solution to several of these problems and provides a number of advantages (e.g. fast computation, landscape heterogeneity integration). But the approach makes several implicit assumptions that should be carefully considered (e.g. selection has had enough time to create a functional relationship between the allele distribution and the environmental variable, or this functional relationship is assumed to be constant). To address the respective strengths and weaknesses mentioned above, the workshop brought together a panel of experts from both disciplines to present their work and discuss the relevance of combining these approaches, possibly resulting in a joint software solution in the future.

This annotation information, which has accumulated over two Decemberades, has been obtained with a diverse set of computational tools and annotation strategies. Despite all efforts of manual curation it is still plagued by misassignments of reading directions, erroneous gene names, and missing as well as false positive annotations in particular for the RNA genes. Taken together, this causes substantial problems for fully automatic pipelines that aim to use these data comprehensively for studies of animal phylogenetics and the molecular evolution of mitogenomes. The MITOS pipeline is designed to compute a consistent de Novembero annotation of the mitogenomic sequences. We show that the results of MITOS match RefSeq and MitoZoa in terms of annotation coverage and quality. At the same time we avoid biases, inconsistencies of nomenclature, and typos originating from manual curation strategies.

Metazoan phylogeny was recently challenged by large scale EST approaches (phylogenomics), stabilizing classical nodes while simultaneously supporting new sister group hypotheses. The use of mitochondrial data in deep phylogeny analyses was often criticized because of high substitution rates on nucleotides, large differences in amino acid substitution rate between taxa, and biases in nucleotide frequencies. Nevertheless, mitochondrial genome data might still be promising as it allows for a larger taxon sampling, while presenting a smaller amount of sequence information. We present the most comprehensive analysis of bilaterian relationships based on mitochondrial genome data. The analyzed data set comprises more than 650 mitochondrial genomes that have been chosen to represent a profound sample of the phylogenetic as well as sequence diversity. The results are based on high quality amino acid alignments obtained from a complete reannotation of the mitogenomic sequences from NCBI RefSeq database. However, the results failed to give support for many otherwise undisputed high-ranking taxa, like Mollusca, Hexapoda, Arthropoda, and suffer from extreme long branches of Nematoda, Platyhelminthes, and some other taxa. In order to identify the sources of misleading phylogenetic signals, we discuss several problems associated with mitochondrial genome data sets, e.g. the nucleotide and amino acid landscapes and a strong correlation of gene rearrangements with long branches.

These worms use vertebrates (Marchine mammals, fish-eating birds and waterfowl) as definitive hosts and invertebrates (amphipods, Decemberapods and euphausiids) as intermediate hosts to complete their life cycle. Polymorphidae has a wordwide distribution, containing 12 genera, with approximately 127 species. The family is diagnosed by having a spinose trunk, bulbose proboscis, double-walled proboscis receptacle, and usually four to eight tubular cement glands. To conduct a phylogenetic analysis, in the current study sequences of the small (18S) and large-subunit (28S) ribosomal RNA, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox I) were generated for 27 taxa representing 10 of 12 genera of Polymorphidae, plus three additional species of acanthocephalans that were used as outgroups. Maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP), and Bayesian analyses were conducted on a combined nuclear rRNA (18S + 28S) data set and on a concatenated dataset of nuclear plus one mitochondrial gene (18S + 28S + cox 1). Phylogenetic analyses inferred with the concatenated dataset of three genes support the monophyly of nine genera (Andracantha, Corynosoma, Bolbosoma, Profilicollis, Pseudocorynosoma, Southwellina, Arhythmorhynchus, Hexaglandula and Ibirhynchus). However, the four sampled species of Polymorphus were nested within several clades, indicating that these species do not share a common ancestor, requiring further taxonomic revision using phylogenetic systematics, and reexamination of morphological and ecological data. By mapping definitive and intermediate host association onto the resulting cladogram, we observe that aquatic birds were the ancestral definitive hosts for the family with a secondary colonization and diversification to Marchine mammals. Whereas amphipods were ancestral intermediate hosts and that the association with Decemberapods represent episodes of secondary colonization that arose several times during the evolutionary history of the family. Our results are useful to start testing hypothesis about the evolutionary history of this highly diverse family of acanthocephalans. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the vast majority of symbionts colonize their hosts' mucosal compartments without triggering any immune response, resulting in durable commensal associations. Here, I propose a simple extension of previous mathematical models for antagonistic coevolution in which the host can mount a delayed immune response in response, the symbiont can change its virulence following this activation. Even though the levels of virulence in both phases are assumed to be genetically determined, this simple form of plasticity can select for commensal associations. In particular, coevolution can result in hosts that do not activate their immune response, thus preventing phenotypically plastic pathogens from switching to a higher virulence level. I argue that, from the host's point of view, this state is analogous to the mafia behaviour previously described in avian brood parasites. More importantly, this study provides a new hypothesis for the maintenance of a commensal relationship through antagonistic coevolution.

In contrast, segregating load due to mutations of low frequency should Decemberline in smaller populations, at least when mutations are highly recessive and strongly deleterious. Strong local selection generally reduces both types of load. We tested these predictions in 13 isolated, outcrossing populations of Arabidopsis lyrata that varied in population size and plant density. Long-term size was estimated by expected heterozygosity at 20 microsatellite loci. Segregating load was assessed by comparing performance of offspring from selfings versus within-population crosses. Drift load was the heterosis effect created by interpopulation outbreeding. Results showed that segregating load was unrelated to long-term size. However, drift load was significantly higher in populations of small effective size and low density. Drift load was mostly expressed late in development, but started as early as germination and accumulated thereafter. The study largely confirms predictions of theory and illustrates that mutation accumulation can be a threat to natural populations.

It has been proposed, therefore, that divergence in acoustic signals plays a key role in speciation. Nonetheless, the processes driving divergence of acoustic traits and their consequences in terms of speciation are poorly understood. A review of empirical and comparative studies reveals strong support for a role of sexual selection in acoustic divergence, but the possible concomitant influences of ecological context are rarely examined. We sumMarchize a conceptual framework for testing the relative significance of both adaptive and neutral mechanisms leading to acoustic divergence, predictions for cases where these processes lead to speciation, and how their relative importance plays out over evolutionary time.

However, there is little information available on DNA content evolution in liverworts, the likely sister group to all other living plants. This study seeks to detect a phylogenetic structure in the variation in genome size and degree of endopolyploidy within liverworts. Furthermore, we test the hypothesis that shifts in breeding systems and genome size are correlated, as polyploidy is suggested to be a possible mechanism for the evolution of monoecy in liverworts and could therefore be associated with larger genome sizes. Genome size was determined for 67 liverwort species from 33 families using flow cytometry. Estimates for 48 species and 16 families are new to science. A phylogeny was reconstructed using the plastid gene rbcL. Over all taxa analyzed, there was a considerable range in genome size estimates with 1C-values from 0.27 pg (Junegermannia rubra) to 20.46 pg (Phyllothallia fuegiana). Large genome sizes were also found in the Haplomitriopsida. None of the liverwort species showed evidence of endopolyploidy. Although some taxa may be polyploids, a correlation between shifts in genome size and breeding system is lacking. Importantly, genome size variation in liverworts exhibits strong phylogenetic signal (Pagel's lambda = 0.99955). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Descendants of the ancestral stock in the Miocene Aegean Plate presently occur in the Anatolia, Aegean islands and the Balkan Penninsula. Troglophilus (Orthoptera, Rhaphidophoridae, Troglophilinae) is such a genus represented in these areas with approximately 15 species. The present study addresses the phylogeography of the genus, with a special emphasis on its Anatolian members, aiming to test the biogeographical patterns suggested for this area using mitochondrial [cytochome oxidase I (COI)] and nuclear (ITS1-5.8SITS2) Marchkers. Data matrices obtained from sequences of COI and ITS1-5.8SITS2 were used for phylogenetic analyses using Dolichopoda lycia and Dolichopoda sbordonii as outgroups. All sets of the analyses suggested monophyly of the Anatolian haplotypes, although they are not congruent in revealing their relationships. Anatolian haplotypes constituted three main phylogroups in trees calculated from a matrix of short COI sequences: the ECMA (corresponding to the Eastern part of coastal Mediterranean Anatolia) the CWMA (from the Central and Western part of Mediterranean Anatolia) and NA (from Northern Anatolia). Trees obtained using longer sequences resulted in only two phylogroups, namely ECMA and CWMA?+?NA. The trees based on the ITS1-5.8SITS2 data matrix supported monophyly of Anatolian phylogroups. BEAST analysis of the COI estimated the time to most recent common ancestor for Dolichopoda and Troglophilus as 10.8 Mya, to that for the Anatolian?+?Balkan Troglophilus as 7.2 Mya, and to that for the Anatolian Troglophilus as 6.3 Mya. BEAST analysis of ITS1ITS2 intron regions is largely congruent with that of COI. From these results, several conclusions were drawn. First, the divergence of Dolichopoda and Troglophilus possibly started with the opening of the Mid-Aegean Trench in the Tortonian. Second, Troglophilus possibly originated from an ancestral stock in the old Aegean Plate. It later diverged as Anatolian and Balkan lineages and, possibly, the Cretan population may be regarded the third lineage. Divergence within the Anatolian lineage is estimated to have occurred through the Pliocene and Pleistocene, although before the last four glacial periods in the late Pleistocene. Additionally, the northern Anatolian Troglophilus appears to originate from the dispersal of an ancestral stock from a mountainous lineage through the Taurus Way.

The house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) introduced on the Sub-Antarctic Guillou Island (Kerguelen Archipelago) had and still has to face environmental conditions that likely shaped the pattern and pace of its insular evolution. Since mouse arrival on the island, probably not more than two centuries ago, ecological conditions dramatically differed from those available to their Western European commensal source populations. In addition, over the last two Decemberades, the plant and animal communities of Guillou Island were considerably modified by the eradication of rabbits, the effects of climate change and the spread of invasive species detrimental to native communities. Under such a changing habitat, the mouse response was investigated using a morphometric quantification of mandible and molar tooth, two morphological structures related to food processing. A Marchked differentiation of the insular mice compared with their relatives from Western Europe was documented for both mandibles and molar shapes. Moreover, these shapes changed through the 16years of the record, in agreement with expectations of drift for the molar, but more than expected by chance for the mandible. These results suggest that mice responded to the recent changes in food resources, possibly with a part of plastic variation for the mandible prone to bone remodelling. This pattern exemplifies the intricate interplay of evolution, ecology and plasticity that is a probable key of the success of such an invasive rodent facing pronounced shifts in food resources exploitation under a changing environment.

Whether selection also produces convergent genomic changes in these situations remains largely unknown. The variable groundsel, Senecio lautus, is an excellent system to investigate the genetic underpinnings of convergent evolution, because morphologically similar forms of these plants have adapted to the same environments along the coast of Australia. We compared range-wide patterns of genomic divergence in natural populations of this plant and searched for regions putatively affected by natural selection. Our results indicate that environmental adaptation followed complex genetic trajectories, affecting multiple loci, implying both the parallel recruitment of the same alleles and the divergence of completely different genomic regions across geography. An analysis of the biological functions of candidate genes suggests that adaptation to coastal environments may have occurred through the recruitment of different genes participating in similar processes. The relatively low genetic convergence that characterizes the parallel evolution of S. lautus forms suggests that evolution is more constrained at higher levels of biological organization.

Tolerance to one stress may be complicated by exposure to other stressors experienced by the preceding generations. We studied whether parental temperature stress affects tolerance to insecticide in the invasive Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa Decemberemlineata. Field-collected pyrethroid-resistant beetles were reared under either stressful (17 degrees C) or favourable (23 degrees C) insecticide-free environments for three generations. Then, larvae were exposed to pyrethroid insecticides in common garden conditions (23 degrees C). Beetles were in general tolerant to stress. The parental temperature stress alone affected beetles positively (increased adult weight) but it impaired their tolerance to insecticide exposure. In contrast, offspring from the favourable temperature regime showed compensatory weight gain in response to insecticide exposure. Our study emphasizes the potential of cross-generational effects modifying species stress tolerance. When resistant pest populations invade benign environments, a re-application of insecticides may enhance their performance via hormetic effects. In turn, opposite effects may arise if parental generations have been exposed to temperature stress. Thus, the outcome of management practices of invasive pest species is difficult to predict unless we also incorporate knowledge of the evolutionary and recent (preceding generations) stress history of the given populations into pest management.

Another potential source of adaptive variation is adaptive variants from other (donor) species that are introgressed into the (recipient) species, termed adaptive introgression. Here, the various attributes of these three potential sources of adaptive variation are compared. For example, the rate of adaptive change is generally thought to be faster from standing variation, slower from mutation and potentially intermediate from adaptive introgression. Additionally, the higher initial frequency of adaptive variation from standing variation and lower initial frequency from mutation might result in a higher probability of fixation of the adaptive variants for standing variation. Adaptive variation from introgression might have higher initial frequency than new adaptive mutations but lower than that from standing variation, again making the impact of adaptive introgression variation potentially intermediate. Adaptive introgressive variants might have multiple changes within a gene and affect multiple loci, an advantage also potentially found for adaptive standing variation but not for new adaptive mutants. The processes that might produce a common variant in two taxa, convergence, trans-species polymorphism from incomplete lineage sorting or from balancing selection and adaptive introgression, are also compared. Finally, potential examples of adaptive introgression in animals, including balancing selection for multiple alleles for major histocompatibility complex (MHC), S and csd genes, pesticide resistance in mice, black colour in wolves and white colour in coyotes, Neanderthal or Denisovan ancestry in humans, mimicry genes in Heliconius butterflies, beak traits in Darwin's finches, yellow skin in chickens and non-native ancestry in an endangered native salamander, are examined.

In this study, we characterize a 15 kb region on chromosome 3R that has introgressed from the cosmopolitan generalist species Drosophila simulans into the island endemic D. sechellia, which is an ecological specialist. The introgressed haplotype is fixed in D. sechellia over almost the entirety of the resequenced region, whereas a core region of the introgressed haplotype occurs at high frequency in D. simulans. The observed patterns of nucleotide variation and linkage disequilibrium are consistent with a recently completed selective sweep in D. sechellia and an incomplete sweep in D. simulans. Independent estimates of both the time to the introgression and sweep events are all close to 10,000 years before the present. Interestingly, the most likely target of selection is a highly occupied transcription factor binding region. This work confirms that it is possible for mutations to be globally advantageous, despite their occurrence in divergent genomic and ecological backgrounds.

However, few empirical studies have explored the molecular basis of plastic traits. The East African cichlid fish Astatoreochromis alluaudi displays adaptive phenotypic plasticity in its pharyngeal jaw apparatus, a structure that is widely seen as an evolutionary key inNovemberation that has contributed to the reMarchkable diversity of cichlid fishes. It has previously been shown that in response to different diets, the pharyngeal jaws change their size, shape and dentition: hard diets induce an adaptive robust molariform tooth phenotype with short jaws and strong internal bone structures, while soft diets induce a gracile papilliform tooth phenotype with elongated jaws and slender internal bone structures. To gain insight into the molecular underpinnings of these adaptations and enable future investigations of the role that phenotypic plasticity plays during the formation of adaptive radiations, the transcriptomes of the two divergent jaw phenotypes were examined. Our study identified a total of 187 genes whose expression differs in response to hard and soft diets, including immediate early genes, extracellular matrix genes and inflammatory factors. Transcriptome results are interpreted in light of expression of candidate genesMarchkers for tooth size and shape, bone cells and mechanically sensitive pathways. This study opens up new avenues of research at new levels of biological organization into the roles of phenotypic plasticity during speciation and radiation of cichlid fishes.

AMERICAN NATURALIST	adaptation leaf fenestration leaf shape Monstera sunfleck	LEAF-SIZE NATURAL-SELECTION GROWTH FORM FOREST LEAVES ENVIRONMENTS ARCHITECTURE EVOLUTION ARACEAE CANOPY	Adult leaf fenestration in Swiss cheese plants (Monstera Adans.) is an unusual leaf shape trait lacking a convincing evolutionary explanation. Monstera are secondary hemiepiphytes that inhabit the understory of tropical rainforests, where photosynthesis from sunflecks often makes up a large proportion of daily carbon assimilation. Here I present a simple model of leaf-level photosynthesis and whole-plant canopy dynamics in a stochastic light environment. The model demonstrates that leaf fenestration can reduce the variance in plant growth and thereby increase geometric mean fitness. This growth-variance hypothesis also suggests explanations for conspicuous ontogenetic changes in leaf morphology (heteroblasty) in Monstera, as well as the absence of leaf fenestration in co-occurring juvenile tree species. The model provides a testable hypothesis of the adaptive significance of a unique leaf shape and illustrates how variance in growth rate could be an important factor shaping plant morphology and physiology.

AFLP analyses of 130 individuals from two mixed and two pure strands of the parental species resulted in a matrix of 337 polymorphic loci that was analysed with Bayesian cluster algorithms implemented in the software programmes Structure and NewHybrids. The results, together with sequence polymorphisms of the nrDNA ITS1 + 5.8S region, indicate that the three taxa are distinctly Septemberarated and that only a few F2-hybrids and no backcrosses to the parental species are present in the surveyed mixed stands. These findings were corroborated by HPLC studies of the phenolic compounds from bark samples that were carried out for the same individuals. A multivariate statistical analysis of relative peak areas of chromatograms (PCA, principal component analysis) indicates the clear Septemberaration of parental and the intermediate position of S. x rubens individuals.

We present a comprehensive molecular phylogeny of representative haplotilapiine cichlids, combining in one data set four mitochondrial and five nuclear loci for 76 species, and compare it with phylogenetic information of a second data set of 378 mitochondrial ND2 haplotypes representing almost all important Tilapia or Tilapia-related lineages as well as most EAR lineages. The monophyly of haplotilapiines is supported, as is the nested sister group relationship of Etia and mouthbrooding tilapiines with the remaining haplotilapiines. The latter are consistently placed in eight monophyletic clades over all datasets and analyses, but several dichotomous phylogenetic relationships appear compromised by cytonuclear discordant phylogenetic signal. Based on these results as well as on extensive morphological evidence we propose a Novemberel generic and suprageneric classification including a (re-)diagnosis of 20 haplotilapiine cichlid genera and nine tribes. New tribes are provided for the former subgenera Coptodon Gervais, 1853, Heterotilapia Regan, 1920 and Pelmatolapia Thys van den Audenaerde, 1969, in addition for Tilapia joka,Tilapia sensu stricto and Chilochromis, Etia, Steatocranus sensu stricto, the mouthbrooding tilapiines and for a clade of West African tilapiines.

As females do not migrate between elephant herds, mtDNA exhibits low geographic dispersal. We therefore examined the effectiveness of mtDNA for assigning the provenance of African elephants (or their ivory). For 653 savanna and forest elephants from 22 localities in 13 countries, 4258bp of mtDNA was sequenced. We detected eight mtDNA subclades, of which seven had regionally restricted distributions. Among 108 unique haplotypes identified, 72% were found at only one locality and 84% were country specific, while 44% of individuals carried a haplotype detected only at their sampling locality. We combined 316bp of our control region sequences with those generated by previous trans-national surveys of African elephants. Among 101 unique control region haplotypes detected in African elephants across 81 locations in 22 countries, 62% were present in only a single country. Applying our mtDNA results to a previous microsatellite-based assignment study would improve estimates of the provenance of elephants in 115 of 122 mis-assigned cases. Nuclear partitioning followed species boundaries and not mtDNA subclade boundaries. For taxa such as elephants in which nuclear and mtDNA Marchkers differ in phylogeography, combining the two Marchkers can triangulate the origins of confiscated wildlife products.

Organisms: Sympatric ecotypes of anadromous and resident freshwater threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Time and place: Mud Lake, Cook Inlet region, Alaska, May-Julyy 2003. Results: Both resident and anadromous fish in Mud Lake bred priMarchily at age 2. Anadromous breeders were larger than resident breeders. Size of reproductive females Decemberlined from early to late in the breeding season for both anadromous and resident freshwater populations, but time and breeding habitat were not significant sources of variation in most life-history traits. Clutch mass showed a similar, positive correlation with female body mass in both populations, but clutch size (fecundity) rose more slowly with female size in resident fish. Both ecotypes made eggs of similar size overall, with egg size in resident females increasing modestly with female body size. Both ecotypes showed a trade-off between clutch size and egg mass after adjustment for the level of reproductive effort. The egg mass and clutch mass of both ecotypes were small compared with other Cook Inlet resident and anadromous populations.

In this study, we explored gene expression patterns in interspecific hybrid F-1, and synthetic and natural allopolyploid cotton using RNA-Seq reads from leaf transcriptomes. We determined how the extent and direction of expression level dominance (total level of expression for both homoeologs) and homoeolog expression bias (relative contribution of homoeologs to the transcriptome) changed from hybridization through evolution at the polyploid level and following cotton domestication. Genome-wide expression level dominance was biased toward the A-genome in the diploid hybrid and natural allopolyploids, whereas the direction was reversed in the synthetic allopolyploid. This biased expression level dominance was mainly caused by up-or downregulation of the homoeolog from the 'non-dominant' parent. Extensive alterations in homoeolog expression bias and expression level dominance accompany the initial merger of two diverged diploid genomes, suggesting a combination of regulatory (cis or trans) and epigenetic interactions that may arise and propagate through the transcriptome network. The extent of homoeolog expression bias and expression level dominance increases over time, from genome merger through evolution at the polyploid level. Higher rates of transgressive and Novemberel gene expression patterns as well as homoeolog silencing were observed in natural allopolyploids than in F1 hybrid and synthetic allopolyploid cottons. These observations suggest that natural selection reconciles the regulatory mismatches caused by initial genomic merger, while new gene expression conditions are generated for evaluation by selection.

The best known applications of allorecognition are the prevention of inbreeding in hermaphroditic species (e.g., the self-incompatibility [SI] systems in plants), the vertebrate immune response to foreign antigens mediated by MHC loci, and somatic fusion, where two genetically independent individuals physically join to become a chimera. In the few model systems where the loci governing allorecognition outcomes have been identified, the corresponding proteins have exhibited exceptional polymorphism. But information about the evolution of this polymorphism outside MHC is limited. We address this subject in the ascidian Botryllus schlosseri, where allorecognition outcomes are determined by a single locus, called FuHC (Fusion/HistoCompatibility). Molecular variation in FuHC is distributed almost entirely within populations, with very little evidence for differentiation among different populations. Mutation plays a larger role than recombination in the creation of FuHC polymorphism. A selection statistic, neutrality tests, and distribution of variation within and among different populations all provide evidence for selection acting on FuHC, but are not in agreement as to whether the selection is balancing or directional.

Amygdalus (Rosaceae) based on DNA sequences and morphology	PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION	Almonds Amygdalus Asia Molecular phylogeny Prunus	CHLOROPLAST DNA NONCODING REGIONS INFERENCE TORTOISE UTILITY ORIGIN	Almonds and peaches are among the most economically important fruit crops in subtropical and temperate regions. Questions regarding the origin and domestication of the crop species, interspecific relationships, and evolutionary patterns of fruits have remained unanswered due to the lack of phylogenetic data of Prunus subgenus Amygdalus, in which both almond and peach are classified. Twenty-two species of subg. Amygdalus were included in phylogenetic analyses of plastid ndhF-rpl32, rpL16, trnH-psbA, trnL-trnF, trnQ-5'rps16, and trnS-trnG and nuclear s6pdh genes to investigate the circumscription of subg. Amygdalus, phylogenetic relationships among the species, and implication for mesocarp and endocarp evolution. Prunus subg. Amygdalus is best circumscribed to include both almonds and peaches, comprising two sections, Amygdalus and Persica. Species traditionally placed close to almonds, such as P. tenella, P. petunnikowii, P. triloba, and P. pedunculata, should be excluded from subg. Amygdalus. Characteristics used to diagnose subg. Amygdalus, such as dry, splitting mesocarp and the ornamentation of endocarp evolved multiple times in Prunus thus classification based solely on these morphological characters produces a taxonomic scheme that might not represent common ancestry. A dry, splitting mesocarp is likely to be ancestral for the common ancestor of subg. Amygdalus, and the fleshy, non-splitting mesocarp found in peaches was derived from the dry, splitting mesocarp, presumably by domestication and selection for a fleshy fruit in China. Very low genetic divergence among cultivated almond and its close relatives might be associated with gene flow and/or rapid speciation within the group.

This is surprising given the importance of bees for crop pollination and the effect of humans in transforming ecosystems via agriculture. In the Pacific, where the bee fauna appears depauperate, their importance as pollinators is not clear, particularly in Fiji where species diversity is even lower than neighbouring archipelagos. Here we explore the radiation of halictine bees in Fiji using phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA COI sequence data. Our analyses indicate the existence of several 'deep' clades whose divergences are close to the crown node, along with a highly derived 'broom' clade showing very high haplotype diversity, and mostly limited to low-lying agricultural regions. This derived clade is very abundant, whereas the more basal clades were relatively rare. Although nearly all haplotype diversity in Fijian Hornalictus comprises synonymous substitutions, a small number of amino acid changes are associated with the major clades, including the hyper-diverse clade. Analyses of haplotype lineage accumulation show a steep increase in selectively neutral COI haplotypes corresponding to the emergence of this 'broom' clade. We explore three possible scenarios for this dramatic increase: (i) a key change in adaptedness to the environment, (ii) a large-scale extinction event, or (iii) a dramatic increase in suitable habitats leading to rapid population expansion. Using estimated mutation rates of mitochondrial DNA in other invertebrates, we argue that Homalictus first colonised the Fijian archipelago in the middle-late Pleistocene, and the rapid accumulation of haplotypes in the hyper-diverse clade occurred in the Holocene, but prior to recorded human presence in the Fijian region. Our results indicate that bees have not been important pollinators of Fijian ecosystems until very recent times. Post-Pleistocene climate change and anthropogenic effects on Fijian ecosystems are likely to have greatly transformed pollinator suites from the conditions when those ecosystems were first being assembled.

Here we develop and analyze mathematical models of mutualistic communities, such as those between plants and pollinators or plants and seed-dispersers to evaluate the importance of coevolutionary selection within complex communities. Our analyses reveal that coevolutionary selection can drive significant changes in trait distributions with important consequences for the network structure of mutualistic communities. One such consequence is greater connectance caused by an almost invariable increase in the rate of mutualistic interaction within the community. Another important consequence is altered patterns of nestedness. Specifically, interactions mediated by a mechanism of phenotype matching tend to be antinested when coevolutionary selection is weak and even more strongly antinested as increasing coevolutionary selection favors the emergence of reciprocal specialization. In contrast, interactions mediated by a mechanism of phenotype differences tend to be nested when coevolutionary selection is weak, but less nested as increasing coevolutionary selection favors greater levels of generalization in both plants and animals. Taken together, our results show that coevolutionary selection can be an important force within mutualistic communities, driving changes in trait distributions, interaction rates, and even network structure.

A Study in the Ocellated Wrasse (Symphodus ocellatus)	AMERICAN NATURALIST	cooperation competition sneak-fertilization aggression sperm competition alternative male tactics	MEDITERRANEAN WRASSE ETHEOSTOMA-OLMSTEDI MATING SUCCESS FEMALE CHOICE PATERNAL CARE EVOLUTION MALES FISH BEHAVIOR CONFLICT	Although cooperating individuals may gain benefits, they risk being cheated by their allies. Therefore, to understand the persistence of cooperation by mutual benefits, it is important to document both the potential benefits of cooperation and the risks of cheating. We experimentally examined evidence of cooperation in the ocellated wrasse (Symphodus ocellatus), a fish species with males that exercise three reproductive strategies: satellite and sneaker males attempt to parasitically spawn in the nests of nesting males. Nesting males have been hypothesized to tolerate satellites as a result of satellite aid in defense against sneaker males and help in courting females. Here, we provide evidence that cooperation between reproductive competitors may arise in response to spermcompetition from other males. After we experimentally removed satellites, nesting males had more sneakers at their nest and experienced a higher rate of sneaking when they spawned (increased sperm competition risk). When we experimentally distracted nesting males to prevent their acting aggressively toward satellites, satellites spawned with females and ate eggs in the nest. Our results suggest that nesting males and satellites gain fitness benefits of reduced direct reproductive and sperm competition through cooperation. However, nesting males risk losing paternity, while satellites experience increased aggression and must invest in aggression themselves (i.e., they act aggressively toward sneakers).

Here, we extend life-table response experiments (LTREs) to variable environments, showing how to quantify contributions made by (1) mean vital rates, (2) variability driven by environmental fluctuations, (3) correlations implying demographic trade-offs and reflecting stage transition synchrony, and (4) elasticities reflecting local selection pressures. Applying our methods to the lady's slipper orchid Cypripedium calceolus, we found that mean rates accounted for 77.1% of all effects on the stochastic growth rate, variability accounted for 12.6%, elasticities accounted for 6.6%, and correlations accounted for 3.7%. Stochastic effects accounted for 17.6%, 15.3%, and 35.9% of the total in our three populations. Larger elasticities to transitions between dormancy states and stronger correlations between emergence and survival suggest that one population was under greater pressure to remain active while the other two showed survival payoffs for dormancy in poor years. Strong negative correlations between dormancy, emergence, and stasis balanced opposing contributions, resulting in near stationarity in two populations. These new methods provide an additional tool for researchers investigating stochastic population dynamics and should be useful for a broad range of applications in basic ecology and conservation biology.

Early in the history of the Cambrian trilobite family Pterocephaliidae, there was an increase in taxonomic diversity and morphological diversity. As taxonomic diversity Decemberlined in the later history of the clade, range of variation stayed high and disparity continued to increase. However, per-branch rates of morphological evolution estimated from a recent phylogeny Decemberreased with time. Neither within-trait nor within-species variation increased or Decemberreased, suggesting that the Decemberlining rates of morphological evolution were more likely related to ecological opportunity or niche partitioning, rather than increasing intrinsic constraints. This is further supported by evidence for increased biofacies associations throughout the time period. Thus, the high disparity seen at low taxonomic diversity late in the history of this clade was due to extinction - either random or targeting mean forms - rather than increased rates of morphological evolution. This pattern also provides a scenario that could account for instances of low taxonomic diversity but high morphological disparity in modern groups.

We examined patterns of variation in adult growth using long-term Marchk-recapture data on 13 populations of 9 species representing 3 families of freshwater turtles located in South Carolina, Michigan, and Arizona in the USA and in Ontario, Canada. Across 13 study populations, growth rates of all adults and only those that grew averaged 1.5 and 1.9 mm/yr respectively. Sources of variation in growth rates included species, population, sex, age, and latitude. Most adults of both sexes with recapture intervals greater than 10 years grew, but across all populations an average of 19 % of individuals did not grow (some with recapture intervals up to 30 years). For known-age adults of three species, the highest growth rates occurred during the 10 years following sexual maturity, and the proportions of non-growing individuals increased with age. Growth rates of adults were on average 92 % lower than those of juveniles. Based on linear relationships of clutch size and body size of females at average juvenile and adult growth rates it would take 0.7 (0.2-1.2) years and 8.6 (min-max = 2.3-18.5) years, respectively, to grow enough to increase clutch size by one egg. The majority of within population variation in adult body size in 3 species appeared to be a combination of differences in ages at maturity and juvenile and early adult growth, rather than indeterminate growth. The results from our study populations indicate that increases in body size (and associated reproductive output) that results from indeterminate growth are not substantial enough to represent a major factor in the evolution of life histories in general or the evolution of longevity and aging specifically.

Distinguishing between such mechanisms requires, at the very least, information on the process by which genital morphology influences fertilization success. The length of the spermatophore-producing organ (SPO) of the stylommatophoran land snails is a case in point. The length of the spermatophore may have an important influence on the transfer of the spermatophore to the recipient's genital tract. To test this hypothesis, we investigated in Euhadra peliomphala (Pfeiffer, 1850) the relationship between the length of the SPO in sperm donors and the position of their spermatophore in sperm recipients at 72, 84, and 96h after mating. The results showed that longer spermatophores required longer times to reach a gametolytic organ and to begin to be digested. These findings suggest that this delay in spermatophore digestion explains the mechanism for the high fertilization success shown by snails with a long SPO.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London	June 22, 2013Rapidly fluctuating environments constrain coevolutionary arms races by impeding selective sweeps	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	host-parasite exploiter-victim natural enemy arms race experimental evolution antagonistic coevolution	HOST-PARASITOID INTERACTION ANTAGONISTIC COEVOLUTION PSEUDOMONAS-FLUORESCENS HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENTS GENETIC-POLYMORPHISM DYNAMICS EVOLUTION BACTERIOPHAGE IMPACT CROSSBILLS	Although pervasive, the impact of temporal environmental heterogeneity on coevolutionary processes is poorly understood. Productivity is a key temporally heterogeneous variable, and increasing productivity has been shown to increase rates of antagonistic arms race coevolution, and lead to the evolution of more broadly resistant hosts and more broadly infectious parasites. We investigated the effects of the grain of environmental heterogeneity, in terms of fluctuations in productivity, on bacteria-phage coevolution. Our findings demonstrate that environmental heterogeneity could constrain antagonistic coevolution, but that its effect was dependent upon the grain of heterogeneity, such that both the rate and extent of coevolution were most strongly limited in fine-grained, rapidly fluctuating heterogeneous environments. We further demonstrate that rapid environmental fluctuations were likely to have impeded selective sweeps of resistance alleles, which occurred over longer durations than the fastest, but not the slowest, frequency of fluctuations used. Taken together our results suggest that fine-grained environmental heterogeneity constrained the coevolutionary arms race by impeding selective sweeps.

The stickleback family is a good model with which to explore the ecological and genetic basis of parallel and nonparallel patterns of phenotypic evolution, because there are a variety of populations and species that are locally adapted to divergent environments. Although the patterns of phenotypic divergence as well as the genetic and ecological mechanisms have been well characterized in threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, we know little about the patterns of phenotypic diversification in other stickleback lineages. In eastern Hokkaido, Japan, there are three species of ninespine sticklebacks, Pungitius tymensis and the freshwater type and the brackish-water type of the P. pungitius-P. sinensis species complex. They utilize divergent habitats along coast-stream gradients of rivers. Here, we investigated genetic, ecological and phenotypic divergence among three species of Japanese ninespine sticklebacks. Divergence in trophic morphology and salinity tolerance occurred in the direction predicted by the patterns observed in threespine sticklebacks. However, the patterns of divergence in armour plate were different from those previously found in threespine sticklebacks. Furthermore, the genetic basis of plate variation may differ from that in threespine sticklebacks. Because threespine sticklebacks are well-established model for evolutionary research, the sympatric trio of ninespine sticklebacks will be an invaluable resource for ecological and genetic studies on both common and lineage-specific patterns of phenotypic diversification.

XYLANASE INHIBITOR PROTEIN CONSERVED SEQUENCE REGION AMINO-ACID TRANSPORTERS PHLOEM-FEEDING INSECT CULEX-PIPIENS DIPTERA MOLECULAR-CLONING PEA APHID	Although some alpha-glucosidases from the alpha-amylase family (glycoside hydrolase family GH13) have been studied extensively, their exact number, organization on the chromosome, and orthology/paralogy relationship were unknown. This was true even for important disease vectors where gut alpha-glucosidase is known to be receptor for the Bin toxin used to control the population of some mosquito species. In some cases orthologs from related species were studied intensively, while potentially important paralogs were omitted. We have, therefore, used a bioinformatics approach to identify all family GH13 alpha-glucosidases from the selected species from Metazoa (including three mosquito species: Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, and Culex quinquefasciatus) as well as from Fungi in an effort to characterize their arrangement on the chromosome and evolutionary relationships among orthologs and among paralogs. We also searched for pseudogenes and genes coding for enzymatically inactive proteins with a possible new function. We have found GH13 alpha-glucosidases mostly in Arthropoda and Fungi where they form gene families, as a result of multiple lineage-specific gene duplications. In mosquito species we have identified 14 alpha-glucosidase (Aglu) genes of which only five have been biochemically characterized so far, two are putative pseudogenes and the rest remains uncharacterized. We also revealed quite a complex evolutionary history of the eukaryotic alpha-glucosidases probably involving multiple losses of genes or horizontal gene transfer from bacteria.

Several possible processes have been hypothesized, including genetic drift, arbitrary sexual selection, and adaptation to local signaling environments. We use comparative analyses to investigate whether the reMarchkable geographic variation of dewlap phenotype in a Hispaniolan trunk Anolis lizard (A. distichus) is a result of adaptive signal divergence to heterogeneous environments. We recover a repeated pattern of divergence in A. distichus dewlap color, pattern, and size with environmental variation across Hispaniola. These results are aligned with ecological models of signal divergence and provide strong evidence for dewlap adaptation to local signaling environments. We also find that A. distichus dewlaps vary with the environment in a different manner to other previously studied anoles, thus expanding upon previous predictions on the direction dewlaps will diverge in perceptual color space in response to the environment.

Although two plastid regions have been adopted as the standard Marchkers for plant DNA barcoding, their limited resolution has provoked the consideration of other gene regions, especially in taxonomically diverse genera. The genus Gossypium (cotton) includes eight diploid genome groups (A-G, and K) and five allotetraploid species which are difficult to discriminate morphologically. In this study, we tested the effectiveness of three widely used Marchkers (matK, rbcL, and ITS2) in the discrimination of 20 diploid and five tetraploid species of cotton. Sequences were analysed locus-wise and in combinations to determine the most effective strategy for species identification. Sequence recovery was high, ranging from 92% to 100% with mean pairwise interspecific distance highest for ITS2 (3.68%) and lowest for rbcL (0.43%). At a 0.5% threshold, the combination of matK+ITS2 produced the greatest number of species clusters. Based on best match' analysis, the combination of matK+ITS2 was best, while based on all species barcodes' analysis, ITS2 gave the highest percentage of correct species identifications (98.93%). The combination of sequences for all three Marchkers produced the best resolved tree. The disparity index test based on matK+rbcL+ITS2 was significant (P<0.05) for a higher number of species pairs than the individual gene sequences. Although all three barcodes Septemberarated the species with respect to their genome type, no single combination of barcodes could differentiate all the Gossypium species, and tetraploid species were particularly difficult.

Surprisingly, only squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes) are capable of facilitating embryonic development to increasingly advanced stages inside the mother during extended periods of oviducal egg retention. Viviparity has never evolved in turtle lineages, presumably because embryos enter and remain in an arrested state until after eggs are laid, regardless of the duration of egg retention. Until now, the limiting factor that initiates and maintains developmental arrest has remained elusive. Here, we show that oviducal hypoxia arrests embryonic development. We demonstrate that hypoxia can maintain developmental arrest after oviposition and that subsequent exposure of arrested embryos to normoxia triggers resumption of their development. We discovered reMarchkably low oxygen partial pressure in the oviducts of gravid turtles and found that secretions produced by the oviduct retard oxygen diffusion. Our results suggest that an extremely hypoxic environment in the oviduct arrests embryonic development and may constrain the evolution of viviparity in turtles, with the reduced diffusive capacity of oviducal secretions possibly creating or contributing to this hypoxia. We anticipate that these findings will allow us to better understand the mechanisms underlying the evolutionary transition between reproductive modes.

Angiosperm nuclear genomes also encode maturases that are targeted to the organelles, but it is not known whether nucleus-encoded maturases exist in other land plant lineages. To examine the evolutionary diversity and history of this essential gene family, we searched for maturase homologs in recently sequenced nuclear and mitochondrial genomes from diverse land plants. We found that maturase content in mitochondrial genomes is highly lineage specific, such that orthologous maturases are rarely shared among major land plant groups. The presence of numerous mitochondrial pseudogenes in the mitochondrial genomes of several species implies that the sporadic maturase distribution is due to frequent inactivation and eventual loss over time. We also identified multiple maturase paralogs in the nuclear genomes of the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii, the moss Physcomitrella patens, and the representative angiosperm Vitis vinifera. Phylogenetic analyses of organelle- and nucleus-encoded maturases revealed that the nuclear maturase genes in angiosperms, lycophytes, and mosses arose by multiple shared and independent transfers of mitochondrial paralogs to the nuclear genome during land plant evolution. These findings indicate that plant mitochondrial maturases have experienced a surprisingly dynamic history due to a complex interaction of multiple evolutionary forces that affect the rates of maturase gain, retention, and loss.

Leptocleidids have often been interpreted as basal members of Pliosauroidea, and their presence in Marchginal Marchine and even freshwater facies has led to suggestions that they might represent late-surviving relicts, perhaps related to the Lower Jurassic rhomaleosaurids. We describe a new leptocleidid, Vectocleidus pastorum gen. et sp. November., from the late Barremian part of the Cowleaze Chine Member (Vectis Formation), Isle of Wight, UK, and undertake a detailed reassessment of leptocleidid anatomy and relationships. New data on the long-necked Brancasaurus gives extra support to a monophyletic Leptocleididae with taxa of intermediate' body plan and robust skulls, Leptocleidus superstes, Leptocleidus capensis, Nichollssaura and Vectocleidus. Thus, leptocleidids adopted a range of body plans on the pliosauromorphplesiosauromorph spectrum. Support for a placement of Leptocleididae within Pliosauroidea is weak, and most proposed synapomorphies fail the test of similarity. However, numerous synapomorphies, including many new observations, support a derived position within Plesiosauroidea. Thus, the intermediate' body plan of many leptocleidids is not plesiomorphic, and plesiosaurian body plan evolution was complex and highly plastic. We also sumMarchize the anatomy of Cimoliasaurus' valdensis, a short-necked Early Cretaceous taxon. C.' valdensis is a valid taxon for which we erect the new monotypic genus Hastanectes. Hastanectes shows evidence of possible pliosaurid affinities. Thus, multiple plesiosaurian clades may have invaded Marchgin and freshwater environments. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:8A0A8BD0-F6BB-4F74-BB18-79CBBA2F105C	June 22, 2013Recurrent functional divergence of early tetrapod keratins in amphibian toe pads and mammalian hair	BIOLOGY LETTERS	amphibia toe pad keratins	DIGITAL PADS MIXED MODELS TREE FROGS	Amphibians have invaded arboreal habitats multiple times independently during their evolution. Adaptation to these habitats was nearly always accompanied by the presence or appearance of toe pads, flattened enlargements on tips of fingers and toes that provide adhesive power in these environments. The strength and elasticity of the toe pad relies on polygonal arrayed cells ending in nanoscale projections, which are densely packed with cytoskeletal proteins. Here, we characterized and determined the evolutionary origin of these proteins in the toe pad of the tree frog Hyla cinerea. We created a subtracted cDNA library enriching genes that are expressed in the toe pad, but nowhere else in the toe. Our analyses revealed five alpha keratins as main structural proteins of the amphibian toe pad. Phylogenetic analyses show that these proteins belong to different keratin lineages that originated in an early tetrapod ancestor and in mammals evolved to become the major keratin types of hair. The ancestral keratins were probably already expressed in areas that required skin reinforcement in early tetrapods, and subsequently diverged to support fundamentally different adaptive structures in amphibians and mammals.

In this study, we explored and discussed the use of the network analysis method (NAM) and neighbor-joining (NJ) to analyze the areas of endemism of Quercus sect. Lobatae (red oak species) in Mexico and Central America. We compared the NAM and NJ with other methods commonly used in biogeographic studies to show the advantages of these new approaches and to identify the shortcomings of other approaches. The NAM used in this study is based on notions of centrality measures, such as betweenness. We incorporated the strength of the ties within the internal networks through p-cores and aggregate constraints in iterative analyses. The NAM based on betweenness is ideal for recognizing completely allopatric areas of endemism. The iterative NAMs increase the number of possible areas of endemism because they minimize the effect of minimal overlap, and the p-core is efficient at identifying the closest relationships among species in the cases in which betweenness is not informative. The number of areas of endemism increases when the sympatry matrix minimizes the dispersal effect and the sample effort is maximized, allowing the identification of the greatest number of these areas. The NJ method supports the idea that areas diverge among themselves in a differential way the long branches correspond to zones with high speciation rates and complex histories (biotic and tectonic), and the short branches correspond to zones with low speciation rates and simple histories. In a classification scheme, NJ was capable of identifying the areas that are considered biotically complex because of their high speciation rates. The results obtained with the NAM and NJ showed that the physiographic regions of Mexico are not natural units and that many of them are composed of at least two different biotic components.

In the simplest case, unlinked loci and uncorrelated phenotypes respond directly to multivariate selection and permit unrestricted paths to adaptive peaks. By contrast, 'antagonistic' pleiotropic loci may constrain adaptation by affecting variation of many traits and limiting the direction of trait correlations to vectors that are not favoured by selection. However, certain pleiotropic configurations may improve the conditions for adaptive evolution. Here, we present evidence that the Arabidopsis thaliana gene FRI (FRIGIDA) exhibits 'adaptive' pleiotropy, producing trait correlations along an axis that results in two adaptive strategies. Derived, low-expression FRI alleles confer a 'drought escape' strategy owing to fast growth, low water use efficiency and early flowering. By contrast, a dehydration avoidance strategy is conferred by the ancestral phenotype of late flowering, slow growth and efficient water use during photosynthesis. The dehydration avoidant phenotype was recovered when genotypes with null FRI alleles were transformed with functional alleles. Our findings indicate that the well-documented effects of FRI on phenology result from differences in physiology, not only a simple developmental switch.

From negative to positive SGDCs have been reported, but studies have generally not quantified the processes underlying these correlations. They were also mostly conducted at large biogeographical scales or in recently degraded habitats. Such correlations have not been looked for in natural networks of connected habitat fragments (metacommunities), and the underlying processes remain elusive in most systems. We investigated these issues by studying freshwater snails in a pond network in Guadeloupe (Lesser Antilles). We recorded SD and habitat characteristics in 232 ponds and assessed GD in 75 populations of two species. Strongly significant and positive SGDCs were detected in both species. Based on a Decemberomposition of SGDC as a function of variance-covariance of habitat characteristics, we showed that connectivity (opportunity of water flow between a site and the nearest watershed during the rainy season) has the strongest contribution on SGDCs. More connective sites received both more alleles and more species through immigration resulting in both higher GD and higher SD. Other habitat characteristics did not contribute, or contributed negatively, to SGDCs. This is true of the desiccation frequency of ponds during the dry season, presumably because species Marchkedly differ in their ability to tolerate desiccation. Our study shows that variation in environmental characteristics of habitat patches can promote SGDCs at metacommunity scale when the studied species respond homogeneously to these environmental characteristics.

We examined how the presence and sex of an audience influenced aggression and victory display behaviour in field-captured and laboratory-reared field crickets (Gryllus veletis). Audience type, rearing environment and their interaction were important predictors in all model sets. Thus, audience type may impose different costs and benefits for competing males depending on whether they are socially experienced or not. Our results suggest that field-captured winners, in particular, dynamically adjust their contest behaviour to potentially gain a reproductive benefit via female eavesdropping and may deter future aggression from rivals by advertising their aggressiveness and victories.

Here, we provide a comparative analysis of de Novembero-assembled transcriptomes in two Mediterranean earthworm species with the objective to detect pheromone proteins and other reproductive genes that could be involved in cryptic speciation processes, as recently characterized in other earthworm species. cDNA libraries of unspecific tissue of Hormogaster samnitica and three different tissues of H. elisae were sequenced in an Illumina Genome Analyzer II or Hi-Seq. Two pheromones, Attractin and Temptin were detected in all tissue samples and both species. Attractin resulted in a reliable Marchker for phylogenetic inference. Temptin contained multiple paralogs and was slightly overexpressed in the digestive tissue, suggesting that these pheromones could be released with the casts. Genes involved in sexual determination and fertilization were highly expressed in reproductive tissue. This is thus the first detailed analysis of the molecular machinery of sexual reproduction in earthworms.

This issue is particularly relevant for species of conservation concern including many amphibians, which are experiencing global Decemberlines from many causes including widespread exposure to agrochemicals. We used a laboratory toxicity experiment to assess variation in sensitivity to two pesticides among wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) populations and a mesocosm experiment to ascertain whether resistance to pesticides is associated with Decemberreased performance when animals experience competition and fear of predation. We discovered that wood frog populations closer to agriculture were more resistant to a common insecticide (chlorpyrifos), but not to a common herbicide (Roundup). We also found no evidence that this resistance carried a performance cost when facing competition and the fear of predation. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that organophosphate insecticide (the most commonly applied class of insecticides in the world) resistance increases with agricultural land use in an amphibian, which is consistent with an evolutionary response to agrochemicals.

Here we provide a molecular phylogeny of this poorly understood taxon using combined analyses of mitochondria] (CYTB, COIII, 12S, 16S) and nuclear (KCAS, SPTBN1, PRKCI, MC1R, THYR ) genes. We explore the influence of data partitioning and different analytical methods, including Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony, on the inferred relationships within Antilopini. We achieve increased resolution and support compared to previous analyses especially in the two most problematic parts of their tree. First, taxa commonly referred to as gazelles are recovered as paraphyletic, as the genus Gazella appears more closely related to the Indian blackbuck (Antilope cervicAprila) than to the other two gazelle genera (Nanger and Eudorcas). Second, we recovered a strongly supported sister relationship between one of the dwarf antelopes (Ourebia) and the Antilopini subgroup Antilopina (Saiga, Gerenuk, Springbok, Blackbuck and gazelles). The assessment of the influence of taxon sampling, out-group rooting, and data partitioning in Bayesian analyses helps explain the contradictory results of previous studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

For this study, we developed an efficient method for sequencing anuran mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) by amplifying the mitochondrial genome in 12 overlapping fragments using frog-specific universal primer sets. Based on this method, we generated 47 nearly complete, new anuran mitochondrial genomes and discovered nine Novemberel gene arrangements. By combining the new data and published anuran mitochondrial genomes, we assembled a large mitogenomic data set (11,007 nt) including 90 frog species, representing 39 of 53 recognized anuran families, to investigate their phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history. The resulting tree strongly supported a paraphyletic arrangement of archaeobatrachian (=nonneobatrachian) frogs, with Leiopelmatoidea branching first, followed by Discoglossoidea, Pipoidea, and Pelobatoidea. Within Neobatrachia, the South African Heleophrynidae is the sister-taxon to all other neobatrachian frogs and the Seychelles-endemic Sooglossidae is recovered as the sister-taxon to Ranoidea. These phylogenetic relationships agree with many nuclear gene studies. The chronogram derived from two Bayesian relaxed clock methods (MultiDivTime and BEAST) suggests that modern frogs (Anura) originated in the early Triassic about 244 Ma and the appearance of Neobatrachia took place in the late Jurassic about 163 Ma. The initial diversifications of two species-rich superfamilies Hyloidea and Ranoidea commenced 110 and 133 Ma, respectively. These times are older than some other estimates by approximately 30-40 My. Compared with nuclear data, mtDNA produces compatible time estimates for deep nodes (>150 Ma), but apparently older estimates for more shallow nodes. Our study shows that, although it evolves relatively rapidly and behaves much as a single locus, mtDNA performs well for both phylogenetic and divergence time inferences and will provide important reference hypotheses for the phylogeny and evolution of frogs.

We analyzed and compared sporogenesis and gametogenesis in the apomictic Miconia albicans and the sexual M. chamissois. The results point to some differences between species, which were related to the apomictic process. In M. albicans microsporogenesis, problems during meiosis and degeneration of its products led to total pollen sterility, while M. chamissois presented normal bicellular pollen grains in the mature anther. The absence or abnormality of meiosis in M. albicans megasporogenesis led to the formation of an unreduced embryo sac and also to egg cell parthenogenesis, which gave rise to the apomictic embryo. Embryo and endosperm development were autonomous, resulting in seeds and fruits independent of pollination and fertilization. Thus, in this species, apomixis can be classified as diplosporic and obligate. In contrast, meiosis was as expected in the sexual M. chamissois, and led to the development of a reduced embryo sac. Despite the divergent pathways, many embryological characteristics were similar between the studied species and other Melastomataceae and they seem to be conservative character states for the family.

Here we investigate the contributions of these two selective forces on the aposematic signal evolution of the highly polytypic strawberry poison frog, Oophaga pumilio, of Bocas del Toro, Panama. Previous research has shown that the brightness of O. pumilio warning coloration can inform predators of the toxicity levels associated with different populations of the archipelago. Other studies suggest that sexual selection may be influencing warning signal brightness within populations via female mate choice (Isla Solarte, Isla Bastimentos, and Aquacate Peninsula populations) and male-male competition (Isla Solarte). Here we present two non-exclusive scenarios for how natural and sexual selection interact to drive phenotypic variation across this archipelago: (1) predators impose a selective regime whereby populations above a toxicity-brightness threshold are at liberty to diversify via sexual selection and below which populations are constrained to maintain a stricter resemblance to a more cryptic population mean, and (2) synergistic/additive effects of inter- and intrasexual selection drive the evolution of brighter males within populations above this toxicity threshold. We investigate whether aposematic patterns of divergence across the archipelago relative to the common mainland phenotype meet these predictions using existing data on O. pumilio morph toxicity measures and overall conspicuousness estimates to an avian predator. Using standardized z-scores to evaluate the range of trait values, we find that indeed the population representative of the common mainland phenotype (Almirante) represents an intermediate level of both toxicity and conspicuousness, and that derived Bocas del Toro populations vary in each of those components in directions predicted by the proposed scenarios. Furthermore, we find greater divergence towards conspicuousness than crypsis, a pattern suggestive of sexual and natural selection acting synergistically in morphs with high toxicity.

Functional explanations of such phenomena are essential we argue that recent proposals, focused on benefits from overestimating the probability of success in conflicts or practising self-Decembereption to better Decembereive others, are still lacking in crucial regards. Attention must be paid to the difference between cognitive and outcome biases outcome biases are suboptimal, yet cognitive biases can be optimal. However, given that cognitive biases are subjectively experienced by affected individuals, developing theory and collecting evidence on them poses challenges. An evolutionary theory of cognitive bias might require closer integration of function and mechanism, analysing the evolution of constraints imposed by the mechanisms that determine behaviour.

Based on the approach of Ovaskainen etal. (2011), we have developed an R package (driftsel) that can be used to differentiate between stabilizing selection, diversifying selection and random genetic drift as causes of population differentiation in quantitative traits when neutral Marchker and quantitative genetic data are available. Apart from illustrating the use of this method and the interpretation of results using simulated data, we apply the package on data from three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to highlight its virtues. driftsel can also be used to perform usual quantitative genetic analyses in common-garden study designs.

Currently, the genus includes two extraordinary species, characterized by strongly discoidal tails. Both species are only known from a few localities in north-eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia and are represented by a small number of specimens in museum collections. Morphological and mitochondrial (16S) DNA sequence data revealed that Xenagama batillifera is a complex of two cryptic species and the reassignment of Acanthocercus zonurus to the genus Xenagama is supported by morphological analyses. Herein, we describe specimens previously recognized as a geographic variant of X.batillifera as a new species and compare it to other whorl-tailed lizards of the genera Xenagama and Acanthocercus from the Horn of Africa, underscoring the significance of this poorly known but important region for agamid evolution. Among other features, the new species is characterized by possessing heterogeneous body scalation, no nuchal crest and no tufts of elongated scales around the ear. Similar to Xenagama batillifera or Xenagama taylori, and distinct to other African agamid lizards, the tail is shorter than the body and head, but the tail base is less discoidal than in X.batillifera or especially X.taylori and gradually merges into the terminal filament. The discoidal part of the tail is arranged in whorls with one scale ring each, whereas the filament is not distinctly whorled.

SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY		VESPIDA AGE	Archoxyelyda mirabilis gen.n. and sp.n., is described from the Yixian Formation of Liaoning Province, China. It is placed in the family Praesiricidae based on the loss of forewing Sc. The fossil is placed in Archoxyelydinae subfam.n. based on a modified antennal flagellum (consisting of two distinct multisegmented parts: a thick and tightly connected basal part, and a thin and more loosely articulated distal one). The incompletely preserved genus Xyelydontes Rasnitsyn, 1983 is tentatively transferred to Archoxyelydinae. The new material demonstrates a unique feature in the antennal anatomy: the composite third antennomere can be seen to consist of tightly connected priMarchy antennomeres. Antennal evolution in the lower Hymenoptera is reviewed and three hypothetical pathways in their transformation are discussed.

One force is analogous to selection, and acts on differences in the fitness of aspects of culture by influencing who people choose to learn from. Another force is analogous to mutation, and influences how culture changes over time owing to errors in learning and the effects of cognitive biases. Which of these forces need to be appealed to in explaining any particular aspect of human cultures is an open question. We present a study that explores this question empirically, examining the role that the cognitive biases that influence cultural transmission might play in universals of colour naming. In a large-scale laboratory experiment, participants were shown labelled examples from Novemberel artificial systems of colour terms and were asked to classify other colours on the basis of those examples. The responses of each participant were used to generate the examples seen by subsequent participants. By simulating cultural transmission in the laboratory, we were able to isolate a single evolutionary force-the effects of cognitive biases, analogous to mutation-and examine its consequences. Our results show that this process produces convergence towards systems of colour terms similar to those seen across human languages, providing support for the conclusion that the effects of cognitive biases, brought out through cultural transmission, can account for universals in colour naming.

Even so, asexual females from a variety of animal taxa occasionally produce males. The existence of these males sets the stage for potential gene flow across asexual lineages as well as between sexual and asexual lineages. A recent study showed that asexual triploid female Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a New Zealand freshwater snail often used as a model to study sexual reproduction, occasionally produce triploid male offspring. Here, we show that these triploid male P.antipodarum (1) have testes that produce morphologically normal sperm, (2) make larger sperm cells that contain more nuclear DNA than the sperm produced by diploid sexual males, and (3) produce sperm that range in DNA content from haploid to diploid, and are often aneuploid. Analysis of meiotic chromosomes of triploid males showed that aberrant pairing during prophase I probably accounts for the high variation in DNA content among sperm. These results indicate that triploid male P.antipodarum produce sperm, but the extent to which these sperm are able to fertilize female ova remains unclear. Our results also suggest that the general assumption of sterility in triploid males should be more closely examined in other species in which such males are occasionally produced.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 227-234.

Alooideae (Asparagales) currently comprises five genera, four of which are endemic to southern Africa. Despite their importance in commercial horticulture the evolutionary relationships among the genera are still incompletely understood. This study examines phylogenetic relationships in the subfamily using an expanded molecular sequence dataset from three plastid regions (matK, rbcLa, trnH-psbA) and the first subunit of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS1). Sequence data were analysed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian statistics, and selected morphological traits were mapped onto the molecular phylogeny. Haworthia is confirmed as being polyphyletic, comprising three main clades that largely correlate with current subgeneric circumscriptions. Astroloba and Gasteria are evidently each monophyletic and sister respectively to Astroloba and H. subg. Robust ipedunculares. Chortolirion is shown to be deeply nested within Aloe and is formally included in that genus. Aloe itself is clearly polyphyletic, with the dwarf species A. aristata allied to Haworthia subg. Robustipedunculares. The taxonomic implications of these findings are examined but branch support at critical lower nodes is insufficient at this stage to justify implementing major taxonomic changes.

But while clinical analyses have examined aspects of temporal bone ontogeny in humans, the ontogeny of the temporal bone in non-human taxa is less well documented. This study examines ontogenetic allometry of the temporal bone in order to address several research questions related to the pattern and trajectory of temporal bone shape change during ontogeny in the African apes and humans. We further apply these data to a preliminary analysis of temporal bone ontogeny in Australopithecus afarensis. Three-dimensional landMarchks were digitized on an ontogenetic series of specimens of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, and Gorilla gorilla. Data were analyzed using geometric morphometric methods, and shape changes throughout ontogeny in relation to size were compared. Results of these analyses indicate that, despite broadly similar patterns, African apes and humans show Marchked differences in development of the mandibular fossa and tympanic portions of the temporal bone. These findings indicate divergent, rather than parallel, postnatal ontogenetic allometric trajectories for temporal bone shape in these taxa. The pattern of temporal bone shape change with size exhibited by A. afarensis showed some affinities to that of humans, but was most similar to extant African apes, particularly Gorilla.

That letter from Ternate in the Malay Archipelago, however, was not the first letter Darwin received from Wallace. This article will contend that two of the three letters Wallace sent Darwin between 10 Octoberober 1856 and 9 Marchch 1858 arrived much earlier than Darwin recorded, thereby allowing him time to assess Wallace's ideas and claim an independent understanding of how the operation of divergence and extinction in the natural world leads strongly Marchked varieties to be identified as new species. By the time of the Linnean meeting Darwin's new ideas had filtered into his letters and big' species book, despite the absence of any independent evidence from the natural world to justify his constant insistence to have been guided only by inductive reasoning.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 725-736.

Here we test the hypothesis that high auto-infection, as observed for leaf infecting fungal pathogens, could select for short latent periods. An individual-based simulation model keeps track of lesions, resulting from the spread of spores, between and within individual leaves. Linked to a trade-off between latent period and spore production capacity, as observed for Puccinia triticina on wheat, the adaptation of the latent period is analysed for different levels of auto-infection using the methods of pairwise invasibility plots. Results suggest that increased auto-infection selects for reduced latent periods. A reduction in leaf longevity also selects for reduced latent periods, which is most obvious for a relatively low ratio of auto- to allo-infection. This study is the first to consider the effect of auto-infection on the evolution of pathogen life history traits. The fact that auto-infection could drastically reduce pathogen latent periods highlights the need for more research in this area.	June 22, 2013Does chemical defence increase niche space? A phylogenetic comparative analysis of the Musteloidea	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY	Ecological opportunity Antipredator mechanisms Behavioural constraints Natural enemies	MALAGASY POISON FROGS ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR CORRELATED EVOLUTION DISCRETE CHARACTERS BEETLES COLEOPTERA WARNING COLORATION BODY-SIZE APOSEMATISM CARNIVORA DIVERSIFICATION	Avoidance of predation can impose opportunity costs on prey species that use behavioural avoidance strategies to evade detection. An animal that spends much time hiding or remaining immobile, for example, may have less time for other important activities such as foraging or finding mates. Here we examine the idea that the evolution of chemical defence may act to release prey from these constraints, freeing defended prey to exploit their habitats more effectively, and increasing their niche space. We tested this hypothesis using comparative methods on a mammal group containing both chemically defended and non-defended species: Musteloidea. We found that defended species had a more omnivorous diet and were more likely to be active during both day and night than non-defended species. We also found that chemically defended species were less likely to be strictly diurnal or to show sexual size dimorphism, and had earlier maturing females and a shorter lifespan than non-defended species. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that chemical defence increases the niche space available to a species. More generally, this also supports recent suggestions that strategies taken to avoid natural enemies can have important effects on diverse components of life history.

However, contrary to point mutations (substitutions), our knowledge of the evolution and structural-functional effects of InDels is limited and so is our capability to engineer them. We sought to assess how deleterious InDels are relative to point mutations and understand the mechanisms that mediate their acceptance. Analysis of the evolution of InDels in orthologous protein phylogenies indicated that their rate of purging is 9- to 100-fold higher than for point mutations. In yeast, for example, the substitutions-to-InDels ratio is approximately 14-fold higher in protein coding than in noncoding regions. The incorporation of InDels relative to substitutions is not only slow but also nonlinear. On average, epsilon 50 substitutions accumulate before the appearance of the first InDel. We also found enriched substitutions in sequential and spatial proximity to InDels, suggesting that certain substitutions are correlated with InDels. As indicated by the lag in InDels accumulation, some of these correlated substitutions may have occurred first, as apparently neutral mutations, and later enabled the accumulation of InDels that would be otherwise purged. Thus, compensatory substitutions may follow InDels in an adaptive walk as traditionally assumed, but might also accumulate first, by neutral roaming. The dynamics of InDels accumulation also depends on their genomic frequencies-InDels in flies are 4-fold more frequent than in yeast and tend to be compensated rather than enabled.

This phenomenon culminates in the radiations of cichlid fishes in the African Great Lakes. Multiple characteristic traits of cichlids, targeted by natural or sexual selection, are considered among the driving factors of these radiations. Parasites and pathogens have been suggested to initiate or accelerate speciation by triggering both natural and sexual selection. Three prerequisites for parasite-driven speciation can be inferred from ecological speciation theory. The first prerequisite is that different populations experience divergent infection levels. The second prerequisite is that these infection levels cause divergent selection and facilitate adaptive divergence. The third prerequisite is that parasite-driven adaptive divergence facilitates the evolution of reproductive isolation. Here we investigate the first and the second prerequisite in allopatric chromatically differentiated lineages of the rock-dwelling cichlid Tropheus spp. from southern Lake Tanganyika (Central Africa). Macroparasite communities were screened in eight populations belonging to five different colour morphs. Results: Parasite communities were mainly composed of acanthocephalans, nematodes, monogeneans, copepods, branchiurans, and digeneans. In two consecutive years (2011 and 2012), we observed significant variation across populations for infection with acanthocephalans, nematodes, monogeneans of the genera Gyrodactylus and Cichlidogyrus, and the copepod Ergasilus spp. Overall, parasite community composition differed significantly between populations of different colour morphs. Differences in parasite community composition were stable in time. The genetic structure of Tropheus populations was strong and showed a significant isolation-by-distance pattern, confirming that spatial isolation is limiting host dispersal. Correlations between parasite community composition and Tropheus genetic differentiation were not significant, suggesting that host dispersal does not influence parasite community diversification. Conclusions: Subject to alternating episodes of isolation and secondary contact because of lake level fluctuations, Tropheus colour morphs are believed to accumulate and maintain genetic differentiation through a combination of vicariance, philopatric behaviour and mate discrimination. Provided that the observed contrasts in parasitism facilitate adaptive divergence among populations in allopatry (which is the current situation), and promote the evolution of reproductive isolation during episodes of sympatry, parasites might facilitate speciation in this genus.

The overlapping genes in eukaryotes are extensively rearranged even between closely related species. In this study, we investigated retention and rearrangement of positionally overlapping genes between the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti (dengue virus vector) and Anopheles gambiae (malaria vector). The overlapping gene pairs of A. aegypti were further compared with orthologs of other selected insects to conduct several hypothesis driven investigations relating to the evolution and rearrangement of overlapping genes. Results: The results show that as much as similar to 10% of the predicted genes of A. aegypti and A. gambiae are localized in positional overlapping manner. Furthermore, the study shows that differential abundance of introns and simple sequence repeats have significant association with positional rearrangement of overlapping genes between the two species. Gene expression analysis further suggests that antisense transcripts generated from the oppositely oriented overlapping genes are differentially regulated and may have important regulatory functions in these mosquitoes. Our data further shows that synonymous and non-synonymous mutations have differential but non-significant effect on overlapping localization of orthologous genes in other insect genomes. Conclusion: Gene overlapping in insects may be a species-specific evolutionary process as evident from non-dependency of gene overlapping with species phylogeny. Based on the results, our study suggests that overlapping genes may have played an important role in genome evolution of insects.

Because anurans are not vocal learners, their vocalizations are generally assumed to have a strong genetic component. This suggests that the degree of similarity between advertisement calls may be related to large-scale phylogenetic relationships. To test this hypothesis, advertisement calls from 90 species belonging to four large clades (Bufo, Hylinae, Leptodactylus, and Rana) were analyzed. Phylogenetic distances were estimated based on the DNA sequences of the 12S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA gene, and, for a subset of 49 species, on the rhodopsin gene. Mean values for five acoustic parameters (coefficient of variation of root-mean-square amplitude, dominant frequency, spectral flux, spectral irregularity, and spectral flatness) were computed for each species. We then tested for phylogenetic signal on the body-size-corrected residuals of these five parameters, using three statistical tests (Moran's I, Mantel, and Blomberg's K) and three models of genetic distance (pairwise distances, Abouheif's proximities, and the variance-covariance matrix derived from the phylogenetic tree). Results: A significant phylogenetic signal was detected for most acoustic parameters on the 12S dataset, across statistical tests and genetic distance models, both for the entire sample of 90 species and within clades in several cases. A further analysis on a subset of 49 species using genetic distances derived from rhodopsin and from 12S broadly confirmed the results obtained on the larger sample, indicating that the phylogenetic signals observed in these acoustic parameters can be detected using a variety of genetic distance models derived either from a variable mitochondrial sequence or from a conserved nuclear gene. Conclusions: We found a robust relationship, in a large number of species, between anuran phylogenetic relatedness and acoustic similarity in the advertisement calls in a taxon with no evidence for vocal learning, even after correcting for the effect of body size. This finding, covering a broad sample of species whose vocalizations are fairly diverse, indicates that the intense selection on certain call characteristics observed in many anurans does not eliminate all acoustic indicators of relatedness. Our approach could potentially be applied to other vocal taxa.

Our previous work implies that annelids evolved unrelated appendage-forming mechanisms we therefore found no support for homology of parapodia and arthropodia at the level of the whole appendage. We expand on that study here by asking whether expression of the LIM homeobox (Lhx) genes apterous and lim1 in the annelid Neanthes arenaceodentata supports homology of the dorsal branches as well as the proximodistal axes of parapodia and arthropodia. In addition, we explore whether the neural expression of apterous and lim1 in Neanthes supports the putative ancestral function of the Lhx gene family in regulating the differentiation and maintenance of neuronal subtypes. Results: Both genes exhibit continuous expression in specific portions of the developing central nervous system, from hatching to at least the 13-chaetiger stage. For example, nerve cord expression occurs in segmentally iterated patterns consisting of diffuse sets of many lim1-positive cells and comparatively fewer, clustered pairs of apterous-positive cells. Additionally, continuous apterous expression is observed in presumed neurosecretory ganglia of the posterior brain, while lim1 is continuously expressed in stomatogastric ganglia of the anterior brain. apterous is also expressed in the jaw sacs, dorsal parapodial muscles, and a presumed pair of cephalic sensory organs, whereas lim1 is expressed in multiple pharyngeal ganglia, the segmental peripheral nervous system, neuropodial chaetal sac muscles, and parapodial ligules. Conclusions: The early and persistent nervous system expression of apterous and lim1 in Neanthes juveniles supports conservation of Lhx function in bilaterian neural differentiation and maintenance. Our results also suggest that diversification of parapodial muscle precursors involves a complementary LIM code similar to those generating distinct neuronal identities in fly and mouse nerve cords. Expression of apterous and lim1 in discrete components of developing parapodia is intriguing but does not map to comparable expression of these genes in developing arthropod appendages. Thus, annelid and arthropod appendage development apparently evolved, in part, via distinct co-option of the neuronal regulatory architecture. These divergent patterns of apterous and lim1 activity seemingly reflect de Novembero origins of parapodia and arthropodia, although we discuss alternative hypotheses.

One prominent example of bacterial adaptation is antibiotic resistance. Until recently, the paradigm has been that antibiotic resistance is selected by the presence of antibiotics because resistant mutations confer fitness costs in antibiotic free environments. In this study we show that it is not always the case, documenting the selection and fixation of resistant mutations in populations of Escherichia coli B that had never been exposed to antibiotics but instead evolved for 2000 generations at high temperature (42.2 degrees C). Results: We found parallel mutations within the rpoB gene encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase. These amino acid substitutions conferred different levels of rifampicin resistance. The resistant mutations typically appeared, and were fixed, early in the evolution experiment. We confirmed the high advantage of these mutations at 42.2 degrees C in glucose-limited medium. However, the rpoB mutations had different fitness effects across three genetic backgrounds and six environments. Conclusions: We describe resistance mutations that are not necessarily costly in the absence of antibiotics or compensatory mutations but are highly beneficial at high temperature and low glucose. Their fitness effects depend on the environment and the genetic background, providing glimpses into the prevalence of epistasis and pleiotropy.

To gain insights into the interaction between these dual selective factors, we used populations from a coevolution experiment with the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, and its microsporidian parasite, Nosema whitei. We maintained each experimental population at two different population sizes. We assayed the mating behaviour of both males and females from coevolved and paired non-coevolved control populations after 24 generations of coevolution with parasites. Results: Males from large, coevolved populations (i.e. ancestors were exposed to parasites) showed a reduced eagerness to mate compared to males from large, non-coevolved populations. But in small populations, coevolution did not lead to Decemberreased male mating rates. Coevolved females from both large and small populations appeared to be more willing to accept mating than non-coevolved females. Conclusions: This study provides unique, experimental insights into the combined roles of coevolving parasites and population size on the evolution of mating rate. Furthermore, we find that males and females respond differently to the same environmental conditions. Our results show that parasites can be key determinants of the sexual behaviour of their hosts.

Their phylogenetic distributions have traditionally been regarded as highly conserved. However, the complicated nature of acquiring spectral sensitivities from cone photoreceptors meant that until recently, only a few species had actually been studied. Whether birds are UVS or VS can nowadays be inferred from a wide range of species via genomic sequencing of the UV/violet SWS1 cone opsin gene. Results: We present genomic sequencing results of the SWS1 gene from 21 avian orders. Amino acid residues signifying UV sensitivity are found in the two most important spectral tuning sites 86 and 90 of Pteroclidiformes and Coraciiformes, in addition to the major clades, Palaeognathae, Charadriiformes, Trogoniformes, Psittaciformes and Passeriformes, where they where previously known to occur. We confirm that the presumed UVS-conferring amino acid combination F86, C90 and M93 is common to Palaeognathae and unique to this clade, despite available spectrometric evidence showing the ostrich retina to be VS. Conclusions: By mapping our results together with data from previous studies on a molecular phylogeny we show that avian colour vision shifted between VS and UVS at least 14 times. Single nucleotide substitutions can explain all these shifts. The common ancestor of birds most likely had a VS phenotype. However, the ancestral state of the avian SWS1 opsin's spectral tuning sites cannot be resolved, since the Palaeognathae are F86, C90 while the Neognathae are ancestrally S86, S90. The phylogenetic distribution of UVS and VS colour vision in birds is so complex that inferences of spectral sensitivities from closely related taxa should be used with caution.

In this study, we have assessed the effects of 16 different biological features on the evolutionary rates (ERs) of protein-coding sequences in bacterial genomes. Results: Our analysis of 18 bacterial species revealed new correlations between ERs and constraining factors. Previous studies have suggested that transcriptional abundance overwhelmingly constrains the evolution of yeast protein sequences. This transcriptional abundance leads to selection against misfolding or misinteractions. In this study we found that there was no single factor in determining the evolution of bacterial proteins. Not only transcriptional abundance (codon adaptation index and expression level), but also protein-protein associations (PPAs), essentiality (ESS), subcellular localization of cytoplasmic membrane (SLM), transmembrane helices (TMH) and hydropathicity score (HS) independently and significantly affected the ERs of bacterial proteins. In some species, PPA and ESS demonstrate higher correlations with ER than transcriptional abundance. Conclusions: Different forces drive the evolution of protein sequences in yeast and bacteria. In bacteria, the constraints are involved in avoiding a build-up of toxic molecules caused by misfolding/misinteraction (transcriptional abundance), while retaining important functions (ESS, PPA) and maintaining the cell membrane (SLM, TMH and HS). Each of these independently contributes to the variation in protein evolution.

Although empirical evidence shows that the tendency to disperse varies among individuals in many organisms, the evolution of dispersal patterns is not fully understood. Previous theoretical studies have shown that condition-dependent dispersal may evolve as a means to move to a different environment when environments are heterogeneous in space or in time. However, dispersal is also a means to genetically diversify offspring, a genetic advantage that might be particularly important when the individual fitness is low. We suggest that plasticity in dispersal, in which fit individuals are less likely to disperse (Fitness-Associated Dispersal, or FAD), can evolve due to its evolutionary advantages even when the environment is homogeneous and stable, kin competition is weak, and the cost of dispersal is high. Results: Using stochastic simulations we show that throughout the parameter range, selection favors FAD over uniform dispersal (in which all individuals disperse with equal probability). FAD also has significant long-term effects on the mean fitness and genotypic variance of the population. Conclusions: We show that FAD evolves under a very wide parameter range, regardless of its effects on the population mean fitness. We predict that individuals of low quality will have an increased tendency for dispersal, even when the environment is homogeneous, there is no direct competition with neighbors, and dispersal carries significant costs.	June 22, 2013Potential use of low-copy nuclear genes in DNA barcoding: a comparison with plastid genes in two Hawaiian plant radiations	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Adaptive radiation Island biogeography Lobeliads Next-generation sequencing Progression rule Single-copy nuclear genes	ADAPTIVE RADIATION LAND PLANTS PHYLOGENY EVOLUTION ISLANDS ORIGIN COLONIZATION SPECIATION ASTERACEAE GENUS	Background: DNA barcoding of land plants has relied traditionally on a small number of Marchkers from the plastid genome. In contrast, low-copy nuclear genes have received little attention as DNA barcodes because of the absence of universal primers for PCR amplification. Results: From pooled-species 454 transcriptome data we identified two variable intron-less nuclear loci for each of two species-rich genera of the Hawaiian flora: Clermontia (Campanulaceae) and Cyrtandra (Gesneriaceae) and compared their utility as DNA barcodes with that of plastid genes. We found that nuclear genes showed an overall greater variability, but also displayed a high level of heterozygosity, intraspecific variation, and retention of ancient alleles. Thus, nuclear genes displayed fewer species-diagnostic haplotypes compared to plastid genes and no interspecies gaps. Conclusions: The apparently greater coalescence times of nuclear genes are likely to limit their utility as barcodes, as only a small proportion of their alleles were fixed and unique to individual species. In both groups, species-diagnostic Marchkers from either genome were scarce on the youngest island a minimum age of ca. two million years may be needed for a species flock to be barcoded. For young plant groups, nuclear genes may not be a superior alternative to slowly evolving plastid genes.	June 22, 2013Parallel re-modeling of EF-1 alpha function: divergent EF-1 alpha genes co-occur with EFL genes in diverse distantly related eukaryotes	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Diatoms Differential Gene Loss EF-1 alpha EFL Functional Remodeling Goniomonas Pythium Spizellomyces Thecamonas	PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES GENOME PROTEINS RNA HAPTOPHYTES EVOLUTION SEQUENCES RHIZARIA TREE TU	Background: Elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) and elongation factor-like (EFL) proteins are functionally homologous to one another, and are core components of the eukaryotic translation machinery. The patchy distribution of the two elongation factor types across global eukaryotic phylogeny is suggestive of a 'differential loss' hypothesis that assumes that EF-1 alpha and EFL were present in the most recent common ancestor of eukaryotes followed by independent differential losses of one of the two factors in the descendant lineages. To date, however, just one diatom and one fungus have been found to have both EF-1 alpha and EFL (dual-EF-containing species). Results: In this study, we characterized 35 new EF-1 alpha/EFL sequences from phylogenetically diverse eukaryotes. In so doing we identified 11 previously unreported dual-EF-containing species from diverse eukaryote groups including the Stramenopiles, Apusomonadida, Goniomonadida, and Fungi. Phylogenetic analyses suggested vertical inheritance of both genes in each of the dual-EF lineages. In the dual-EF-containing species we identified, the EF-1 alpha genes appeared to be highly divergent in sequence and suppressed at the transcriptional level compared to the co-occurring EFL genes. Conclusions: According to the known EF-1 alpha/EFL distribution, the differential loss process should have occurred independently in diverse eukaryotic lineages, and more dual-EF-containing species remain unidentified. We predict that dual-EF-containing species retain the divergent EF-1 alpha homologues only for a sub-set of the original functions. As the dual-EF-containing species are distantly related to each other, we propose that independent re-modelling of EF-1 alpha function took place in multiple branches in the tree of eukaryotes.

The Pistosauroidea include rare Triassic forms (Pistosauridae) and the Plesiosauria of the Jurassic and Cretaceous. Long bones of Nothosaurus and Pistosaurus from the Muschelkalk (Middle Triassic) of Germany and France and a femur of the Lower Jurassic Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus were studied histologically and microanatomically to understand the evolution of locomotory adaptations, patterns of growth and life history in these two lineages. Results: We found that the cortex of adult Nothosaurus long bones consists of lamellar zonal bone. Large Upper Muschelkalk humeri of large-bodied Nothosaurus mirabilis and N. giganteus differ from the small Lower Muschelkalk (Nothosaurus Marchchicus/N. winterswijkensis) humeri by a striking microanatomical specialization for aquatic tetrapods: the medullary cavity is much enlarged and the cortex is reduced to a few millimeters in thickness. Unexpectedly, the humeri of Pistosaurus consist of continuously deposited, radially vascularized fibrolamellar bone tissue like in the Plesiosaurus sample. Plesiosaurus shows intense Haversian remodeling, which has never been described in Triassic sauropterygians. Conclusions: The generally lamellar zonal bone tissue of nothosaur long bones indicates a low growth rate and suggests a low basal metabolic rate. The large triangular cross section of large-bodied Nothosaurus from the Upper Muschelkalk with their large medullary region evolved to withstand high bending loads. Nothosaurus humerus morphology and microanatomy indicates the evolution of paraxial front limb propulsion in the Middle Triassic, well before its convergent evolution in the Plesiosauria in the latest Triassic. Fibrolamellar bone tissue, as found in Pistosaurus and Plesiosaurus, suggests a high growth rate and basal metabolic rate. The presence of fibrolamellar bone tissue in Pistosaurus suggests that these features had already evolved in the Pistosauroidea by the Middle Triassic, well before the plesiosaurs radiated. Together with a relatively large body size, a high basal metabolic rate probably was the key to the invasion of the Pistosauroidea of the pelagic habitat in the Middle Triassic and the success of the Plesiosauria in the Jurassic and Cretaceous.

It is difficult, therefore, to propose a mechanism to account for observed changes in mitogenome structure. Mitochondrial gene rearrangements are usually explained by the recombination model or tandem duplication and random loss model. Results: In this study, the complete mitochondrial genomes of four flatfishes, Crossorhombus azureus (blue flounder), Grammatobothus krempfi, Pleuronichthys cornutus, and Platichthys stellatus were determined. A striking finding is that eight genes in the C. azureus mitogenome are located in a Novemberel position, differing from that of available vertebrate mitogenomes. Specifically, the ND6 and seven tRNA genes (the Q, A, C, Y, S1, E, P genes) encoded by the L-strand have been translocated to a position between tRNA-T and tRNA-F though the original order of the genes is maintained. Conclusions: These special features are used to suggest a mechanism for C. azureus mitogenome rearrangement. First, a dimeric molecule was formed by two monomers linked head-to-tail, then one of the two sets of promoters lost function and the genes controlled by the disabled promoters became pseudogenes, non-coding sequences, and even were lost from the genome. This study provides a new gene-rearrangement model that accounts for the events of gene-rearrangement in a vertebrate mitogenome.

In G. minus, multiple pairs of genetically related, physically proximate cave and surface populations exist which exhibit a high degree of intraspecific morphological divergence. The morphology, ecology, and genetic structure of these sister populations are well characterized, yet the genetic basis of their morphological divergence remains unknown. Results: We used degenerate PCR primers designed to amplify opsin genes within the subphylum Crustacea and discovered two distinct opsin paralogs (average inter-paralog protein divergence approximate to 20%) in the genome of three independently derived pairs of G. minus cave and surface populations. Both opsin paralogs were found to be related to other crustacean middle wavelength sensitive opsins. Low levels of nucleotide sequence variation (< 1% within populations) were detected in both opsin genes, regardless of habitat, and dN/dS ratios did not indicate a relaxation of functional constraint in the cave populations with reduced or absent eyes. Maximum likelihood analyses using codon-based models also did not detect a relaxation of functional constraint in the cave lineages. We quantified expression level of both opsin genes and found that the expression of both paralogs was significantly reduced in all three cave populations relative to their sister surface populations. Conclusions: The concordantly lowered expression level of both opsin genes in cave populations of G. minus compared to sister surface populations, combined with evidence for persistent purifying selection in the cave populations, is consistent with an unspecified pleiotropic function of opsin proteins. Our results indicate that phototransduction proteins such as opsins may have retained their function in cave-adapted organisms because they may play a pleiotropic role in other important processes that are unrelated to vision.

Despite recent understanding that these genes play a role in establishing the architecture of inflorescences in the sunflower family (Asteraceae), where hundreds of finely organized flowers are arranged to mimic an individual flower, little is known about their function in the development of flower-like inflorescences across diverse phylogenetic groups. Here, we studied the head-like pseudanthium of the Australian swamp daisy Actinodium cunninghamii Schau. (Myrtaceae, the myrtle family), which consists of a cluster of fertile flowers surrounded by showy ray-shaped structures, to fully characterize its inflorescence development and to test whether CYC-like genes may participate in the control of its daisy-like flowering structures. Results: We used standard morphological and anatomical methods to analyze Actinodium inflorescence development. Furthermore, we isolated Actinodium CYC-like genes using degenerate PCR primers, and studied the expression patterns of these genes using quantitative RT-PCR. We found that the ray-shaped elements of Actinodium are not single flowers but instead branched short-shoots occasionally bearing flowers. We found differential expression of CYC-like genes across the pseudanthium of Actinodium, correlating with the showiness and branching pattern of the ray structures. Conclusions: The Actinodium inflorescence represents a Novemberel type of pseudanthium with proximal branches mimicking ray flowers. Expression patterns of CYC-like genes are suggestive of participation in the control of pseudanthium development, in a manner analogous to the distantly related Asteraceae. As such, flowering plants appear to have recruited CYC-like genes for heteromorphic inflorescence development at least twice during their evolutionary history.

This evolutionarily conserved protein is involved in the folding of a wide variety of other proteins in the cytosol, being essential to the cell. The folding activity proceeds through strong conformational changes mediated by the co-chaperonin GroES and ATP. Functions alternative to folding have been previously described for GroEL in different bacterial groups, supporting enormous functional and structural plasticity for this molecule and the existence of a hidden combinatorial code in the protein sequence enabling such functions. Describing this plasticity can shed light on the functional diversity of GroEL. We hypothesize that different overlapping sets of amino acids coevolve within GroEL, GroES and between both these proteins. Shifts in these coevolutionary relationships may inevitably lead to evolution of alternative functions. Results: We conducted the first coevolution analyses in an extensive bacterial phylogeny, revealing complex networks of evolutionary dependencies between residues in GroESL. These networks differed among bacterial groups and involved amino acid sites with functional importance and others with previously unsuspected functional potential. Coevolutionary networks formed statistically independent units among bacterial groups and map to structurally continuous regions in the protein, suggesting their functional link. Sites involved in coevolution fell within narrow structural regions, supporting dynamic combinatorial functional links involving similar protein domains. Moreover, coevolving sites within a bacterial group mapped to regions previously identified as involved in folding-unrelated functions, and thus, coevolution may mediate alternative functions. Conclusions: Our results highlight the evolutionary plasticity of GroEL across the entire bacterial phylogeny. Evidence on the functional importance of coevolving sites illuminates the as yet unappreciated functional diversity of proteins.

Cetaceans originated from terrestrial mammals and they have evolved a series of adaptations to aquatic environments, which are of evolutionary significance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their aquatic adaptations have not been well explored. This study provided insights into the evolution of hair loss during the transition from land to water by investigating and comparing two essential regulators of hair follicle development and hair follicle cycling, i.e., the Hairless (Hr) and FGF5 genes, in representative cetaceans and their terrestrial relatives. Results: The full open reading frame sequences of the Hr and FGF5 genes were characterized in seven cetaceans. The sequence characteristics and evolutionary analyses suggested the functional loss of the Hr gene in cetaceans, which supports the loss of hair during their full adaptation to aquatic habitats. By contrast, positive selection for the FGF5 gene was found in cetaceans where a series of positively selected amino acid residues were identified. Conclusions: This is the first study to investigate the molecular basis of the hair loss in cetaceans. Our investigation of Hr and FGF5, two indispensable regulators of the hair cycle, provide some new insights into the molecular basis of hair loss in cetaceans. The results suggest that positive selection for the FGF5 gene might have promoted the termination of hair growth and early entry into the catagen stage of hair follicle cycling. Consequently, the hair follicle cycle was disrupted and the hair was lost completely due to the loss of the Hr gene function in cetaceans. This suggests that cetaceans have evolved an effective and complex mechanism for hair loss.

In eukaryotes, four subfamilies can be distinguished according to their function and localisation in different cellular compartments: cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Generally, multiple cytosol-type Hsp70s can be found in metazoans that show either constitutive expression and/or stress-inducibility, arguing for the evolution of different tasks and functions. Information about the hsp70 copy number and diversity in microbial eukaryotes is, however, scarce, and detailed knowledge about the differential gene expression in most protists is lacking. Therefore, we have characterised the Hsp70 gene family of Paramecium caudatum to gain insight into the evolution and differential heat stress response of the distinct family members in protists and to investigate the diversification of eukaryotic hsp70s focusing on the evolution of heat-inducibility. Results: Eleven putative hsp70 genes could be detected in P. caudatum comprising homologs of three major Hsp70-subfamilies. Phylogenetic analyses revealed five evolutionarily distinct Hsp70-groups, each with a closer relationship to orthologous sequences of Paramecium tetraurelia than to another P. caudatum Hsp70-group. These highly diverse, paralogous groups resulted from duplications preceding Paramecium speciation, underwent divergent evolution and were subject to purifying selection. Heat-shock treatments were performed to test for differential expression patterns among the five Hsp70-groups as well as for a functional conservation within Paramecium. These treatments induced exceptionally high mRNA up-regulations in one cytosolic group with a low basal expression, indicative for the major heat inducible hsp70s. All other groups showed comparatively high basal expression levels and moderate heat-inducibility, signifying constitutively expressed genes. Comparative EST analyses for P. tetraurelia hsp70s unveiled a corresponding expression pattern, which supports a functionally conserved evolution of the Hsp70 gene family in Paramecium. Conclusions: Our analyses suggest an independent evolution of the heat-inducible cytosol-type hsp70s in Paramecium and in its close relative Tetrahymena, as well as within higher eukaryotes. This result indicates convergent evolution during hsp70 subfunctionalization and implies that heat-inducibility evolved several times during the course of eukaryotic evolution.

Species are characterized by extensively branched filaments produced when grown on agarized culture medium. Despite the large number of species described exclusively using light microscopic morphology, the assessment of species diversity is hampered by extensive morphological plasticity. Results: Two independent types of molecular data, the chloroplast-encoded psbA/rbcL spacer complemented by rbcL gene and the internal transcribed spacer 2 of the nuclear rDNA cistron (ITS2), congruently recovered a robust phylogenetic structure. With ITS2 considerable sequence and secondary structure divergence existed among the eight species, but a combined sequence and secondary structure phylogenetic analysis confined to helix II of ITS2 corroborated relationships as inferred from the rbcL gene phylogeny. Intra-genomic divergence of ITS2 sequences was revealed in many strains. The 'monophyletic species concept', appropriate for microalgae without known sexual reproduction, revealed eight different species. Species boundaries established using the molecular-based monophyletic species concept were more conservative than the traditional morphological species concept. Within a species, almost identical chloroplast Marchker sequences (genotypes) were repeatedly recovered from strains of different origins. At least two species had widespread geographical distributions however, within a given species, genotypes recovered from Antarctic strains were distinct from those in temperate habitats. Furthermore, the sequence diversity may correspond to adaptation to different types of habitats or climates. Conclusions: We established a method and a reference data base for the unambiguous identification of species of the common soil microalgal genus Heterococcus which uses DNA sequence variation in Marchkers from plastid and nuclear genomes. The molecular data were more reliable and more conservative than morphological data.

Recent studies have emphasized the importance of rapid diversification within hotspots, compared to non-hotspot regions, as a major contributor to these patterns. We constructed the first near-complete phylogeny of Banksia (Proteaceae) to test whether diversification rates have differed between lineages confined to the southwest Australian hotspot and those found throughout southern, eastern and northern Australia. We then tested for variation in diversification rates among the bioclimatic zones within the southwest hotspot itself. Results: Although Banksia species richness in the southwest is ten times that of the rest of the continent, we find little evidence for more rapid diversification in the southwest, although this result is inconclusive. However, we find firmer support for substantial rate variation within the southwest hotspot, with more rapid diversification in the semi-arid heaths and shrublands, compared to the high-rainfall forests. Most of the Banksia diversity of the southwest appears to be generated in the heaths and shrublands, with a high migration rate out of this zone boosting diversity of the adjacent forest zone. Conclusions: The geographic pattern of diversification in Banksia appears more complex than can be characterized by a simple hotspot vs. non-hotspot comparison, but in general, these findings contrast with the view that the high diversity of Mediterranean hotspots is underpinned by rapid radiations. Steady accumulation of species at unexceptional rates, but over long periods of time, may also have contributed substantially to the great botanical richness of these regions.

These genes display clustered organization and colinear expression. Expression boundaries of individual Hox genes usually correspond with morphological boundaries of the body. Previously, we studied Hox gene expression during larval development of the polychaete Alitta virens (formerly Nereis virens) and discovered that Hox genes are expressed in nereid larva according to the spatial colinearity principle. Adult Alitta virens consist of multiple morphologically similar segments, which are formed sequentially in the growth zone. Since the worm grows for most of its life, postlarval segments constantly change their position along the anterior-posterior axis. Results: We studied the expression dynamics of the Hox cluster during postlarval development of the nereid Alitta virens and found that 8 out of 11 Hox genes are transcribed as wide gene-specific gradients in the ventral nerve cord, ectoderm, and mesoderm. The expression domains constantly shift in accordance with the changing proportions of the growing worm, so expression domains of most Hox genes do not have stable anterior or/and posterior boundaries. In the course of our study, we revealed long antisense RNA (asRNA) for some Hox genes. Expression patterns of two of these genes were analyzed using whole-mount in-situ hybridization. This is the first discovery of antisense RNA for Hox genes in Lophotrochozoa. Conclusion: Hox gene expression in juvenile A. virens differs significantly from Hox gene expression patterns both in A. virens larva and in other Bilateria. We suppose that the postlarval function of the Hox genes in this polychaete is to establish and maintain positional coordinates in a constantly growing body, as opposed to creating morphological difference between segments.	June 22, 2013Expression of Hox genes during regeneration of nereid polychaete Alitta (Nereis) virens (Annelida, Lophotrochozoa)	EVODEVO	Regeneration ncRNA Hox genes Positional information Polychaetes Lophotrochozoa	AMPHIBIAN LIMB REGENERATION HOMEOBOX GENES PLATYNEREIS-DUMERILII NONCODING RNAS STEM-CELLS TRANSCRIPTION EVOLUTION LARVAL GROWTH MODEL	Background: Hox genes are the key determinants of different morphogenetic events in all bilaterian animals. These genes are probably responsible for the maintenance of regenerative capacities by providing positional information in the regenerating animal body. Polychaetes are well known for their ability to regenerate the posterior as well as the anterior part of the body. We have recently described the expression of 10 out of 11 Hox genes during postlarval growth of Alitta (Nereis) virens. Hox genes form gradient overlapping expression patterns, which probably do not contribute to the morphological diversity of segments along the anterior-posterior axis of the homonomously segmented worm. We suggest that this gradient expression of Hox genes establishes positional information along the body that can be used to maintain coordinated growth and regeneration. Results: We showed that most of the Hox gene expression patterns are reorganized in the central nervous system, segmental ectoderm and mesoderm. The reorganization takes place long before regeneration becomes apparent. The most rapid reorganization was observed for the genes with the largest differences in expression levels in the amputation site and the terminal structures (pygidium and growth zone). Moreover, we revealed the expression of two antisense Hox RNAs (Nvi-antiHox5 and Nvi-antiHox7) demonstrating unique expression patterns during regeneration. Conclusions: Hox genes probably participate in the maintenance and restoration of the positional information in A. virens. During postlarval growth and regeneration, Hox genes do not alter the diversity of segments but provide the positional information along the anterior-posterior axis. The reorganization of at least some Hox gene patterns during regeneration may be regulated by their anti-sense transcripts, providing a rapid response of Hox gene transcripts to positional failure. The capacity of Hox genes to maintain the positional information in the adult body is present in different bilaterian animals (planarias, polychaetes and mammals) and might be an ancestral function inherited from the common evolutionary remote ancestor.

In arthropods (insects, crustaceans, myriapods and chelicerates), Hox genes function to specify segmental identity, and changes in Hox gene expression domains in different segments have been causal to the evolution of Novemberel arthropod morphologies. Despite this, the roles of Hox genes in arthropods that have secondarily lost or reduced their segmental composition have been relatively unexplored. Recent data suggest that acariform mites have a reduced segmental component of their posterior body tagma, the opisthosoma, in that only two segments are patterned during embryogenesis. This is in contrast to the observation that in many extinct and extant chelicerates (that is, horseshoe crabs, scorpions, spiders and harvestmen) the opisthosoma is comprised of ten or more segments. To explore the role of Hox genes in this reduced body region, we followed the expression of the posterior-patterning Hox genes Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and Abdominal-B (Abd-B), as well as the segment polarity genes patched (ptc) and engrailed (en), in the oribatid mite Archegozetes longisetosus. Results: We find that the expression patterns of ptc are in agreement with previous reports of a reduced mite opisthosoma. In comparison to the ptc and en expression patterns, we find that Ubx and Abd-B are expressed in a single segment in A. longisetosus, the second opisthosomal segment. Abd-B is initially expressed more posteriorly than Ubx, that is, into the unsegmented telson however, this domain clears in subsequent stages where it remains in the second opisthosomal segment. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that Ubx and Abd-B are expressed in a single segment in the opisthosoma. This is a Novemberel observation, in that these genes are expressed in several segments in all studied arthropods. These data imply that a reduction in opisthosomal segmentation may be tied to a dramatically reduced Hox gene input in the opisthosoma.

These results provided strong evidence to support a preformation mechanism for primordial germ cell (PGC) development in B. floridae. Results: In this study, we further characterize the expression of B. floridae homologs of Piwi and Tudor, which play important roles in germline development in diverse metazoan animals. We show that maternal mRNA of one of the identified Piwi-like homologs, Bf-Piwil1, also colocalizes with Vasa in the vegetal germ plasm and has zygotic expression in both the putative PGCs and the tail bud, suggesting it may function in both germline and somatic stem cells. More interestingly, one Tudor family gene, Bf-Tdrd7, is only expressed maternally and colocalizes with Vasa in germ plasm, suggesting that it may function exclusively in germ cell specification. To evaluate the conservation of the preformation mechanism among amphioxus species, we further analyze Vasa, Nanos, Piwil1, and Tdrd7 expression in two Asian amphioxus species, B. belcheri and B. japonicum. Their maternal transcripts all localize in similar patterns to those seen in B. floridae. In addition, we labeled putative PGCs with Vasa antibody to trace their dynamic distribution in developing larvae. Conclusions: We identify additional germ plasm components in amphioxus and demonstrate the molecular distinction between the putative germline stem cells and somatic stem cells. Moreover, our results suggest that preformation may be a conserved mechanism for PGC specification among Branchiostoma species. Our Vasa antibody staining results suggest that after the late neurula stage, amphioxus PGCs probably proliferate with the tail bud cells during posterior elongation and are deposited near the forming myomere boundaries. Subsequently, these PGCs would concentrate at the ventral tip of the myoSeptembertal walls to form the gonad anlagen.

Previous studies have shown that sensory systems such as the lateral line (mechanosensory) and taste buds (chemosensory) are modified in cavefish. It has long been hypothesized that another chemosensory modality, the olfactory system, might have evolved as well to provide an additional mechanism for food-searching in troglomorphic Astyanax populations. Findings: During a Marchch 2013 cave expedition to the Sierra de El Abra region of San Luis Potosi, Mexico, we tested chemosensory capabilities of the Astyanax mexicanus of the Rio Subterraneo cave. This cave hosts a hybrid population presenting a wide range of troglomorphic and epigean mixed phenotypes. During a behavioral test performed in situ in the cave, a striking correlation was observed between the absence of eyes and an increased attraction to food extract. In addition, eyeless troglomorphic fish possessed significantly larger naris size than their eyed, nontroglomorphic counterparts. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that chemosensory capabilities might have evolved in cave-dwelling Astyanax mexicanus and that modulation of naris size might at least partially underlie this likely adaptive change.

As a member of the phylum Arthropoda, the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei has to adapt to the complex water environments with various symbiotic or parasitic microorganisms, which provide a platform for horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Results: In this study, we analyzed the genome-wide HGT events in L. vannamei. Through homology search and phylogenetic analysis, followed by experimental PCR confirmation, 14 genes with HGT event were identified: 12 of them were transferred from bacteria and two from fungi. Structure analysis of these genes showed that the introns of the two fungi-originated genes were substituted by shrimp DNA fragment, two genes transferred from bacteria had shrimp specific introns inserted in them. Furthermore, around other three bacteria-originated genes, there were three large DNA segments inserted into the shrimp genome. One segment was a transposon that fully transferred, and the other two segments contained only coding regions of bacteria. Functional prediction of these 14 genes showed that 6 of them might be related to energy metabolism, and 4 others related to defense of the organism. Conclusions: HGT events from bacteria or fungi were happened in the genome of L. vannamei, and these horizontally transferred genes can be transcribed in shrimp. This is the first time to report the existence of horizontally transferred genes in shrimp. Importantly, most of these genes are exposed to a negative selection pressure and appeared to be functional.

However, intron content is highly variable among species. The tempo of intron gains and losses has been irregular and several factors may explain why some genomes are intron-poor whereas other are intron-rich. Results: We studied the dynamics of intron gains and losses in an alpha-amylase gene, whose product breaks down starch and other polysaccharides. It was transferred from an Actinobacterium to an ancestor of Agaricomycotina. This gene underwent further duplications in several species. The results indicate a high rate of intron insertions soon after the gene settled in the fungal genome. A number of these oldest introns, regularly scattered along the gene, remained conserved. Subsequent gains and losses were lineage dependent, with a majority of losses. Moreover, a few species exhibited a high number of both specific intron gains and losses in recent periods. There was little sequence conservation around insertion sites, then probably little information for splicing, whereas splicing sites, inside introns, showed typical and conserved patterns. There was little variation of intron size. Conclusions: Since most Basidiomycetes have intron-rich genomes and this richness was ancestral in Fungi, long before the transfer event, we suggest that the new gene was shaped to comply with requirements of the splicing machinery, such as short exon and intron sizes, in order to be correctly processed.

In most eubacteria, isoprenoids are synthesized through the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. The production of MEP is usually catalyzed by deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR-I) but a few organisms use an alternative DXR-like enzyme (DXR-II). Results: Searches through 1498 bacterial complete proteomes detected 130 sequences with similarity to DXR-II. Phylogenetic analysis identified three well-resolved clades: the DXR-II family (clustering 53 sequences including eleven experimentally verified as functional enzymes able to produce MEP), and two previously uncharacterized NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductase families (designated DLO1 and DLO2 for DXR-II-like oxidoreductases 1 and 2). Our analyses identified amino acid changes critical for the acquisition of DXR-II biochemical function through type-I functional divergence, two of them mapping onto key residues for DXR-II activity. DXR-II showed a Marchkedly discontinuous distribution, which was verified at several levels: taxonomic (being predominantly found in AlphApriloteobacteria and Firmicutes), metabolic (being mostly found in bacteria with complete functional MEP pathways with or without DXR-I), and phenotypic (as no biological/phenotypic property was found to be preferentially distributed among DXR-II-containing strains, apart from pathogenicity in animals). By performing a thorough comparative sequence analysis of GC content, 3: 1 dinucleotide frequencies, codon usage and codon adaptation indexes (CAI) between DXR-II sequences and their corresponding genomes, we examined the role of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), as opposed to an scenario of massive gene loss, in the evolutionary origin and diversification of the DXR-II subfamily in bacteria. Conclusions: Our analyses support a single origin of the DXR-II family through functional divergence, in which constitutes an exceptional model of acquisition and maintenance of redundant gene functions between nonhomologous genes as a result of convergent evolution. Subsequently, although old episodic events of HGT could not be excluded, the results supported a prevalent role of gene loss in explaining the distribution of DXR-II in specific pathogenic eubacteria. Our results highlight the importance of the functional characterization of evolutionary shortcuts in isoprenoid biosynthesis for screening specific antibacterial drugs and for regulating the production of isoprenoids of human interest.

Members of the extended light-harvesting complex (LHC) protein superfamily are involved in light harvesting as well as in photoprotection and are found in the red and green plant lineages, with a complex distribution pattern of subfamilies in the different algal lineages. Results: Here, we demonstrate that the recently discovered red lineage chlorophyll a/b-binding-like proteins (RedCAPs) form a monophyletic family within this protein superfamily. The occurrence of RedCAPs was found to be restricted to the red algal lineage, including red algae (with priMarchy plastids) as well as cryptophytes, haptophytes and heterokontophytes (with secondary plastids of red algal origin). Expression of a full-length RedCAP:GFP fusion construct in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum confirmed the predicted plastid localisation of RedCAPs. Furthermore, we observed that similarly to the fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding light-harvesting antenna proteins also RedCAP transcripts in diatoms were regulated in a diurnal way at standard light conditions and strongly repressed at high light intensities. Conclusions: The absence of RedCAPs from the green lineage implies that RedCAPs evolved in the red lineage after Septemberaration from the the green lineage. During the evolution of secondary plastids, RedCAP genes therefore must have been transferred from the nucleus of the endocytobiotic alga to the nucleus of the host cell, a process that involved complementation with pre-sequences allowing import of the gene product into the secondary plastid bound by four membranes. Based on light-dependent transcription and on localisation data, we propose that RedCAPs might participate in the light (intensity and quality)-dependent structural or functional reorganisation of the light-harvesting antennae of the photosystems upon dark to light shifts as regularly experienced by diatoms in nature. ReMarchkably, in plastids of the red lineage as well as in green lineage plastids, the phycobilisome based cyanobacterial light harvesting system has been replaced by light harvesting systems that are based on members of the extended LHC protein superfamily, either for one of the photosystems (PS I of red algae) or for both (diatoms). In their proposed function, the RedCAP protein family may thus have played a role in the evolutionary structural remodelling of light-harvesting antennae in the red lineage.

A single transcription factor, Spalt (Sal), has been previously associated with the development of some pattern elements in Pieris rapae, but it is unclear to what extent Sal is associated with patterns in other pierid species. Results: We use immunohistochemistry targeting Sal proteins across several pierids and show that Sal is associated with dense patches of melanization across species but is not associated with vein-melanization or diffuse melanization on the wing. In addition, Sal is expressed along cross-veins and wing compartment midlines that do not develop melanization. Male and female P. rapae spots are sexually dimorphic in size and this dimorphism is also present in the domains of Sal expression. Finally, by disrupting cells positioned in the center of the anterior black spots of P. rapae, before and during the time of Sal expression, spot size was reduced. Conclusions: Our results suggest, but do not conclusively show, that pierid spots may develop in a manner similar to that of nymphalid eyespots, that is, containing a group of signaling cells at the center of the pattern responsible for the differentiation of the complete spot, and that spots and eyespots share at least one signal-response gene in common, the transcription factor Sal. We propose that focal differentiation and focal signaling mechanisms evolved prior to the split of the nymphalid and pierid lineages.

Previous studies with Drosophila melanogaster show that male's ability to clear bacteria Decemberreases with increase in sexual activity. We subjected this idea to test using two pathogens (Pseudomonas entomophila and Staphylococcus succinus) and three different populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Results: We found that sexual activity enhanced male survivorship in a pathogen specific manner. Sexually active males show higher resistance than virgins upon infection with Pseudomonas entomophila. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of sexual activity increased with time of co-habitation with females and Decemberlined when access to females was restricted. We observed no change in male survivorship upon experimentally varying the number of sexual interactions. Conclusion: Our results show that the sexual activity-immunity trade-off in males cannot be generalised. The trade-off is potentially mediated through complex interactions between the host, pathogen and the environment experienced by the host.

While at the cellular level the modular organization of molecular interactions has been analyzed in detail, the phenotypic modularity (or variational modularity) of cell shape remains unexplored. The mammalian spermatozoon constitutes one of the most complex and specialized cell types found in organisms. The structural heterogeneity found in the sperm head suggests an association between its inner composition, shape and specificity of function. However, little is known about the extent of the connections between these features. Taking advantage of the house mouse sperm morphology, we analyzed the variational modularity of the sperm head by testing several hypotheses related to its structural and functional organization. Because chromosomal rearrangements can affect the genotype-phenotype map of individuals and thus modify the patterns of covariation between traits, we also evaluate the effect of Robertsonian translocations on the modularity pattern of the sperm head. Results: The results indicated that the house mouse sperm head is divided into three variational modules (the acrosomal, post-acrosomal and ventral spur module), which correspond to the main regions of the cytoskeletal mesh beneath the plasma membrane, i.e., the perinuclear theca. Most of the covariation is concentrated between the ventral spur and the acrosomal and post-acrosomal modules. Although the Rb fusions did not alter the main modularity pattern, they did affect the percentages of covariation between pairs of modules. Conclusions: The structural heterogeneity of the cytoskeleton is responsible for the modular organization of the sperm head shape, corroborating the role that this structure has in maintaining the cell shape. The reduction in percentages of shape covariation between pairs of modules in Rb sperms suggests that chromosomal rearrangements could induce changes in the genotype-phenotype map. Nevertheless, how these variations affect sperm fertilization success is yet to be elucidated.

However, molecular age estimates using only one or a few (often misapplied) fossil calibration points have produced a diversity of conflicting ages for important evolutionary events within this clade. I here identify 16 fossil calibration points of relevance to the phylogeny of Bovidae and Ruminantia and use these, individually and together, to construct a dated molecular phylogeny through a reanalysis of the full mitochondrial genome of over 100 ruminant species. Results: The new multi-calibrated tree provides ages that are younger overall than found in previous studies. Among these are young ages for the origin of crown Ruminantia (39.3-28.8 Ma), and crown Bovidae (17.3-15.1 Ma). These are argued to be reasonable hypotheses given that many basal fossils assigned to these taxa may in fact lie on the stem groups leading to the crown clades, thus inflating previous age estimates. Areas of conflict between molecular and fossil dates do persist, however, especially with regard to the base of the rapid Pecoran radiation and the sister relationship of Moschidae to Bovidae. Results of the single-calibrated analyses also show that a very wide range of molecular age estimates are obtainable using different calibration points, and that the choice of calibration point can influence the topology of the resulting tree. Compared to the single-calibrated trees, the multi-calibrated tree exhibits smaller variance in estimated ages and better reflects the fossil record. Conclusions: The use of a large number of vetted fossil calibration points with soft bounds is promoted as a better approach than using just one or a few calibrations, or relying on internal-congruency metrics to discard good fossil data. This study also highlights the importance of considering morphological and ecological characteristics of clades when delimiting higher taxa. I also illustrate how phylogeographic and paleoenvironmental hypotheses inferred from a tree containing only extant taxa can be problematic without consideration of the fossil record. Incorporating the fossil record of Ruminantia is a necessary step for future analyses aiming to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this clade.

A Novemberel structure may open up an array of possibilities for adaptation, and thus is fundamental to the evolution of complex multicellular life. We use the respiratory appendages on the dorsal-anterior side of the Drosophila eggshell as a model system for morphological Novemberelty. To study the co-option of genetic pathways in the evolution of this Novemberelty we have compared oogenesis and eggshell patterning in Drosophila melanogaster with Ceratitis capitata, a dipteran whose eggs do not bear dorsal appendages. Results: During the final stages of oogenesis, the appendages are formed by specific groups of cells in the follicular epithelium of the egg chamber. These cells are defined via signaling activity of the Dpp and EGFr pathways, and we find that both pathways are active in C. capitata oogenesis. The transcription factor gene mirror is expressed downstream of EGFr activation in a dorsolateral domain in the D. melanogaster egg chamber, but could not be detected during C. capitata oogenesis. In D. melanogaster, Mirror regulates the expression of two important genes: broad, which defines the appendage primordia, and pipe, involved in embryonic dorsoventral polarity. In C. capitata, broad remains expressed ubiquitously throughout the follicular epithelium, and is not restricted to the appendage primordia. Interestingly pipe expression did not differ between the two species. Conclusions: Our analysis identifies both broad and mirror as important nodes that have been redeployed in the Drosophila egg chamber patterning network in the evolution of a morphologically Novemberel feature. Further, our results show how pre-existing signals can provide an epithelium with a spatial coordinate system, which can be co-opted for Novemberel patterns.

The evolution of exon-intron structure remains mysterious despite rapid advance in genome sequencing technique. In this work, a Novemberel approach is taken based on the assumptions that the evolution of exon-intron structure is a stochastic process, and that the characteristics of this process can be understood by examining its historical outcome, the present-day size distribution of internal translated exons (exon). Through the combination of simulation and modeling the size distribution of exons in different species, we propose a general random fragmentation process (GRFP) to characterize the evolution dynamics of exon-intron structure. This model accurately predicts the probability that an exon will be split by a new intron and the distribution of Novemberel insertions along the length of the exon. Results: As the first observation from this model, we show that the chance for an exon to obtain an intron is proportional to its size to the 3rd power. We also show that such size dependence is nearly constant across gene, with the exception of the exons adjacent to the 5' UTR. As the second conclusion from the model, we show that intron insertion loci follow a normal distribution with a mean of 0.5 (center of the exon) and a standard deviation of 0.11. Finally, we show that intron insertions within a gene are independent of each other for vertebrates, but are more negatively correlated for non-vertebrate. We use simulation to demonstrate that the negative correlation might result from significant intron loss during evolution, which could be explained by selection against multi-intron genes in these organisms. Conclusions: The GRFP model suggests that intron gain is dynamic with a higher chance for longer exons introns are inserted into exons randomly with the highest probability at the center of the exon. GRFP estimates that there are 78 introns in every 10 kb coding sequences for vertebrate genomes, agreeing with empirical observations. GRFP also estimates that there are significant intron losses in the evolution of non-vertebrate genomes, with extreme cases of around 57% intron loss in Drosophila melanogaster, 28% in Caenorhabditis elegans, and 24% in Oryza sativa.

We investigated the role of specificity, relative virulence and relative dose in determining the competitive outcome of multiple infections in the Daphnia magna-Pasteuria ramosa host-parasite system. Results: We found that infections by P. ramosa clones (single genotype) were less virulent and produced more spores than infections by P. ramosa isolates (possibly containing multiple genotypes). We also found that two similarly virulent isolates of P. ramosa differed considerably in their within-host competitiveness and their effects on host offspring production when faced with coinfecting P. ramosa isolates and clones. Although the relative virulence of a P. ramosa isolate/clone appears to be a good indicator of its competitiveness during multiple infections, the relative dose may alter the competitive outcome. Moreover, spore counts on day 20 post-infection indicate that the competitive outcome is largely Decemberided early in the parasite's growth phase, possibly mediated by direct interference or apparent competition. Conclusions: Our results emphasize the importance of epidemiology as well as of various parasite traits in determining the outcome of within-host competition. Incorporating realistic epidemiological and ecological conditions when testing theoretical models of multiple infections, as well as using a wider range of host and parasite genotypes, will enable us to better understand the course of virulence evolution.

In this study we explore how niche construction can lead to viruses engineering their hosts (including behavioural manipulation) with feedback on selective pressures for viral transmission and virulence. To illustrate this concept we focus on Baculoviridae, a family of invertebrate viruses that have evolved to modify the feeding behaviour of their lepidopteran hosts and liquefy their cadavers as part of the course of infection. Results: We present a mathematical model showing how niche construction leads to feedback from the behavioural manipulation to the liquefaction of the host, linking the evolution of both of these traits, and show how this association arises from the action of niche construction. Model results show that niche construction is plausible in this system and delineates the conditions under which niche construction will occur. Niche construction in this system is also shown to be sensitive to parameter values that reflect ecological forces. Conclusions: Our model demonstrates that niche construction can be a potent force in viral evolution and can lead to the acquisition and maintenance of the behavioural manipulation and liquefaction traits in Baculoviridae via the niche constructing effects on the host. These results show the potential for niche construction theory to provide new insights into viral evolution.

A striking example of pattern mimicry is found in the pattern diversity of moth and butterfly wings, which is thought to evolve from preexisting elements illustrated by the nymphalid ground plan (NGP). Previous studies demonstrated that individuality of the NGP facilitates the Decemberoupling of associated common elements, leading to divergence. In contrast, recent studies on the concept of modularity have argued the importance of a combination of coupling and Decemberoupling of the constituent elements. Here, we examine the modularity of a mimicry wing pattern in a moth and explore an evolvable characteristic of the NGP. Results: This study examined the wings of the nOctoberuid moth Oraesia excavata, which closely resemble leaves with a leaf venation pattern. Based on a comparative morphological procedure, we found that this leaf pattern was formed by the NGP common elements. Using geometric morphometrics combined with network analysis, we found that each of the modules in the leaf pattern integrates the constituent components of the leaf venation pattern (i.e., the main and lateral veins). Moreover, the detected modules were established by coupling different common elements and Decemberoupling even a single element into different modules. The modules of the O. excavata wing pattern were associated with leaf mimicry, not with the individuality of the NGP common elements. For comparison, we also investigated the modularity of a nonmimetic pattern in the nOctoberuid moth Thyas Juneo. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that the modules of the T. Juneo wing pattern regularly corresponded to the individuality of the NGP common elements, unlike those in the O. excavata wing pattern. Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence for modularity in a leaf mimicry pattern. The results suggest that the evolution of this pattern involves coupling and Decemberoupling processes to originate these modules, free from the individuality of the NGP system. We propose that this evolution has been facilitated by a versatile characteristic of the NGP, allowing the association of freely modifiable subordinate common elements to make modules.

While many fish groups exhibit this general pattern, other clades demonstrate minimal, and in some cases contrasting, associations between diet and intestinal length. Moreover, this relationship and its evolutionary derivation have received little attention from a phylogenetic perspective. This study documents the phylogenetic development of intestinal length variability, and resultant correlation with dietary habits, within a molecular phylogeny of 28 species of terapontid fishes. The Terapontidae (grunters), an ancestrally euryhaline-Marchine group, is the most trophically diverse of Australia's freshwater fish families, with widespread shifts away from animal-prey-dominated diets occurring since their invasion of fresh waters. Results: Description of ontogenetic development of intestinal complexity of terapontid fishes, in combination with ancestral character state reconstruction, demonstrated that complex intestinal looping (convolution) has evolved independently on multiple occasions within the family. This modification of ontogenetic development drives much of the associated interspecific variability in intestinal length evident in terapontids. Phylogenetically informed comparative analyses (phylogenetic independent contrasts) showed that the interspecific differences in intestinal length resulting from these ontogenetic developmental mechanisms explained similar to 65% of the variability in the proportion of animal material in terapontid diets. Conclusions: The ontogenetic development of intestinal complexity appears to represent an important functional inNovemberation underlying the extensive trophic differentiation seen in Australia's freshwater terapontids, specifically facilitating the pronounced shifts away from carnivorous (including invertebrates and vertebrates) diets evident across the family. The capacity to modify intestinal morphology and physiology may also be an important facilitator of trophic diversification during other phyletic radiations.

Several physiological mechanisms have been suggested to maintain the water and salt balance in cetaceans, but their genetic and evolutionary bases remain poorly explored. The current study investigated the genes involved in osmoregulation in cetaceans and compared them with their counterparts in terrestrial mammals to test whether adaptive evolution occurred during secondary aquatic adaptation. Results: The present study analyzed the molecular evolution of 11 osmoregulation-related genes in 11 cetacean species, which represented all of the major cetacean clades. The results demonstrated positive selection acting on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensinogen (AGT), SLC14A2, and aquaporin 2 (AQP2). This evidence for the positive selection of AQP2 and SLC14A2 suggests that the adaptive evolution of these genes has helped to enhance the capacity for water and urea transport, thereby leading to the concentration of urine, which is an efficient mechanism for maintaining the water balance. By contrast, a series of positively selected amino acid residues identified in the ACE and AGT (two key members of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, RAAS) proteins of cetaceans suggests that RAAS might have been adapted to maintain the water and salt balance in response to a hyperosmotic environment. Radical amino acid changes in positively selected sites were distributed among most internal and terminal branches of the cetacean phylogeny, which suggests the pervasively adaptive evolution of osmoregulation since the origin of cetaceans and their subsequent diversification. Conclusions: This is the first comprehensive analysis of the molecular evolution of osmoregulation-related genes in cetaceans in response to selection pressure from a generally hyperosmotic environment. Four genes, i.e., AQP2, SLC14A2, ACE, and AGT were subject to positive selection in cetaceans, which suggests that cetaceans may have adapted to maintain their water and salt balance. This also suggests that cetaceans may have evolved an effective and complex mechanism for osmoregulation.

Similar to Hox clusters, chordate ParaHox genes including Gsx, Xlox, and Cdx, are clustered and their expression exhibits temporal and spatial colinearity. In non-chordate animals, however, studies on the genomic organization of ParaHox genes are limited to only a few animal taxa. Hemichordates, such as the Enteropneust acorn worms, have been used to gain insights into the origins of chordate characters. In this study, we investigated the genomic organization and expression of ParaHox genes in the indirect developing hemichordate acorn worm Ptychodera flava. Results: We found that P. flava contains an intact ParaHox cluster with a similar arrangement to that of chordates. The temporal expression order of the P. flava ParaHox genes is the same as that of the chordate ParaHox genes. During embryogenesis, the spatial expression pattern of PfCdx in the posterior endoderm represents a conserved feature similar to the expression of its orthologs in other animals. On the other hand, PfXlox and PfGsx show a Novemberel expression pattern in the blastopore. Nevertheless, during metamorphosis, PfXlox and PfCdx are expressed in the endoderm in a spatially staggered pattern similar to the situation in chordates. Conclusions: Our study shows that P. flava ParaHox genes, despite forming an intact cluster, exhibit temporal colinearity but lose spatial colinearity during embryogenesis. During metamorphosis, partial spatial colinearity is retained in the transforming larva. These results strongly suggest that intact ParaHox gene clustering was retained in the deuterostome ancestor and is correlated with temporal colinearity.

As a result of their direct plant-plant connections with their host plant, parasitic plants have special opportunities for horizontal gene transfer, the nonsexual transmission of genetic material across species boundaries. There is increasing evidence that parasitic plants have served as recipients and donors of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), but the long-term impacts of eukaryotic HGT in parasitic plants are largely unknown. Results: Here we show that a gene encoding albumin 1 KNOTTIN-like protein, closely related to the albumin 1 genes only known from papilionoid legumes, where they serve dual roles as food storage and insect toxin, was found in Phelipanche aegyptiaca and related parasitic species of family Orobanchaceae, and was likely acquired by a Phelipanche ancestor via HGT from a legume host based on phylogenetic analyses. The KNOTTINs are well known for their unique disulfide through disulfide knot structure and have been extensively studied in various contexts, including drug design. Genomic sequences from nine related parasite species were obtained, and 3D protein structure simulation tests and evolutionary constraint analyses were performed. The parasite gene we identified here retains the intron structure, six highly conserved cysteine residues necessary to form a KNOTTIN protein, and displays levels of purifying selection like those seen in legumes. The albumin 1 xenogene has evolved through > 150 speciation events over ca. 16 million years, forming a small family of differentially expressed genes that may confer Novemberel functions in the parasites. Moreover, further data show that a distantly related parasitic plant, Cuscuta, obtained two copies of albumin 1 KNOTTIN-like genes from legumes through a Septemberarate HGT event, suggesting that legume KNOTTIN structures have been repeatedly co-opted by parasitic plants. Conclusions: The HGT-derived albumins in Phelipanche represent a Novemberel example of how plants can acquire genes from other plants via HGT that then go on to duplicate, evolve, and retain the specialized features required to perform a unique host-derived function.

Detecting PAIs/GEIs as well as their putative source can provide insight into the organism's pathogenicity within its host. Previously we introduced a tool called S-plot which provides a visual representation of the variation in compositional properties across and between genomic sequences. Utilizing S-plot and new functionality developed here, we examined 18 publicly available Neisseria genomes, including strains of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic species, in order to identify regions of unusual compositional properties (RUCPs) using both a sliding window as well as a gene-by-gene approach. Results: Numerous GEIs and PAIs were identified including virulence genes previously found within the pathogenic Neisseria species. While some genes were conserved amongst all species, only pathogenic species, or an individual species, a number of genes were detected that are unique to an individual strain. While the majority of such genes have an origin unknown, a number of putative sources including pathogenic and capsule-containing bacteria were determined, indicative of gene exchange between Neisseria spp. and other bacteria within their microhabitat. Furthermore, we uncovered evidence that both N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae have Septemberarately acquired DNA from their human host. Data suggests that all three Neisseria species have received horizontally transferred elements post-speciation. Conclusions: Using this approach, we were able to not only find previously identified regions of virulence but also new regions which may be contributing to the virulence of the species. This comparative analysis provides a means for tracing the evolutionary history of the acquisition of foreign DNA within this genus. Looking specifically at the RUCPs present within the 18 genomes considered, a stronger similarity between N. meningitidis and N. lactamica is observed, suggesting that N. meningitidis arose before N. gonorrhoeae.

ENVIRONMENTAL-STRESS GENOME EVOLUTION EST-SSR ISRAEL POPULATIONS DICOCCOIDES POLYMORPHISM RESOURCES DOMESTICATION	Background: Patterns of genetic diversity between and within natural plant populations and their driving forces are of great interest in evolutionary biology. However, few studies have been performed on the genetic structure and population divergence in wild emmer wheat using a large number of EST-related single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Marchkers. Results: In the present study, twenty-five natural wild emmer wheat populations representing a wide range of ecological conditions in Israel and Turkey were used. Genetic diversity and genetic structure were investigated using over 1,000 SNP Marchkers. A moderate level of genetic diversity was detected due to the biallelic property of SNP Marchkers. Clustering based on Bayesian model showed that grouping pattern is related to the geographical distribution of the wild emmer wheat. However, genetic differentiation between populations was not necessarily dependent on the geographical distances. A total of 33 outlier loci under positive selection were identified using a FST-outlier method. Significant correlations between loci and ecogeographical factors were observed. Conclusions: Natural selection appears to play a major role in generating adaptive structures in wild emmer wheat. SNP Marchkers are appropriate for detecting selectively-channeled adaptive genetic diversity in natural populations of wild emmer wheat. This adaptive genetic diversity is significantly associated with ecological factors.

To defend against insects, for example, damaged plants emit volatile organic compounds that attract the herbivore's natural enemies. So far, plant volatile responses have been studied extensively in conJunection with leaf chewing and sap sucking insects, yet little is known about the relationship between plant volatiles and gall-inducers, the most sophisticated herbivores. Here we describe a new role for volatiles as gall-insects were found to benefit from this plant defence. Results: Chemical analyses of galls triggered by the gregarious aphid Slavum wertheimae on wild pistachio trees showed that these structures contained and emitted considerably higher quantities of plant terpenes than neighbouring leaves and fruits. Behavioural assays using goats as a generalist herbivore confirmed that the accumulated terpenes acted as olfactory signals and feeding deterrents, thus enabling the gall-inducers to escape from inadvertent predation by mammals. Conclusions: Increased emission of plant volatiles in response to insect activity is commonly looked upon as a cry for help by the plant to attract the insect's natural enemies. In contrast, we show that such volatiles can serve as a first line of insect defences that extends the 'extended phenotype' represented by galls, beyond physical boundaries. Our data support the Enemy hypothesis insofar that high levels of gall secondary metabolites confer protection against natural enemies.

These interactions have the potential to act as barriers to gene flow between species, and may be important in the process of speciation. There are multiple post-mating barriers to interbreeding between the hybridising field crickets Gryllus bimaculatus and G. campestris. Female G. bimaculatus preferentially store sperm from conspecific males when mated to both conspecific and heterospecific partners. Additionally, conspecific males sire an even greater proportion of offspring than would be predicted from their sperm's representation in the spermatheca. The nature of these post-sperm-storage barriers to hybridisation are unknown. We use a fluorescent staining technique to determine whether barriers occur prior to, or during embryo development. Results: We show that eggs laid by G. bimaculatus females mated to G. campestris males are less likely to begin embryogenesis than eggs from conspecific mating pairs. Of the eggs that are successfully fertilised and start to develop, those from heterospecific mating pairs are more likely to arrest early, prior to blastoderm formation. We find evidence for bimodal variation among egg clutches in the number of developing embryos that subsequently arrest, indicating that there is genetic variation for incompatibility between mating individuals. In contrast to the pattern of early embryonic mortality, those hybrids reaching advanced stages of embryogenesis have survival rates equal to that of embryos from conspecific mating pairs. Conclusions: Post-sperm-storage barriers to hybridisation show evidence of genetic polymorphism. They are sufficiently large, that if the species interbreed where they are sympatric, these barriers could play a role in the maintenance of reproductive isolation between them. The number of eggs that fail to develop represents a substantial cost of hybridization to G. bimaculatus females, and this cost could reinforce the evolution of barriers occurring earlier in the reproductive process.

These changes were shown to be intimately linked to environmental space-flight related constraints. Results: Here, we use an array of different techniques for ground-based simulation of microgravity effects to assess the effect of suboptimal environmental conditions on the gene expression of Drosophila in reduced gravity. A global and integrative analysis, using gene expression dynamics inspector (GEDI) self-organizing maps, reveals different degrees in the responses of the transcriptome when using different environmental conditions or microgravity/hypergravity simulation devices. Although the genes that are affected are different in each simulation technique, we find that the same gene ontology groups, including at least one large multigene family related with behavior, stress response or organogenesis, are over represented in each case. Conclusions: These results suggest that the transcriptome as a whole can be finely tuned to gravity force. In optimum environmental conditions, the alteration of gravity has only mild effects on gene expression but when environmental conditions are far from optimal, the gene expression must be tuned greatly and effects become more robust, probably linked to the lack of experience of organisms exposed to evolutionary Novemberel environments such as a gravitational free one.

The emergence of Novemberel domains is related to protein functional diversification and adaptation. But currently little is known about how Novemberel domains arise and how they subsequently evolve. Results: To gain insights into the impact of recently emerged domains in protein evolution we have identified all human young protein domains that have emerged in approximately the past 550 million years. We have classified them into vertebrate-specific and mammalian-specific groups, and compared them to older domains. We have found 426 different annotated young domains, totalling 995 domain occurrences, which represent about 12.3% of all human domains. We have observed that 61.3% of them arose in newly formed genes, while the remaining 38.7% are found combined with older domains, and have very likely emerged in the context of a previously existing protein. Young domains are preferentially located at the N-terminus of the protein, indicating that, at least in vertebrates, Novemberel functional sequences often emerge there. Furthermore, young domains show significantly higher non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates than older domains using human and mouse orthologous sequence comparisons. This is also true when we compare young and old domains located in the same protein, suggesting that recently arisen domains tend to evolve in a less constrained manner than older domains. Conclusions: We conclude that proteins tend to gain domains over time, becoming progressively longer. We show that many proteins are made of domains of different age, and that the fastest evolving parts correspond to the domains that have been acquired more recently.	June 22, 2013Delayed colonisation of Acacia by thrips and the timing of host-conservatism and behavioural specialisation	BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY		PLANT-FEEDING INSECTS AUSTRALIAN GALL-THRIPS ECOLOGICAL SPECIALIZATION ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE SAWFLIES HYMENOPTERA BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY PHYTOPHAGOUS INSECTS MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD TRADE-OFFS EVOLUTION	Background: Repeated colonisation of Novemberel host-plants is believed to be an essential component of the evolutionary success of phytophagous insects. The relative timing between the origin of an insect lineage and the plant clade they eat or reproduce on is important for understanding how host-range expansion can lead to resource specialisation and speciation. Path and stepping-stone sampling are used in a Bayesian approach to test divergence timing between the origin of Acacia and colonisation by thrips. The evolution of host-plant conservatism and ecological specialisation is discussed. Results: Results indicated very strong support for a model describing the origin of the common ancestor of Acacia thrips subsequent to that of Acacia. A current estimate puts the origin of Acacia at approximately 6 million years before the common ancestor of Acacia thrips, and 15 million years before the origin of a gall-inducing clade. The evolution of host conservatism and resource specialisation resulted in a phylogenetically under-dispersed pattern of host-use by several thrips lineages. Conclusions: Thrips colonised a diversity of Acacia species over a protracted period as Australia experienced aridification. Host conservatism evolved on phenotypically and environmentally suitable host lineages. Ecological specialisation resulted from habitat selection and selection on thrips behavior that promoted priMarchy and secondary host associations. These findings suggest that delayed and repeated colonisation is characterised by cycles of oligo-or poly-phagy. This results in a cumulation of lineages that each evolve host conservatism on different and potentially transient host-related traits, and facilitates both ecological and resource specialisation.

RNRs are also amongst the most abundant genes identified in environmental metagenomes. This study focused on understanding the distribution, diversity, and evolution of RNRs in phages (viruses that infect bacteria). Hidden Marchkov Model profiles were used to analyze the proteins encoded by 685 completely sequenced double-stranded DNA phages and 22 environmental viral metagenomes to identify RNR homologs in cultured phages and uncultured viral communities, respectively. Results: RNRs were identified in 128 phage genomes, nearly tripling the number of phages known to encode RNRs. Class I RNR was the most common RNR class observed in phages (70%), followed by class II (29%) and class III (28%). Twenty-eight percent of the phages contained genes belonging to multiple RNR classes. RNR class distribution varied according to phage type, isolation environment, and the host's ability to utilize oxygen. The majority of the phages containing RNRs are Myoviridae (65%), followed by Siphoviridae (30%) and Podoviridae (3%). The phylogeny and genomic organization of phage and host RNRs reveal several distinct evolutionary scenarios involving horizontal gene transfer, co-evolution, and differential selection pressure. Several putative split RNR genes interrupted by self-splicing introns or inteins were identified, providing further evidence for the role of frequent genetic exchange. Finally, viral metagenomic data indicate that RNRs are prevalent and highly dynamic in uncultured viral communities, necessitating future research to determine the environmental conditions under which RNRs provide a selective advantage. Conclusions: This comprehensive study describes the distribution, diversity, and evolution of RNRs in phage genomes and environmental viral metagenomes. The distinct distributions of specific RNR classes amongst phages, combined with the various evolutionary scenarios predicted from RNR phylogenies suggest multiple inheritance sources and different selective forces for RNRs in phages. This study significantly improves our understanding of phage RNRs, providing insight into the diversity and evolution of this important auxiliary metabolic gene as well as the evolution of phages in response to their bacterial hosts and environments.

Indicator models, in contrast, predict that sexually selected traits indicate mate condition. We investigate the potential for sensory exploitation and condition indication models to explain the evolution of what appears to be a recently evolved sexually selected trait. Question: Did red pelvic spine coloration in male Turnbull National Wildlife Refuge (TNWR) brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans) evolve to exploit a pre-existing sensory bias for red prey, thus helping males draw females to the nest? Or, did it evolve as an intersexual signal indicating male condition to females? Methods: We recorded the frequency of red pelvic spine coloration in males versus females and in breeding versus non-breeding males. We measured the condition factor of males with and without red coloration on their pelvic spines. We presented fish with a paired choice between a red versus an orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple bead, and recorded the proportion of bites at each colour. Results: Red coloration was significantly more common in males than in females and in males during the breeding season than outside the breeding season. Males with strongly red pelvic spines have a significantly higher mean condition factor than those with plain spines. TNWR brook stickleback prefer red to other colours in a predation context. Conclusions: Our results suggest that TNWR brook stickleback red pelvic spine coloration is a secondary sexual character that may exploit a pre-existing sensory bias for red prey while also indicating condition to females.

Instead, sex is widespread and clonal species face early obsolescence. One possible reason is that sex is an adaptation that allows organisms to respond more effectively to endless changes in their environment. The purpose of this study was to model mutation and selection in a diploid organism in an evolving environment and ascertain their support for sex. Results: We used a computational approach to model finite populations where a haploid environment subjects a diploid host to endlessly evolving change. Evolution in both populations is priMarchily through adoption of Novemberel advantageous mutations within a large allele space. Sex outcompetes cloning by two complementary mechanisms. First, sexual diploids adopt advantageous homozygous mutations more rapidly than clonal ones under conditions of lag load (the gap between the actual adaptation of the diploid population and its theoretical optimum). This rate advantage can offset the higher fecundity of cloning. Second, a relative advantage to sex emerges where populations are significantly polymorphic, because clonal polymorphism runs the risk of clonal interference caused by selection on numerous lines of similar adaptation. This interference extends allele lifetime and reduces the rate of adaptation. Sex abolishes the interference, making selection faster and elevating population fitness. Differences in adaptation between sexual and clonal populations increase Marchkedly with the number of loci under selection, the rate of mutation in the host, and a rapidly evolving environment. Clonal interference in these circumstances leads to conditions where the greater fecundity of clones is unable to offset their poor adaptation. Sexual and clonal populations then either co-exist, or sex emerges as the more stable evolutionary strategy. Conclusions: Sex can out-compete clones in a rapidly evolving environment, such as that characterized by pathogens, where clonal interference reduces the adaptation of clonal populations and clones adopt advantageous mutations more slowly. Since all organisms carry parasitic loads, the model is of potentially general applicability.

The sexual system androdioecy - where males and hermaphrodites coexist in populations - is extremely rare, yet is found in three crustacean groups, barnacles, a genus of clam shrimps Eulimnadia, and in the order Notostraca, the tadpole shrimps. In the ancient crustacean order Notostraca, high morphological conservatism contrasts with a wide diversity of sexual systems, including androdioecy. An understanding of the evolution of sexual systems in this group has been hampered by poor phylogenetic resolution and confounded by the widespread occurrence of cryptic species. Here we use a multigene supermatrix for 30 taxa to produce a comprehensive phylogenetic reconstruction of Notostraca. Based on this phylogenetic reconstruction we use character mapping techniques to investigate the evolution of sexual systems. We also tested the hypothesis that reproductive assurance has driven the evolution of androdioecy in Notostraca. Results: Character mapping analysis showed that sexual system is an extremely flexible trait within Notostraca, with repeated shifts between gonochorism and androdioecy, the latter having evolved a minimum of five times. In agreement with the reproductive assurance hypothesis androdioecious notostracans are found at significantly higher latitudes than gonochoric ones indicating that post glacial re-colonisation may have selected for the higher colonisation ability conferred by androdioecy. Conclusions: In contrast to their conserved morphology, sexual system in Notostraca is highly labile and the rare reproductive mode androdioecy has evolved repeatedly within the order. Furthermore, we conclude that this lability of sexual system has been maintained for at least 250 million years and may have contributed to the long term evolutionary persistence of Notostraca. Our results further our understanding of the evolution of androdioecy and indicate that reproductive assurance is a recurrent theme involved in the evolution of this sexual system.

Celebrating successes and identifying new questions, the Seventh International Conference on Stickleback Behaviour and Evolution was held 29 Julyy to 3 Augustust 2012 near Seattle, Washington, USA. Questions: How has research on stickleback shaped our understanding of phenotypic variation, genomic variation, speciation, and eco-evolutionary dynamics? How is future research on stickleback likely to advance these topics? Phenotypic variation: Stickleback show exceptional variation at a diversity of spatial scales, which has yielded insights not only into how natural selection shapes evolutionary diversification, but also how the influence of natural selection can be constrained. Future research would profit from examining temporal variation in selection and the multifarious nature of selection. Genomic variation: Stickleback adapted to different environments show widespread, but heterogeneous, genomic differentiation that is often associated with variation in recombination rate and that shows both parallel and non-parallel patterns. Profitable areas for future research include identifying the links between genotype-phenotype-fitness, the processes generating genomic patterns of differentiation, the mechanisms underlying variation in recombination, and the spread of chromosomal inversions. Speciation: Stickleback research has shaped our understanding of ecological speciation, the factors that promote and constrain it, and the traits involved in reproductive isolation. More work is needed in all these areas, as well as in the genomics of speciation and the alternatives to ecological speciation. Eco-evolutionary dynamics: Stickleback adapted to different environments have differential effects on community and ecosystem variables in mesocosms. Future work should investigate the strength and form of these effects in nature, the importance of plastic and genetic contributions, and the nature of feedbacks between ecology and evolution.

Although the differing isolating mechanisms of vicariance and rapidly evolving gamete recognition proteins have been proposed, a stable and robust phylogeny is unavailable. Results: We used a phylogenomic approach with mitochondrial and nuclear genes taking advantage of the whole-genome sequencing of nine species in the group to establish a stable (i.e. concordance in tree topology among multiple lies of evidence) and robust (i.e. high nodal support) phylogenetic hypothesis for the family Strongylocentrotidae. We generated eight draft mitochondrial genome assemblies and obtained 13 complete mitochondrial genes for each species. Consistent with previous studies, mitochondrial sequences failed to provide a reliable phylogeny. In contrast, we obtained a very well-supported phylogeny from 2301 nuclear genes without evidence of positive Darwinian selection both from the majority of most-likely gene trees and the concatenated fourfold degenerate sites: ((P. depressus, (M. nudus, M. franciscanus), (H. pulcherrimus, (S. purpuratus, (S. fragilis, (S. pallidus, (S. droebachiensis, S. intermedius)). This phylogeny was consistent with a single invasion of deep-water environments followed by a holarctic expansion by Strongylocentrotus. Divergence times for each species estimated with reference to the divergence times between the two major clades of the group suggest a correspondence in the timing with the opening of the Bering Strait and the invasion of the holarctic regions. Conclusions: Nuclear genome data contains phylogenetic signal informative for understanding the evolutionary history of this group. However, mitochondrial genome data does not. Vicariance can explain major patterns observed in the phylogeny. Other isolating mechanisms are appropriate to explore in this system to help explain divergence patterns not well supported by vicariance, such as the effects of rapidly evolving gamete recognition proteins on isolating populations. Our findings of a stable and robust phylogeny, with the increase in mitochondrial and nuclear comparative genomic data, provide a system in which we can enhance our understanding of molecular evolution and adaptation in this group of sea urchins.

Salamanders of the genus Eurycea in central Texas provide a particularly challenging example with respect to phylogeny reconstruction, biogeography and taxonomy. These predominantly aquatic species inhabit karst limestone aquifers and spring outflows, and exhibit a wide range of morphological and genetic variation. We extensively sampled spring and cave populations of six Eurycea species within this group (eastern Blepsimolge clade), to reconstruct their phylogenetic and biogeographic history using mtDNA and examine patterns and origins of cave- and surface-associated morphological variation. Results: Genetic divergence is generally low, and many populations share ancestral haplotypes and/or show evidence of introgression. This pattern likely indicates a recent radiation coupled with a complex history of intermittent connections within the aquatic karst system. Cave populations that exhibit the most extreme troglobitic morphologies show no or very low divergence from surface populations and are geographically interspersed among them, suggesting multiple instances of rapid, parallel phenotypic evolution. Morphological variation is diffuse among cave populations this is in contrast to surface populations, which form a tight cluster in morphospace. Unexpectedly, our analyses reveal two distinct and previously unrecognized morphological groups encompassing multiple species that are not correlated with spring or cave habitat, phylogeny or geography, and may be due to developmental plasticity. Conclusions: The evolutionary history of this group of spring- and cave-dwelling salamanders reflects patterns of intermittent isolation and gene flow influenced by complex hydrogeologic dynamics that are characteristic of karst regions. Shallow genetic divergences among several species, evidence of genetic exchange, and nested relationships across morphologically disparate cave and spring forms suggests that cave invasion was recent and many troglobitic morphologies arose independently. These patterns are consistent with an adaptive-shift hypothesis of divergence, which has been proposed to explain diversification in other karst fauna. While cave and surface forms often do not appear to be genetically isolated, morphological diversity within and among populations may be maintained by developmental plasticity, selection, or a combination thereof.

The nature of divergences between co-occurring sympatric species, factors contributing to reproductive isolation and modes of genome evolution is a much debated topic in evolutionary biology addressed by various experimental tools. To the best of our knowledge, nobody approached this field using molecular cytogenetics. We examined chromosomes and genomes of one postglacial species pair, sympatric European winter-spawning Coregonus albula and the local endemic dwarf-sized spring-spawning C. fontanae, both originating in Lake Stechlin. We have employed molecular cytogenetic tools to identify the genomic differences between the two species of the sympatric pair on the sub-chromosomal level of resolution. Results: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments consistently revealed a distinct variation in the copy number of loci of the major ribosomal DNA (the 45S unit) between C. albula and C. fontanae genomes. In C. fontanae, up to 40 chromosomes were identified to bear a part of the major ribosomal DNA, while in C. albula only 8-10 chromosomes possessed these genes. To determine mechanisms how such extensive genome alternation might have arisen, a PCR screening for retrotransposons from genomic DNA of both species was performed. The amplified retrotransposon Rex1 was used as a probe for FISH mapping onto chromosomes of both species. These experiments showed a clear co-localization of the ribosomal DNA and the retrotransposon Rex1 in a pericentromeric region of one or two acrocentric chromosomes in both species. Conclusion: We demonstrated genomic consequences of a rapid ecological speciation on the level undetectable by neither sequence nor karyotype analysis. We provide indirect evidence that ribosomal DNA probably utilized the spreading mechanism of retrotransposons subsequently affecting recombination rates in both genomes, thus, leading to a rapid genome divergence. We attribute these extensive genome re-arrangements associated with speciation event to stress-induced retrotransposons (re) activation. Such causal interplay between genome differentiation, retrotransposons (re) activation and environmental conditions may become a topic to be explored in a broader genomic context in future evolutionary studies.

However, accumulating recent evidence has demonstrated that silent mutations may destabilize RNA structures or disrupt cis regulatory motifs superimposed on coding sequences. Such observations suggest the existence of stretches of codon sites that are evolutionary conserved at both DNA-RNA and protein levels. Such stretches may point to functionally important regions within protein coding sequences not necessarily reflecting functional constraints on the amino-acid sequence. The HIV-1 genome is highly compact, and often harbors overlapping functional elements at the protein, RNA, and DNA levels. This superimposition of functions leads to complex selective forces acting on all levels of the genome and proteome. Considering the constraints on HIV-1 to maintain such a highly compact genome, we hypothesized that stretches of synonymous conservation would be common within its genome. Results: We used a combined computational-experimental approach to detect and characterize regions exhibiting strong purifying selection against synonymous substitutions along the HIV-1 genome. Our methodology is based on advanced probabilistic evolutionary models that explicitly account for synonymous rate variation among sites and rate dependencies among adjacent sites. These models are combined with a randomization procedure to automatically identify the most statistically significant regions of conserved synonymous sites along the genome. Using this procedure we identified 21 conserved regions. Twelve of these are mapped to regions within overlapping genes, seven correlate with known functional elements, while the functions of the remaining four are yet unknown. Among these four regions, we chose the one that deviates most from synonymous rate homogeneity for in-depth computational and experimental characterization. In our assays aiming to quantify viral fitness in both early and late stages of the replication cycle, no differences were observed between the mutated and the wild type virus following the introduction of synonymous mutations. Conclusions: The contradiction between the inferred purifying selective forces and the lack of effect of these mutations on viral replication may be explained by the fact that the phenotype was measured in single-cycle infection assays in cell culture. Such a system does not account for the complexity of HIV-1 infections in vivo, which involves multiple infection cycles and interaction with the host immune system.

We studied the humeral microanatomy of eleven extant and eight extinct talpid taxa of different lifestyles and of two non-fossorial outgroups and examined the effects of size and phylogeny. We tested the hypothesis that bone microanatomy is different in highly derived humeri of fossorial taxa than in terrestrial and semi-aquatic ones, likely due to special mechanical strains to which they are exposed to during digging. This study is the first comprehensive examination of histological parameters in an ecologically diverse and small-sized mammalian clade. Results: No pattern of global bone compactness was found in the humeri of talpids that could be related to biomechanical specialization, phylogeny or size. The transition zone from the medullary cavity to the cortical compacta was larger and the ellipse ratio smaller in fossorial talpids than in non-fossorial talpids. No differences were detected between the two distantly related fossorial clades, Talpini and Scalopini. Conclusions: At this small size, the overall morphology of the humerus plays a predominant role in absorbing the load, and microanatomical features such as an increase in bone compactness are less important, perhaps due to insufficient gravitational effects. The ellipse ratio of bone compactness shows relatively high intraspecific variation, and therefore predictions from this ratio based on single specimens are invalid.

The accumulated repetitive sequences include multigene families, microsatellites, satellite DNAs and mobile elements, all of which are important for the structural remodeling of heterochromatin. In grasshoppers, derived sex chromosome systems, such as neo-XY male/XX female and neo-X1X2Y male/X1X1X2X2 female, are frequently observed in the Melanoplinae subfamily. However, no studies concerning the evolution of sex chromosomes in Melanoplinae have addressed the role of the repetitive DNA sequences. To further investigate the evolution of sex chromosomes in grasshoppers, we used classical cytogenetic and FISH analyses to examine the repetitive DNA sequences in six phylogenetically related Melanoplinae species with X0 male/XX female, neo-XY male/XX female and neo-X1X2Y male/X1X1X2X2 female sex chromosome systems. Results: Our data indicate a non-spreading of heterochromatic blocks and pool of repetitive DNAs (C(0)t-1 DNA) in the sex chromosomes however, the spreading of multigene families among the neo-sex chromosomes of Eurotettix and Dichromatos was reMarchkable, particularly for 5S rDNA. In autosomes, FISH mapping of multigene families revealed distinct patterns of chromosomal organization at the intra- and intergenomic levels. Conclusions: These results suggest a common origin and subsequent differential accumulation of repetitive DNAs in the sex chromosomes of Dichromatos and an independent origin of the sex chromosomes of the neo-XY and neo-X1X2Y systems. Our data indicate a possible role for repetitive DNAs in the diversification of sex chromosome systems in grasshoppers.

The ability to control sophisticated gene expression patterns enabled these ancient organisms to evolve several differentiated forms, invade multiple hosts and evade host immunity. How these abilities were acquired remains an outstanding question in protistan biology. Results: In this work, we study SET domain bearing genes that are implicated in mediating immune evasion, invasion and cytoadhesion pathways of modern apicomplexans, including malaria parasites. We provide the first conclusive evidence of a horizontal gene transfer of a Histone H4 Lysine 20 (H4K20) modifier, Set8, from an animal host to the ancestor of apicomplexans. Set8 is known to contribute to the coordinated expression of genes involved in immune evasion in modern apicomplexans. We also show the likely transfer of a H3K36 methyltransferase (Ashr3 from plants), possibly derived from algal endosymbionts. These transfers appear to date to the transition from free-living organisms to parasitism and coincide with the proposed horizontal acquisition of cytoadhesion domains, the O-glycosyltransferase that modifies these domains, and the priMarchy family of transcription factors found in apicomplexan parasites. Notably, phylogenetic support for these conclusions is robust and the genes clearly are dissimilar to SET sequences found in the closely related parasite Perkinsus Marchinus, and in ciliates, the nearest free-living organisms with complete genome sequences available. Conclusions: Animal and plant sources of epigenetic machinery provide new insights into the evolution of parasitism in apicomplexans. Along with the horizontal transfer of cytoadhesive domains, O-linked glycosylation and key transcription factors, the acquisition of SET domain methyltransferases Marchks a key transitional event in the evolution to parasitism in this important protozoan lineage.

The necessary spatial constraints might have been supplied by mineral surfaces initially, preceding the more effective compartmentalization in membrane vesicles which must have been a later development of chemical evolution. Results: Using our surface-bound RNA world model - the Metabolic Replicator Model (MRM) platform - we show that the mobilities on the mineral substrate surface of both the macromolecular replicators and the small molecules of metabolites they produce catalytically are the key factors determining the stable persistence of an evolvable metabolic replicator community. Conclusion: The effects of replicator mobility and metabolite diffusion on different aspects of replicator coexistence in MRM are determined, including the maximum attainable size of the metabolic replicator system and its resistance to the invasion of parasitic replicators. We suggest a chemically plausible hypothetical scenario for the evolution of the first protocell starting from the surface-bound MRM system.

Immunity is encoded in an array of spacer sequences. Each spacer can provide specific immunity to invasive elements that carry the same or a similar sequence. Even in closely related strains, spacer content is very dynamic and evolves quickly. Standardmodels of nucleotide evolution cannot be applied to quantify its rate of change since processes other than single nucleotide changes determine its evolution. Methods: We present probabilistic models that are specific for spacer content evolution. They account for the different processes of insertion and deletion. Insertions can be constrained to occur on one end only or are allowed to occur throughout the array. One deletion event can affect one spacer or a whole fragment of adjacent spacers. Parameters of the underlying models are estimated for a pair of arrays by maximum likelihood using explicit ancestor enumeration. Results: Simulations show that parameters are well estimated on average under the models presented here. There is a bias in the rate estimation when including fragment deletions. The models also estimate times between pairs of strains. But with increasing time, spacer overlap goes to zero, and thus there is an upper bound on the distance that can be estimated. Spacer content similarities are displayed in a distance based phylogeny using the estimated times. We use the presented models to analyze different Yersinia pestis data sets and find that the results among them are largely congruent. The models also capture the variation in diversity of spacers among the data sets. A comparison of spacer-based phylogenies and Cas gene phylogenies shows that they resolve very different time scales for this data set. Conclusions: The simulations and data analyses show that the presented models are useful for quantifying spacer content evolution and for displaying spacer content similarities of closely related strains in a phylogeny. This allows for comparisons of different CRISPR arrays or for comparisons between CRISPR arrays and nucleotide substitution rates.

Here we investigated the evolutionary history of Nesticella cave spiders, which are mainly distributed in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, China. With comprehensive sampling and phylogenetic and coalescent-based analyses, we investigated the tempo and mode of diversification and the origins of these troglobites. We also aimed to determine which factors have influenced the diversification of this little-known group. Results: Coalescent-based species delimitation validated the 18 species recognized by morphological inspection and also suggested the existence of cryptic lineages. Divergence time estimates suggested that Nesticella cave spiders in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau constituted a monophyletic troglobite clade that originated in the middle Miocene (11.1-18.6 Ma). Although the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau clade was composed exclusively of troglobite species, suggesting an ancient common subterranean ancestor, we favor multiple, independent cave colonizations during the Pleistocene over a single ancient cave colonization event to explain the origin of these cave faunas. The diversification of plateau Nesticella has been greatly influenced by the sequential uplift of the plateau and likely reflects multiple cave colonizations over time by epigean ancestors during Pleistocene glacial advances. Conclusions: We concluded that plateau cave Nesticella represent an ancient group of spiders, but with young troglobite lineages that invaded caves only recently. The absence of extant epigean relatives and nearly complete isolation among caves supported their relict status. Our work highlights the importance of comprehensive sampling for studies of subterranean diversity and the evolution of cave organisms. The existence of potentially cryptic species and the relict status of Nesticella highlight the need to conserve these cave spiders.

BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Adaptation Akodon mollis Geometric morphometrics Skull shape Tropical mountains	PEROMYSCUS-MANICULATUS MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATION NATURAL-POPULATIONS MOUNTAIN PASSES MANDIBLE SHAPE EVOLUTION RODENTIA ANDES PATTERNS SKULL	Background: The extent of phenotypic differentiation in response to local environmental conditions is a key component of species adaptation and persistence. Understanding the structuring of phenotypic diversity in response to local environmental pressures can provide important insights into species evolutionary dynamics and responses to environmental change. This work examines the influence of steep environmental gradients on intraspecific phenotypic variation and tests two hypotheses about how the tropical soft grass mouse, Akodon mollis (Cricetidae, Rodentia), contends with the disparate environmental conditions encompassed by its broad distribution. Specifically, we test if the species expresses a geographically unstructured, or generalist, phenotype throughout its range or if it shows geographically localized morphological differentiation across disparate environments. Results: Using geometric morphometric and ecomorphological analyses of skull shape variation we found that despite distinct environmental conditions, geographically structured morphological variation is limited, with the notable exception of a distinct morphological disJunection at the high-elevation forest-grassland transition in the southern portion of A. mollis distribution. Based on genetic analyses, geographic isolation alone does not explain this localized phenotype, given that similar levels of genetic differentiation were also observed among individuals inhabiting other ecosystems that are nonetheless not distinct morphologically. Conclusions: Instead of phenotypic specialization across environments in these tropical mountains, there was limited differentiation of skull shape and size across the broad range of A. mollis, with the exception of individuals from the puna, the highest-elevation ecosystem. The high morphological variance among individuals, together with a weak association with local environmental conditions, not only highlights the flexibility of A. mollis' skull, but also highlights the need for further study to understand what maintains the observed morphological patterns. The work also indicates that mechanisms other than processes linked to local ecological specialization as a driver of diversification may contribute to the high diversity of this tropical region.

It was recently proposed that sperm whale predation is the main driver of eye size evolution in giant squid, on the basis of an optical model that suggested optimal performance in detecting large luminous visual targets such as whales in the deep sea. However, it is poorly understood how the eye size of giant and colossal squid compares to that of other aquatic organisms when scaling effects are considered. Results: We performed a large-scale comparative study that included 87 squid species and 237 species of acanthomorph fish. While squid have larger eyes than most acanthomorphs, a comparison of relative eye size among squid suggests that giant and colossal squid do not have unusually large eyes. After revising constants used in a previous model we found that large eyes perform equally well in detecting point targets and large luminous targets in the deep sea. Conclusions: The eyes of giant and colossal squid do not appear exceptionally large when allometric effects are considered. It is probable that the giant eyes of giant squid result from a phylogenetically conserved developmental pattern manifested in very large animals. Whatever the cause of large eyes, they appear to have several advantages for vision in the reduced light of the deep mesopelagic zone.

Following the Red Queen (RQ) assumption, asexual organisms are, due to their low genetic diversity, targets for parasite adaptation. Because MHC polymorphism is maintained by selection from parasites and sexual selection, MHC genes are considered as a suitable candidate for testing the RQ hypothesis. In this study, we investigated MHC variability and the selection pressure acting on MHC genes in sexual diploids and asexual triploids. In addition, we tested whether the asexual form of gibel carp suffers from higher parasite loads than the sexual form. Results: At the population level, genotype and allelic diversity of MHC were reduced in gynogenetic triploids when compared to sexual diploids. Different patterns in positively selected sites (PSS) between gynogens and sexual gibel carp were also found. A weak difference in parasite species richness was found between sexual fish and gynogens. However, two common clones of gynogens were significantly more parasitized than sexual diploids or other gynogens with rare MHC genotypes. At the individual level, the higher number of alleles was not associated with higher parasitism in either sexual diploids or gynogens. Conclusions: The differences in MHC diversity between gynogenetic triploids and sexual diploids are in accordance with the hypothesis of sexually-mediated selection increasing MHC diversity and fulfil a prerequisite of the Red Queen hypothesis. The different patterns in PSS between gynogens and sexual gibel carp also suggest the potential role of sexual selection and supports parasite-mediated selection maintaining MHC diversity. We showed that the most common MHC genotypes of gynogenetic triploids are the target of parasite selection. Our results suggest that the MHC genotype in gibel carp is more important than allelic number for immunocompetence.

In the Neotropics, few phylogeographic studies have focused on coastal species outside of the Atlantic Rainforest. Climatic and sea level changes during the Quaternary played an important role in the evolutionary history of many organisms found in coastal regions. To contribute to a better understanding of plant evolution in this environment in Southern South America, we focused on Calibrachoa heterophylla (Solanaceae), an endemic and vulnerable wild petunia species from the South Atlantic Coastal Plain (SACP). Results: We assessed DNA sequences from two cpDNA intergenic spacers and analyzed them using a phylogeographic approach. The present phylogeographic study reveals the influence of complex geologic and climatic events on patterns of genetic diversification. The results indicate that C. heterophylla originated inland and subsequently colonized the SACP the data show that the inland haplogroup is more ancient than the coastal one and that the inland was not affected by sea level changes in the Quaternary. The major diversification of C. heterophylla that occurred after 0.4 Myr was linked to sea level oscillations in the Quaternary, and any diversification that occurred before this time was obscured by Marchine transgressions that occurred before the coastal sand barrier's formation. Results of the Bayesian skyline plot showed a recent population expansion detected in C. heterophylla seems to be related to an increase in temperature and humidity that occurred at the beginning of the Holocene. Conclusions: The geographic clades have been formed when the coastal plain was deeply dissected by paleochannels and these correlate very well with the distributional limits of the clades. The four major sea transgressions formed a series of four sand barriers parallel to the coast that progressively increased the availability of coastal areas after the regressions and that may have promoted the geographic structuring of genetic diversity observed today. The recent population expansion for the entire species may be linked with the event of Marchine regression after the most recent sea transgression at similar to 5 kya.

Identifying the constraints imposed by past adaptations is, however, of importance for understanding many questions in evolutionary biology, such as the evolution of host usage dynamics by multi-host viruses or the emergence of escape mutants that persist in the absence of antiviral treatments. To address this issue, we undertook an experimental approach in which sixty lineages of Tobacco etch potyvirus that differ in their past evolutionary history and degree of adaptation to Nicotiana tabacum were allowed to adapt to this host for 15 rounds of within host multiplication and transfer. We thereafter evaluated the degree of adaptation to the new host as well as to the original ones and characterized the consensus sequence of each lineage. Results: We found that past evolutionary history did not determine the phenotypic outcome of this common host evolution phase, and that the signal of local adaptation to past hosts had largely disappeared. By contrast, evolutionary history left footprints at the genotypic level, since the majority of host-specific mutations present at the beginning of this experiment were retained in the end-point populations and may have affected which new mutations were consequently fixed. This resulted in further divergence between the sequences despite a shared selective environment. Conclusions: The present experiment reinforces the idea that the answer to the question How important is historical contingency in evolution? strongly depends on the level of integration of the traits studied. A strong historical contingency was found for TEV genotype, whereas a weak effect of on phenotypic evolution was revealed. In an applied context, our results imply that viruses are not easily trapped into suboptimal phenotypes and that (re) emergence is not evolutionarily constrained.

To date, 2500 extant species have been described but phylogenetic relationships at high taxonomic levels remain unresolved. Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary history-phylogeny, divergence times, character evolution and diversification-of this speciose clade. For this purpose, we sequenced two mitochondrial (16S and 12S) and three nuclear (H3, 18S and 28S) Marchkers for 19 of the 20 extant families, using traditional Sanger and next-generation 454 sequencing methods. Molecular data were combined with 156 morphological characters in order to estimate the largest anomuran phylogeny to date. The anomuran fossil record allowed us to incorporate 31 fossils for divergence time analyses. Results: Our best phylogenetic hypothesis (morphological + molecular data) supports most anomuran superfamilies and families as monophyletic. However, three families and eleven genera are recovered as para-and polyphyletic. Divergence time analysis dates the origin of Anomura to the Late Permian similar to 259 (224-296) MYA with many of the present day families radiating during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. Ancestral state reconstruction suggests that carcinization occurred independently 3 times within the group. The invasion of freshwater and terrestrial environments both occurred between the Late Cretaceous and Tertiary. Diversification analyses found the speciation rate to be low across Anomura, and we identify 2 major changes in the tempo of diversification the most significant at the base of a clade that includes the squat-lobster family Chirostylidae. Conclusions: Our findings are compared against current classifications and previous hypotheses of anomuran relationships. Many families and genera appear to be poly-or paraphyletic suggesting a need for further taxonomic revisions at these levels. A divergence time analysis provides key insights into the origins of major lineages and events and the timing of morphological (body form) and ecological (habitat) transitions. Living anomuran biodiversity is the product of 2 major changes in the tempo of diversification our initial insights suggest that the acquisition of a crab-like form did not act as a key inNovemberation.

Recent work shows that the fitness effect of a given resistance mutation is influenced by other resistance mutations on the same genome. However, resistant bacteria acquire additional beneficial mutations during evolution in the absence of antibiotics that do not alter resistance directly but may modify the fitness effects of new resistance mutations. Results: We experimentally evolved rifampicin-resistant and sensitive Escherichia coli in a drug-free environment, before measuring the effects of new resistance elements on fitness in antibiotic-free conditions. Streptomycin-resistance mutations had small fitness effects in rifampicin-resistant genotypes that had adapted to antibiotic-free growth medium, compared to the same genotypes without adaptation. We observed a similar effect when resistance was encoded by a different mechanism and carried on a plasmid. Antibiotic-sensitive bacteria that adapted to the same conditions showed the same pattern for some resistance elements but not others. Conclusions: Epistatic variation of costs of resistance can result from evolution in the absence of antibiotics, as well as the presence of other resistance mutations.

However, the direct links between the deleterious mutations or deletions in these two genes and several human disorders, such as inherited inflammatory calcified tumors and acute myeloid leukemia, suggest their biological importance. SAMD9 and SAMD9L have also recently been shown to play key roles in the innate immune responses to stimuli such as viral infection. We were particularly interested in understanding the mammalian evolutionary history of these two genes. The phylogeny of SAMD9 and SAMD9L genes was reconstructed using the Maximum Likelihood method. Furthermore, six different methods were applied to detect SAMD9 and SAMD9L codons under selective pressure: the site-specific model M8 implemented in the codeml program in PAML software and five methods available on the Datamonkey web server, including the Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting method, the Fixed Effect Likelihood method, the Random Effect Likelihood method, the Mixed Effects Model of Evolution method and the Fast Unbiased Bayesian AppRoximation method. Additionally, the house mouse (Mus musculus) genome has lost the SAMD9 gene, while keeping SAMD9L intact, prompting us to investigate whether this loss is a unique event during evolution. Results: Our evolutionary analyses suggest that SAMD9 and SAMD9L arose through an ancestral gene duplication event after the divergence of Marchsupialia from Placentalia. Additionally, selection analyses demonstrated that both genes have been subjected to positive evolutionary selection. The absence of either SAMD9 or SAMD9L genes from some mammalian species supports a partial functional redundancy between the two genes. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first study on the evolutionary history of mammalian SAMD9 and SAMD9L genes. We conclude that evolutionary selective pressure has acted on both of these two genes since their divergence, suggesting their importance in multiple cellular processes, such as the immune responses to viral pathogens.

EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH	adaptive radiation microsatellites phylogeography stickleback	GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS PHYLOGENETIC TREES ADAPTIVE RADIATION COUNTING ALLELES SYMPATRIC FORMS DIVERGENCE SPECIATION CONSERVATION RAREFACTION EVOLUTION	Background: The presence of ecological opportunity can trigger adaptive radiation. Freshwater colonization of Marchine ancestors during the post-glacial dispersal could have triggered adaptive radiation in the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Japanese Marchine threespine stickleback can be classified into two genetically divergent groups, the Pacific Ocean group and the Japan Sea group. Question: Are all Japanese freshwater threespine stickleback populations derived from the Pacific Ocean lineage? Or are some freshwater populations derived from the evolutionarily divergent Japan Sea lineage? Methods: We collected stickleback from 22 different locations across Japan, including nine freshwater populations, five Pacific Ocean anadromous populations, and eight Japan Sea anadromous populations. We determined the genotypes for 11 different microsatellite Marchkers. We created phylogenies using different measures of genetic distance based on both allele frequencies and allele lengths. We inferred population structure using Bayesian analysis. Results: All freshwater populations analysed were genetically similar to the Pacific Ocean anadromous populations, suggesting that they are likely derived from the Pacific Ocean lineage rather than the Japan Sea lineage.

Parasitic plants provide an ideal test for these predictions, as there are at least a dozen independent origins of the parasitic lifestyle in angiosperms. Studies of a number of parasitic plant lineages have suggested faster rates of molecular evolution, but the results of some studies have been mixed. Comparative analysis of all parasitic plant lineages, including sequences from all three genomes, is needed to examine the generality of the relationship between rates of molecular evolution and parasitism in plants. Results: We analysed DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial, nuclear and chloroplast genomes for 12 independent evolutionary origins of parasitism in angiosperms. We demonstrated that parasitic lineages have a faster rate of molecular evolution than their non-parasitic relatives in sequences for all three genomes, for both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions. Conclusions: Our results prove that raised rates of molecular evolution are a general feature of parasitic plants, not confined to a few taxa or specific genes. We discuss possible causes for this relationship, including increased positive selection associated with host-parasite arms races, relaxed selection, reduced population size or repeated bottlenecks, increased mutation rates, and indirect causal links with generation time and body size. We find no evidence that faster rates are due to smaller effective populations sizes or changes in selection pressure. Instead, our results suggest that parasitic plants have a higher mutation rate than their close non-parasitic relatives. This may be due to a direct connection, where some aspect of the parasitic lifestyle drives the evolution of raised mutation rates. Alternatively, this pattern may be driven by an indirect connection between rates and parasitism: for example, parasitic plants tend to be smaller than their non-parasitic relatives, which may result in more cell generations per year, thus a higher rate of mutations arising from DNA copy errors per unit time. Demonstration that adoption of a parasitic lifestyle influences the rate of genomic evolution is relevant to attempts to infer molecular phylogenies of parasitic plants and to estimate their evolutionary divergence times using sequence data.

This study uses simulations under a variety of different sample sizes (number of tips) and asymmetries of rate (speciation, extinction, character change) to determine BiSSE's ability to test hypotheses, and investigate whether the method is susceptible to confounding effects. Results: We found that the power of the BiSSE method is severely affected by both sample size and high tip ratio bias (one character state dominates among observed tips). Sample size and high tip ratio bias also reduced accuracy and precision of parameter estimation, and resulted in the inability to infer which rate asymmetry caused the excess of a character state. In low tip ratio bias scenarios with appropriate tip sample size, BiSSE accurately estimated the rate asymmetry causing character state excess, avoiding the issue of confounding effects. Conclusions: Based on our findings, we recommend that future studies utilizing BiSSE that have fewer than 300 terminals and/or have datasets where high tip ratio bias is observed (i.e., fewer than 10% of species are of one character state) should be extremely cautious with the interpretation of hypothesis testing results.

For example, stream stickleback generally have deeper bodies than do lake stickleback. Parallel divergence of this sort is often used to infer the power and predictability of natural selection, but how rapidly such lake-stream differences can evolve is unknown. An opportunity to address this uncertainty was provided when two reservoirs on the Hendry Vineyard in Napa, California, were constructed in the early 1970s and filled with water (and thus stickleback) from the adjacent creek. Question: Do reservoir and creek stickleback on the Hendry Vineyard show morphological divergence typical of lake and stream stickleback? Samples: Stickleback from the reservoirs and creek in each of two years, combined with stickleback from six lake-stream pairs on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Methods: Multivariate analyses of univariate traits and geometric morphometric variables. Results: Reservoir and creek stickleback differed only Marchginally in morphology, especially compared with lake and stream stickleback from Vancouver Island. In contrast to low divergence between habitats on the Hendry Vineyard, morphological variation was very high within habitats. Conclusions: Reservoir-creek divergence in Hendry Vineyard stickleback is seemingly constrained by a combination of weak divergent selection, high gene flow, and limited time for divergence. On the other hand, the high variation within these populations might be used to study the origins and fate of phenotypic variation.

However, the role played by the symbiont has been more guessed by indirect means than evidenced. Symbiont-harboring trypanosomatids, in contrast to their counterparts lacking symbionts, exhibit lower nutritional requirements and are autotrophic for essential amino acids. To evidence the symbiont's contributions to this autotrophy, entire genomes of symbionts and trypanosomatids with and without symbionts were sequenced here. Results: Analyses of the essential amino acid pathways revealed that most biosynthetic routes are in the symbiont genome. By contrast, the host trypanosomatid genome contains fewer genes, about half of which originated from different bacterial groups, perhaps only one of which (ornithine cyclodeaminase, EC: 4.3.1.12) derived from the symbiont. Nutritional, enzymatic, and genomic data were jointly analyzed to construct an integrated view of essential amino acid metabolism in symbiont-harboring trypanosomatids. This comprehensive analysis showed perfect concordance among all these data, and revealed that the symbiont contains genes for enzymes that complete essential biosynthetic routes for the host amino acid production, thus explaining the low requirement for these elements in symbiont-harboring trypanosomatids. Phylogenetic analyses show that the cooperation between symbionts and their hosts is complemented by multiple horizontal gene transfers, from bacterial lineages to trypanosomatids, that occurred several times in the course of their evolution. Transfers occur preferentially in parts of the pathways that are missing from other eukaryotes. Conclusion: We have herein uncovered the genetic and evolutionary bases of essential amino acid biosynthesis in several trypanosomatids with and without endosymbionts, explaining and complementing Decemberades of experimental results. We uncovered the reMarchkable plasticity in essential amino acid biosynthesis pathway evolution in these protozoans, demonstrating heavy influence of horizontal gene transfer events, from Bacteria to trypanosomatid nuclei, in the evolution of these pathways.

BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Larvae Evolution Adaptation Planktotrophy Gastraea Trochaea Dipleurula	MOLLUSK ILYANASSA-OBSOLETA CILIARY BANDS LARVAL DEVELOPMENT TROCHOPHORA LARVAE ECHINODERM LARVAE ANIMAL EMBRYOS NERVOUS-SYSTEM FEEDING LARVAE PHYLOGENETIC SIGNIFICANCE COORDINATED SHIFTS	Background: Two theories for the origin of animal life cycles with planktotrophic larvae are now discussed seriously: The terminal addition theory proposes a holopelagic, planktotrophic gastraea as the ancestor of the eumetazoans with addition of benthic adult stages and retention of the planktotrophic stages as larvae, i.e. the ancestral life cycles were indirect. The intercalation theory now proposes a benthic, deposit-feeding gastraea as the bilaterian ancestor with a direct development, and with planktotrophic larvae evolving independently in numerous lineages through specializations of juveniles. Results: Information from the fossil record, from mapping of developmental types onto known phylogenies, from occurrence of apical organs, and from genetics gives no direct information about the ancestral eumetazoan life cycle however, there are plenty of examples of evolution from an indirect development to direct development, and no unequivocal example of evolution in the opposite direction. Analyses of scenarios for the two types of evolution are highly informative. The evolution of the indirect spiralian life cycle with a trochophora larva from a planktotrophic gastraea is explained by the trochophora theory as a continuous series of ancestors, where each evolutionary step had an adaptational advantage. The loss of ciliated larvae in the ecdysozoans is associated with the loss of outer ciliated epithelia. A scenario for the intercalation theory shows the origin of the planktotrophic larvae of the spiralians through a series of specializations of the general ciliation of the juvenile. The early steps associated with the enhancement of swimming seem probable, but the following steps which should lead to the complicated downstream-collecting ciliary system are without any advantage, or even seem disadvantageous, until the whole structure is functional. None of the theories account for the origin of the ancestral deuterostome (ambulacrarian) life cycle. Conclusions: All the available information is strongly in favor of multiple evolution of non-planktotrophic development, and only the terminal addition theory is in accordance with the Darwinian theory by explaining the evolution through continuous series of adaptational changes. This implies that the ancestor of the eumetazoans was a holopelagic, planktotrophic gastraea, and that the adult stages of cnidarians (sessile) and bilaterians (creeping) were later additions to the life cycle. It further implies that the various larval types are of considerable phylogenetic value.

This system has shown Marchked evolution during mammalian divergence in such complex attributes as activation time and recovery time. We have performed a molecular evolutionary analysis of proteins involved in mammalian phototransduction in order to unravel how the action of natural selection has been distributed throughout the system to evolve such traits. Results: We found selective pressures to be non-randomly distributed according to both a simple protein classification scheme and a protein-interaction network representation of the signaling pathway. Proteins which are topologically central in the signaling pathway, such as the G proteins, as well as retinoid cycle chaperones and proteins involved in photoreceptor cell-type determination, were found to be more constrained in their evolution. Proteins peripheral to the pathway, such as ion channels and exchangers, as well as the retinoid cycle enzymes, have experienced a relaxation of selective pressures. Furthermore, signals of positive selection were detected in two genes: the short-wave (blue) opsin (OPN1SW) in hominids and the rod-specific Na+/Ca2+, K+ ion exchanger (SLC24A1) in rodents. Conclusions: The functions of the proteins involved in phototransduction and the topology of the interactions between them have imposed non-random constraints on their evolution. Thus, in shaping or conserving system-level phototransduction traits, natural selection has targeted the underlying proteins in a concerted manner.

This advantage can alter host population genetics because Wolbachia-infected females produce more offspring with their own mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes than uninfected females. Thus, these host haplotypes become common or fixed (selective sweep). Although simulations suggest that for a CI-mediated sweep to occur, there must be a transient phase with repeated initial infections of multiple individual hosts by different Wolbachia strains, this has not been observed empirically. Wolbachia has been found in the tsetse fly, Glossina fuscipes fuscipes, but it is not limited to a single host haplotype, suggesting that CI did not impact its population structure. However, host population genetic differentiation could have been generated if multiple Wolbachia strains interacted in some populations. Here, we investigated Wolbachia genetic variation in G. f. fuscipes populations of known host genetic composition in Uganda. We tested for the presence of multiple Wolbachia strains using Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) and for an association between geographic region and host mtDNA haplotype using Wolbachia DNA sequence from a variable locus, groEL (heat shock protein 60). Results: MLST demonstrated that some G. f. fuscipes carry Wolbachia strains from two lineages. GroEL revealed high levels of sequence diversity within and between individuals (Haplotype diversity = 0.945). We found Wolbachia associated with 26 host mtDNA haplotypes, an unprecedented result. We observed a geographical association of one Wolbachia lineage with southern host mtDNA haplotypes, but it was non-significant (p = 0.16). Though most Wolbachia-infected host haplotypes were those found in the contact region between host mtDNA groups, this association was non-significant (p = 0.17). Conclusions: High Wolbachia sequence diversity and the association of Wolbachia with multiple host haplotypes suggest that different Wolbachia strains infected G. f. fuscipes multiple times independently. We suggest that these observations reflect a transient phase in Wolbachia evolution that is influenced by the long gestation and low reproductive output of tsetse. Although G. f. fuscipes is superinfected with Wolbachia, our data does not support that bidirectional CI has influenced host genetic diversity in Uganda.

However, some siderophores seem redundant, because they have limited iron-binding efficiency and are seldom expressed under iron limitation. Here, we investigate the conundrum of why selection does not eliminate this apparent redundancy. We focus on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that can produce two siderophores-the highly efficient but metabolically expensive pyoverdine, and the inefficient but metabolically cheap pyochelin. We found that the bacteria possess molecular mechanisms to phenotypically switch from mainly producing pyoverdine under severe iron limitation to mainly producing pyochelin when iron is only moderately limited. We further show that strains exclusively producing pyochelin grew significantly better than strains exclusively producing pyoverdine under moderate iron limitation, whereas the inverse was seen under severe iron limitation. This suggests that pyochelin is not redundant, but that switching between siderophore strategies might be beneficial to trade off efficiencies versus costs of siderophores. Indeed, simulations parameterized from our data confirmed that strains retaining the capacity to switch between siderophores significantly outcompeted strains defective for one or the other siderophore under fluctuating iron availabilities. Finally, we discuss how siderophore switching can be viewed as a form of collective Decemberision-making, whereby a coordinated shift in behaviour at the group level emerges as a result of positive and negative feedback loops operating among individuals at the local scale.

Bacteriocins, protein-based toxins produced by nearly all bacteria, have generally been considered a ubiquitous anti-competitor strategy, used to kill competing bacterial strains. Some of these bacteriocins are encoded on plasmids, which also code for closely linked immunity compounds (thereby rendering toxin producing cells immune to their own toxin). However, the production of bacteriocins can also be interpreted as a means to promote plasmid stability by preferentially selecting for cells carrying the plasmid. If, for example, a cell were to lose the plasmid, it would no longer produce the immunity compound and would be killed by its bacteriocin-producing clone mates. In this respect, bacteriocins can be regarded as similar to previously described toxin-antitoxin systems that are able promote the stable transmission of plasmids to dAugusthter cells. In order to test this prediction, we carried out an experimental evolution study using the bacterium Escherichia coli, finding that bacteriocins can indeed select for the stable maintenance of plasmids. This suggests that bacteriocins can act priMarchily as selfish genetic elements promoting their own transmission in the population, which may help explain their unique ecology and evolution.

Mutators have a particular advantage when multiple beneficial mutations are needed for fitness, as in antibiotic resistance. Nevertheless, high mutation rates potentially lead to increasing numbers of deleterious mutations and subsequently to the Decemberreased fitness of mutators. To test how fitness changed with mutation accumulation, genome sequencing and fitness assays of nine Escherichia coli mutY mutators were undertaken in an evolving chemostat population at three timepoints. Unexpectedly, the fitness in members of the mutator subpopulation became constant despite a growing number of mutations over time. To test if the accumulated mutations affected fitness, we replaced each of the known beneficial mutations with wild-type alleles in a mutator isolate. We found that the other 25 accumulated mutations were not deleterious. Our results suggest that isolates with deleterious mutations are eliminated by competition in a continuous culture, leaving mutators with mostly neutral mutations. Interestingly, the mutator-non-mutator balance in the population reversed after the fitness plateau of mutators was reached, suggesting that the mutator-non-mutator ratio in populations has more to do with competition between members of the population than the accumulation of deleterious mutations.

Balistids (triggerfishes) are largely circumtropical in coral reef environments while most monacanthids (filefishes, leatherjackets) are distributed across reef and non-reef habitats in the Indo-western Pacific. Although members of these clades share a distinctive mode of locomotion that relies upon coordinated oscillation or undulation of enlarged dorsal and anal fins, species richness as well as morphologial and ecological diversity are generally considered to be higher in monacanthids than in triggerfishes. Explicit evolutionary comparisons of diversity patterns between these sister clades have been hampered by the paucity of systematic studies of filefishes relative to triggerfishes. Furthermore, a well-sampled molecular timescale for balistoids is lacking, hindering our understanding of the evolutionary history of these fishes. Here, we produce the largest balistoid molecular dataset to date, based on two mitochondrial and three nuclear loci, for a total of 86 species, and we time-calibrate it using three tetraodontiform fossils. We show that several of the traditional monacanthid genera are not monophyletic and that the balistid Xenobalistes tumidipectoris is nested within the genus Xanthichthys, and suggest that the generic name Xenobalistes be dissolved. Our timetree reveals a Late Miocene origin of balistids, in accordance with previous studies, but a Late Eocene age for the crown monacanthids, which experienced significant diversification during the Late Oligocene and Early Miocene. Comparative analyses reveal no significant family-level differences in rates of speciation or body size evolution, suggesting that the greater diversity of filefishes can be attributed to their more ancient crown age compared to triggerfishes.

Two general growth forms exist: the economically and ecologically important woody bamboos (tribes Arundinarieae and Bambuseae), and the understory herbaceous bamboos (tribe Olyreae). Evolutionary relationships among the 1400 + described species have been difficult to resolve with confidence. Comparative analysis of bamboo plastid (chloroplast) DNA has revealed three to five major lineages that show distinct biogeographic distributions. Taxon sampling across tribes and subtribes has been incomplete and most published data sets include a relatively small number of nucleotide characters. Branching order among lineages is often poorly supported, and in more than one study herbaceous bamboos form a clade within the woody bamboos. In this paper, the Bamboo Phylogeny Group presents the most complete phylogeny estimation to date of bamboo tribes and subtribes using 6.7 kb of coding and noncoding sequence data and 37 microstructural characters from the chloroplast genome. Quality of data is assessed, as is the possibility of long branch attraction, the degree of character conflict at key nodes in the tree, and the legitimacy of three alternative hypotheses of relationship. Four major plastid lineages are recognized: temperate woody, paleotropical woody, neotropical woody, and herbaceous bamboos. Woody bamboos are resolved as paraphyletic with respect to Olyreae but SH tests cannot reject monophyly of woody species (Arundinarieae + Bambuseae). Published by Elsevier Inc.

This arms race has produced a suite of counter-adaptations in moths, including bat-detecting ears. One set of defensive strategies involves the active production of sound tiger moths' ultrasonic replies to bat attack have been shown to startle bats, warn the predators of bad taste and jam their biosonar. Here, we report that hawk-moths in the Choerocampina produce entirely ultrasonic sounds in response to tactile stimulation and the playback of biosonar attack sequences. Males do so by grating modified scraper scales on the outer surface of the genital valves against the inner Marchgin of the last abdominal tergum. Preliminary data indicate that females also produce ultrasound to touch and playback of echolocation attack, but they do so with an entirely different mechanism. The anti-bat function of these sounds is unknown but might include startling, cross-family acoustic mimicry, warning of unprofitability or physical defence and/or jamming of echolocation. Hawkmoths present a Novemberel and tractable system to study both the function and evolution of anti-bat defences.

However, to what extent can the use of specific behaviors be associated with particular types of selection on morphological traits? Laboratory selection analyses on waterfall-climbing gobiid fishes were performed to investigate how behavioral variations in locomotion can affect patterns of linear and nonlinear morphological selection. Species from sister genera (Sicyopterus stimpsoni and Sicydium punctatum) that use different climbing behaviors were exposed to similar artificial waterfalls to simulate a controlled selective regime involving the climbing of a nearly vertical slope against flowing water. Juvenile S. stimpsoni inch up waterfalls by alternate attachment of oral and pelvic suckers with little axial or fin movement, leading to straightforward expectations that climbing selection should favor morphologies that improve drag reduction and substrate adhesion. In contrast, juvenile S. punctatum climb using substantial axial and fin movements, complicating expectations for selection patterns and potentially promoting correlational selection. Comparisons of directional, quadratic and correlational selection coefficients for various morphological traits and trait interactions indicated that these species showed different selection patterns that generally fit these predictions. Both directional and correlational selection patterns were different between the species, and on average were stronger in S. punctatum compared to S. stimpsoni. Stronger selection in S. punctatum may be related to its climbing style that requires more integrated movement of the fins and body axis than S. stimpsoni, promoting dynamic interactions among body regions within a complicated hydrodynamic environment.

Parents and offspring interact repeatedly over time for the provision of parental care. Their behaviours should be accordingly adjusted to each other dynamically and adaptively, and the phenotypic match between offspring age and parental stage should stabilize the repeated behavioural interactions. In the European earwig (Forficula auricularia), maternal care is beneficial for offspring survival, but not vital, allowing us to investigate the extent to which the stability of mother-offspring aggregation is shaped by age-dependent coadaptation. In this study, we experimentally cross-fostered nymphs of different age classes (younger or older) between females in early or late reproductive stage to disrupt age-dependent coadaptation, thereby generating female-nymph dyads that were phenotypically matched or mismatched. The results revealed a higher stability in aggregation during the first larval instar when care is most intense, a steeper Decemberline in aggregation tendency over developmental time and a reduced developmental rate in matched compared with mismatched families. Furthermore, nymph survival was positively correlated with female-nymph aggregation stability during the early stages when maternal care is most prevalent. These results support the hypothesis that age-related phenotypically plastic coadaptation affects family dynamics and offspring developmental rate.

Here I respond by pointing out that their reiterated scenario still requires mutually exclusive paths of motion and I show that their assertions of methodological shortcomings are tangential and lack merit. Overall, this discussion provides an opportunity to examine in greater detail competing hypothesis about behaviors and taxonomic identity of the trace maker, and relevance thereof to competing theories regarding early events in the evolution of pterygote insects.

Within individual genes, codon bias is stronger at evolutionarily conserved residues, favoring codons recognized by abundant tRNAs. Although this observation suggests an overall pattern of selection for translation speed and/or accuracy, other work indicates that transcript structure or binding motifs drive codon usage. However, our understanding of codon bias evolution is constrained by limited experimental data on the fitness effects of altering codons in functional genes. To bridge this gap, we generated synonymous variants of a key enzyme-coding gene in Methylobacterium extorquens. We found that mutant gene expression, enzyme production, enzyme activity, and fitness were all significantly lower than wild-type. Surprisingly, encoding the gene using only rare codons Decemberreased fitness by 40%, whereas an allele coded entirely by frequent codons Decemberreased fitness by more than 90%. Increasing gene expression restored mutant fitness to varying degrees, demonstrating that the fitness disadvantage of synonymous mutants arose from a lack of beneficial protein rather than costs of protein production. Protein production was negatively correlated with the frequency of motifs with high affinity for the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence, suggesting ribosome pausing as the dominant cause of low mutant fitness. Together, our data support the idea that, although a particular set of codons are favored on average across a genome, in an individual gene selection can either act for or against codons depending on their local context.

The lack of lateral transfer of nitrogen-fixation genes from prokaryotes to eukaryotes has been partially attributed to the physiological requirements necessary for the function of the nitrogenase complex. However, symbiotic bacterial nitrogenase activity is protected by the nodule, a plant structure whose organogenesis can be trigged in the absence of bacteria. To explore the intrinsic potentiality of this plant organ, we generated rhizobium-independent nodules in alfalfa by overexpressing the MsDMI3 kinase lacking the autoinhibitory domain. These transgenic nodules showed similar levels of leghemoglobin, free oxygen, ATP, and NADPH to those of efficient Sinorhizobium meliloti B399-infected nodules, suggesting that the rhizobium-independent nodules can provide an optimal microenvironment for nitrogenase activity. Finally, we discuss the intrinsic evolutionary constraints on transfer of nitrogen-fixation genes between bacteria and eukaryotes.

This disparity is often hypothesized to be the result of evolutionary constraints on obstetric dimensions related to bipedalism and/or thermoregulation in later hominins. Previous attempts to test such hypotheses have used biomechanical methods and results have been mixed. But evolutionary constraints, restrictions or limitations on the course or outcome of evolution, are the result of an interaction between selective pressures and genetic constraints-the latter revealed in patterns of integration. Integration between traits can result in directional or stabilizing selection on one trait leading to correlated responses in other traits, which can bias and constrain evolutionary trajectories. Therefore, trait evolution may be constrained for reasons Septemberarate from those that can be estimated using biomechanical models, and to study evolutionary constraints it is necessary to understand the role genetic constraints play in morphological change. The results presented here show that genetic constraints can significantly reduce the evolutionary potential of the birth canal to evolve in humans, apes, and likely earlier hominins, but also point to an overall reduction in the level of constraints during hominin evolution. These findings suggest that divergent selection pressures for obstetric requirements and other pelvic functions in hominins reduced levels of genetic constraint on birth canal evolution, likely lowering the amount of time needed for evolutionary change, and permitting morphological evolution along a trajectory that might have previously been difficult or impossible to traverse.

ReMarchkably, their evolutionary history has received little attention, and there is no firm agreement on how many species should be recognized within the black rat complex. This species complex is native to India and Southeast Asia. According to current taxonomic classification, there are three taxa living in sympatry in several parts of Thailand, Cambodia and Lao People's Democratic Republic, where this study was conducted: two accepted species (Rattus tanezumi, Rattus sakeratensis) and an additional mitochondrial lineage of unclear taxonomic status referred to here as Rattus R3. We used extensive sampling, morphological data and diverse genetic Marchkers differing in rates of evolution and parental inheritance (two mitochondrial DNA genes, one nuclear gene and eight microsatellite loci) to assess the reproductive isolation of these three taxa. Two close Asian relatives, Rattus argentiventer and Rattus exulans, were also included in the genetic analyses. Genetic analyses revealed discordance between the mitochondrial and nuclear data. Mitochondrial phylogeny studies identified three reciprocally monophyletic clades in the black rat complex. However, studies of the phylogeny of the nuclear exon interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein gene and clustering and assignation analyses with eight microsatellites failed to Septemberarate R. tanezumi and R3. Morphometric analyses were consistent with nuclear data. The incongruence between mitochondrial and nuclear (and morphological) data rendered R. tanezumi/R3 paraphyletic for mitochondrial lineages with respect to R. sakeratensis. Various evolutionary processes, such as shared ancestral polymorphism and incomplete lineage sorting or hybridization with massive mitochondrial introgression between species, may account for this unusual genetic pattern in mammals.

Despite empirical work on the macroevolution and macroecology of minimum and maximum size, there is little general quantitative theory on rates and limits of body size evolution. We present a general theory that integrates individual productivity, the lifestyle component of the slow-fast life-history continuum, and the allometric scaling of generation time to predict a clade's evolutionary rate and asymptotic maximum body size, and the shape of macroevolutionary trajectories during diversifying phases of size evolution. We evaluate this theory using data on the evolution of clade maximum body sizes in mammals during the Cenozoic. As predicted, clade evolutionary rates and asymptotic maximum sizes are larger in more productive clades (e.g. baleen whales), which represent the fast end of the slow-fast lifestyle continuum, and smaller in less productive clades (e.g. primates). The allometric scaling exponent for generation time fundamentally alters the shape of evolutionary trajectories, so allometric effects should be accounted for in models of phenotypic evolution and interpretations of macroevolutionary body size patterns. This work highlights the intimate interplay between the macroecological and macroevolutionary dynamics underlying the generation and maintenance of morphological diversity.

The importance of these implications compels anthropologists to attempt body mass estimation from fragmentary fossil hominin specimens. Most calculations require a known calibration sample usually composed of modern humans or other extant apes. Caution must be taken in these analyses, as estimates are sensitive to overall size and allometric differences between the fossil hominin and the reference sample.

In Drosophila melanogaster, there are three BMP-encoding genes: Decemberapentaplegic (dpp), glass bottom boat (gbb) and screw (scw). dpp and gbb are found in all groups of insects. In contrast, the origin of scw via duplication of an ancestral gbb homologue is more recent, with new evidence placing it within the Diptera. Recent studies show that scw appeared basal to the Schizophora, since scw orthologues exist in aschizan cyclorrhaphan flies. In order to further localise the origin of scw, we have utilised new genomic resources for the nematoceran moth midge Clogmia albipunctata (Psychodidae). We identified the BMP subclass members dpp and gbb from an early embryonic transcriptome and show that their expression patterns in the blastoderm differ considerably from those seen in cyclorrhaphan flies. Further searches of the genome of C. albipunctata were unable to identify a scw-like gbb duplicate, but confirm the presence of dpp and gbb. Our phylogenetic analysis shows these to be clear orthologues of dpp and gbb from other non-cyclorrhaphan insects, with C. albipunctata gbb branching ancestrally to the cyclorrhaphan gbb/scw split. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that scw is absent from all Nematocera, including the Bibionomorpha. We conclude that the gbb/scw duplication occurred between the Septemberaration of the lineage leading to Brachycera and the origin of cyclorrhaphan flies 200-150 Ma ago.

Models of this process typically assume random encounters. However, offspring are often more likely to encounter their mother's parasites. Because parents and offspring are genetically similar, they may be susceptible to the same parasite strains and thus, in hosts, maternal transmission should select for mechanisms that Decemberrease intergenerational genetic similarity. In parasites, however, maternal transmission should select for genetic similarity. We develop and analyse a model of host and parasite mutation rate evolution when parasites are maternally inherited. In hosts, we find that maternal transmission has two opposing effects. First, it eliminates coevolutionary cycles that previous work shows select for higher mutation. Second, it independently selects for higher mutation rates, because offspring that differ from their mothers are more likely to avoid infection. In parasites, however, the two effects of maternal transmission act in the same direction. As for hosts, maternal transmission eliminates coevolutionary cycles, thereby reducing selection for increased mutation. Unlike for hosts, however, maternal transmission additionally selects against higher mutation by favouring parasite offspring that are the same as their mothers.

On the basis of the evolution of key C4 enzyme genes, the evolution of C4 photosynthesis has been considered a story of gene/genome duplications and subsequent modifications of gene function. If whole-genome duplication has contributed to the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, other genes should have been duplicated together with these C4 genes. However, which genes were co-duplicated with C4 genes and whether they have also played a role in C4 evolution are largely unknown. In this study, we developed a simple method to characterize the historical profile of the paralogs of a gene by tracing back to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the gene and its paralog(s) and then counting the number of paralogs at each MRCA. We clustered the genes into clusters with similar duplication profiles and inferred their functional enrichments. Applying our method to maize, a familiar C4 plant, we identified many genes that show similar duplication profiles with those of the key C4 enzyme genes and found that the functional preferences of the C4 gene clusters are not only similar to those identified by an experimental approach in a recent study but also highly consistent with the functions required for the C4 photosynthesis evolutionary model proposed by S.F. Sage. Some of these genes might have co-evolved with the key C4 enzyme genes to increase the strength of C4 photosynthesis. Moreover, our results suggested that most key C4 enzyme genes had different origins and have undergone a long evolutionary process before the emergence of C4 grasses (Andropogoneae), consistent with the conclusion proposed by previous authors.

For all these investigations, valid identification, mainly of sibling and cryptic species as well as early life history stages, represents a central issue. In this study, we compare species identification methods for pelagic calanoid copepod species from the North Sea and adjacent regions in a total of 333 specimens. Morphologically identified specimens were analysed on the basis of nucleotide sequences (i.e. partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and complete 18S rDNA) and on proteome fingerprints using the technology of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). On all three molecular approaches, all specimens were classified to species level indicated by low intraspecific and high interspecific variability. Sequence divergences in both Marchkers revealed a second Pseudocalanus species for the southern North Sea identified as Pseudocalanus moultoni by COI sequence comparisons to GenBank. Proteome fingerprints were valid for species clusters irrespective of high intraspecific variability, including significant differences between early developmental stages and adults. There was no effect of sampling region or time thus, trophic effect, when analysing the whole organisms, was observed in species-specific protein mass spectra, underlining the power of this tool in the application on metazoan species identification. Because of less sample preparation steps, we recommend proteomic fingerprinting using the MALDI-TOF MS as an alternative or supplementary approach for rapid, cost-effective species identification.

Fine-scale phylogeographic and population genetic analyses of three sympatric and independently derived species of amphipod (Chiltoniidae) were carried out to determine whether there were common patterns of population genetic structure or evidence for past geographic isolation of populations within a single calcrete aquifer. Genetic diversity in amphipod mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene) and allozymes were examined across a 3.5 km(2) region of the Sturt Meadows calcrete, which contains a grid of 115 bore holes (=wells). Stygobiont amphipods were found to have high levels of mitochondrial haplotype diversity coupled with low nucleotide diversity. Mitochondrial phylogeographic structuring was found between haplogroups for one of the chiltoniid species, which also showed population structuring for nuclear Marchkers. Signatures of population expansion in two of the three species, match previous findings for diving beetles at the same site, indicating that the system is dynamic. We propose isolation of populations in refugia within the calcrete, followed by expansion events, as the most likely source of intraspecific genetic diversity, due to changes in water level influencing gene flow across the calcrete.

These fungi were once treated as an order (Caliciales) of the Ascomycota but many are now known to be nested within the Arthoniomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Lecanoromycetes and Leotiomycetes. In this study we employ multigene phylogenetic analyses of main mazaediate groups (based on nuclear 18S, 28S, 5.8S rDNA, mitochondrial 16S, and the protein coding RPB1 and Mcm7) of 116 taxa corresponding to most major groups of the inoperculate ascomycetes (Leotiomyceta) and a selection of Pezizomycetes, to trace the evolution of the mazaedium in the Pezizomycotina (the Euascomycetes). In particular, we studied the placement of three calicioid groups of uncertain position, Calycidiaceae, Coniocybaceae and Microcaliciaceae. Here, we show that the Calycidiaceae is closely related to the Sphaerophoraceae in the Lecanoromycetidae (Lecanoromycetes), as supported by overall morphology and the production of sphaerophorin. The Coniocybaceae constitute an early divergent line in the inoperculate ascomycetes and here we propose to recognize this group formally as the new class and order Coniocybomycetes, Coniocybales. The Microcaliciaceae is nested within the Ostropomycetidae (Lecanoromycetes). Both Coniocybaceae and Microcaliciaceae, although highly distinctive, lack morphological similarities to related main fungal groups. Ancestral state reconstruction suggests that the ancestor of all inoperculate ascomycetes and the ancestor of all main inoperculate ascomycete groups, with the exception of the Coniocybomycetes, was non-mazediate, and thus confirms the large amount of parallel evolution and independent gains of the mazaedium in the history of the Ascomycota.

For populations evolving under weak mutation on a time-invariant fitness landscape, I argue that one appropriate measure is the expected waiting time, starting from equilibrium, for a population to become fixed for a given genotype. Under this definition for the findability of genotypes, I show that for any pair of genotypes (1) a population at equilibrium is always more likely to fix at the more findable before the less findable genotype and (2) the expected time to evolve from the more findable to the less findable genotype is always greater that the expected time to evolve in the opposite direction. Although increasing the fitness of a genotype always increases its findability, in general there is no simple relationship between the rank ordering of genotypes by fitness and the rank ordering of genotypes by findability. I also present a method for quantifying the relative contributions of mutation, selection, substitution rate, and probability of reversion to a genotype's findability.

Until recently, it was believed that only plants, microorganisms, and fungi were capable of synthesizing carotenoids and that animals acquired them from their diet, but recent studies have demonstrated that two arthropods (pea aphid and spider mite) possess a pair of genes homologous to those required for the first step of carotenoid biosynthesis. Absent in all other known animal genomes, these genes appear to have been acquired by aphids and spider mites in one or several lateral gene transfer events from a fungal donor. We report the third case of fungal carotenoid biosynthesis gene homologs in an arthropod: flies from the family Cecidomyiidae, commonly known as gall midges. Using phylogenetic analyses we show that it is unlikely that lycopene cyclase/phytoene synthase and phytoene desaturase homologs were transferred singly to an ancient arthropod ancestor instead we propose that genes were transferred independently from related fungal donors after divergence of the major arthropod lineages. We also examine variation in intron placement and copy number of the carotenoid genes that may underlie function in the midges. This trans-kingdom transfer of carotenoid genes may represent a key inNovemberation, underlying the evolution of phytophagy and plant-galling in gall midges and facilitating their extensive diversification across plant lineages.

It is an excellent candidate for exploring the evolution of intercontinental disJunect distributions in the Old World. Previous phylogenetic work of Vitaceae with a few species of Cayratia sampled showed that Cayratia was not monophyletic and was closely related to Cyphostemma and Tetrastigma. We herein expanded taxon sampling of Cayratia (25/60 species) with its allied genera Cyphostemma (39/150 species), Tetrastigma (27/95 species), and other related genera from Vitaceae represented, employing five plastid Marchkers (atpB-rbcL, rps16, trnC-petN, trnH-psbA, and trnL-F), to investigate the phylogeny, character evolution and biogeography of Cayratia. The phylogenetic analyses have confirmed the monophyly of the Cayratia-Cyphostemma-Tetrastigma (CCT) clade and resolved Cayratia into three lineages: the African Cayratia clade, subg. Cayratia, and subg. Discypharia. The African Cayratia was supported as the first diverging lineage within the CCT clade and Tetrastigma is resolved as sister to subg. Discypharia. Character optimizations suggest that the presence/absence of a membrane enclosing the ventral infolds in seeds is an important character for the taxonomy of Cayratia. The presence of bracts on the lower part of the inflorescence axis is inferred to have arisen only once in Cayratia, but this character evolved several times in Tetrastigma. Both the branching pattern of tendrils and the leaf architecture are suggested as important infrageneric characters, but should be used cautiously because some states evolved multiple times. Ancestral area reconstruction and molecular dating suggest that the CCT clade originated from continental Africa in the late Cretaceous, and it then reached Asia twice independently in the late Cretaceous and late Oligocene, respectively. Several dispersals are inferred from Asia to Australia since the Eocene. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In addition, several cetacean species exhibit geographical ranges that encompass different Marchine environments, with genetic breaks being sometimes consistent with environmental breaks. As such, genes that underwent adaptation during the land-sea transition can also be potential candidates for adaptation to different oceanic environments. In this study, we analysed 3 milk protein genes (beta-casein, kappa-casein, and alpha-lactalbumin) and 2 immunity related genes (MHC DQ beta 1 and gamma-fibrinogen) for selection based on available phylogenetic datasets of both mammals and cetaceans, and used the results from this analysis to assess adaptation to different environments on a population level in the European common dolphin (Delphinus delphis). We found that evidence for positive selection could be detected in all genes in the phylogenetic analyses, with beta-casein showing a further increase in selective pressure in the cetacean lineage. At the population level, both the immune system locus DQ beta 1 and beta-casein genes showed patterns of variation consistent with divergent selection, and in each case the same populations showed differentiation. One of these populations was also differentiated at neutral Marchkers, while the other was not. We discuss possible inference, and the potential for the further development of these ideas using genomic technologies.

BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	climate change climatic selection polymorphism selective predation	GENE-FREQUENCY MarchLBOROUGH DOWNS POLYMORPHISM COLONY TIME	Changes in morph frequency over time in sand-dune populations of Cepaea nemoralis in the British Isles have been examined using the Evolution Megalab database. Frequencies in colonies on a sand dune at Berrow, Somerset were estimated in 20089. This extends a survey started in 1926 by A. E. Boycott and C. Diver and continued in the mid-20th Century by B. C. Clarke and J. J. Murray. An increase in the frequency of the mid-banded morph, noted in earlier work, has continued. The apparent Decemberrease in brown was not confirmed but the yellow frequency has increased. At a range of dunes in the British Isles, comparisons between data from the mid-20th Century and the early 21st Century indicate an increase in yellow and mid-banded morphs and a Decemberrease in banding and brown morphs. These results differ from the overall trends derived from Europe-wide comparison of early data with Evolution Megalab data, in which banded and mid-banded increased in frequency, whereas there was no overall change in yellow. The general pattern of regional variation has been retained, although there is also high heterogeneity between samples, suggesting that a variety of factors are involved in explaining the changes. The mean shifts in frequency are consistent with climatic change over the period. Dunes are probably the most likely habitat in which to detect such a change.

Because asexuals are often polyploid, understanding how ploidy influences phenotype is directly relevant to the study of sex and will provide key insights into the evolution of ploidy-level variation. The well-established association between genome size and cell cycle duration, evidence for a link between genome size and tissue regeneration rate and the growing body of research showing that ploidy influences growth rate and gene expression led us to hypothesize that healing and tissue regeneration might be affected by ploidy-level variation. We evaluated this hypothesis by measuring the rate of regeneration of antenna tissue of Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a New Zealand snail characterized by frequent coexistence between diploid sexuals and polyploid asexuals. Antennae of triploid and presumptive tetraploid asexuals regenerated more rapidly than the antennae of diploid sexuals, but regeneration rate did not differ between triploids and tetraploids. These results suggest either that ploidy elevation has nonlinear positive effects on tissue regeneration and/or that factors associated directly with reproductive mode affect regeneration rate more than ploidy level. The results of this study also indicate that the lower ploidy of sexual P. antipodarum is unlikely to confer advantages associated with more rapid regeneration.

In the Wright-Fisher diffusion, such dynamics is captured by the transition density function, which satisfies well-known partial differential equations. For a multi-allelic model with general diploid selection, various theoretical results exist on representations of the transition density, but finding an explicit formula has remained a difficult problem. In this paper, a technique recently developed for a diallelic model is extended to find an explicit transition density for an arbitrary number of alleles, under a general diploid selection model with recurrent parent-independent mutation. Specifically, the method finds the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the generator associated with the multi-allelic diffusion, thus yielding an accurate spectral representation of the transition density. Furthermore, this approach allows for efficient, accurate computation of various other quantities of interest, including the normalizing constant of the stationary distribution and the rate of convergence to this distribution.

Recent molecular analyses proposed that the extant Dinomys (and implicitly its fossil allies) is also part of this group. Their relationships with fossil caviomorphs with less derived dental features are still obscured by the deficiency of the fossil record documenting its early dental evolution. The new genus and species Garridomys curunuquem, from the early Miocene deposits of the Cerro Bandera Formation, northern Patagonia, is here described. It is represented by numerous mandible and maxillary remains with dentition. This species has protohypsodont cheek teeth with three transverse crests in all ontogenetic stages arranged in a transitory S-shaped pattern, resembling putative early dinomyids. Garridomys curunuquem is here interpreted as the sister group of the clade including the living and fossil chinchillids both chinchillas and viscaccias would have diverged from a Garridomys-like ancestor and acquired hypsodonty independently. Garridomys and other chinchilloids would have diverged from the lineage leading to chinchillids in pre-Oligocene times, suggesting a very early, still poorly documented chinchilloid radiation.

Most mammals encode at least two endochitinases (CHIT1 and CHIA/AMCase), as well as several homologues encoding catalytically inactive chitinase-like proteins or chilectins (all GH18 family proteins). It is becoming increasingly apparent that chitinases and chilectins play an important role in inflammation and their over-expression is correlated with numerous pathological conditions. We have conducted a detailed phylogenomic study of this gene family in order to understand its evolutionary history and the selection forces at work. The family has undergone extensive expansion, initiating with a duplication event at the root of the vertebrate tree generating the ancestors of CHIT1 and CHIA. Our analyses indicate that two further duplications of ancestral CHIA predate the divergence of bony fishes, one leading to a newly identified paralogous group (we have termed CHIO). In fish these sequences fall into two clades bearing the hallMarchks of the teleost-specific genome duplication (referred to as 3R). In tetrapods, additional duplications predate and postdate the amphibian/mammalian split and relics of some exist as pseudogenes in the human genome. Expansion and selection of chilectins is pronounced in mammals and CHI3L1 (with a proposed function in immunity) is found in most mammals but not other vertebrates, while CHI3L2 is also evident in reptiles. Notably oviductin (OVGP1) became basic and gained a glycosylated tail with its evolving role in the mammalian reproductive system. In each case, retention of the sugar-binding barrel structure has constrained positive selection to limited sites.

AMERICAN NATURALIST	Bogert effect chromosomal inversion polymorphism clinal variation phenotypic plasticity temperature thermal preferences	THERMAL PREFERENCE NATURAL-POPULATION GENETIC-VARIATION SEASONAL-CHANGES TIME-SERIES NULL MODEL TEMPERATURE POLYMORPHISM EVOLUTION COADAPTATION	Chromosomal inversion clines paralleling the long-standing ones in native Palearctic populations of Drosophila subobscura evolved swiftly after this species invaded the Americas in the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, the new clines did not consistently continue to converge on the Old World baseline. Our recent survey of Chilean populations of D. subobscura shows that inversion clines have faded or even changed sign with latitude. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that this fading of inversion clines might be due to the Bogert effect, namely, that flies' thermoregulatory behavior has eventually compensated for environmental variation in temperature, thus buffering selection on thermal-related traits. We show that latitudinal divergence in thermal preference (T-p) has evolved in Chile for females, with higher-latitude flies having a lower mean T-p. Plastic responses in T-p also lessen latitudinal thermal variation because flies developed at colder temperatures prefer warmer microclimates. Our results are consistent with the idea that active behavioral thermoregulation might buffer environmental variation and reduce the potential effect of thermal selection on other traits as chromosomal arrangements.

While recent advances in sequencing and genotyping methods are leading to rapidly increasing amounts of genome-wide sequence data that reveal interesting patterns of genetic variation within inverted regions, efficient simulation methods to study these patterns are largely missing. In this work, we extend the sequential Marchkovian coalescent, an approximation to the coalescent with recombination, to include the effects of polymorphic inversions on patterns of recombination. Results show that our algorithm is fast, memory-efficient and accurate, making it feasible to simulate large inversions in large populations for the first time. The SMC algorithm enables studies of patterns of genetic variation (for example, linkage disequilibria) and tests of hypotheses (using simulation-based approaches) that were previously intractable.

We used comparative linkage mapping with shared gene-based Marchkers to identify potential chromosomal rearrangements between the sister monkeyflowers Mimulus lewisii and Mimulus cardinalis, which are textbook examples of ecological speciation. We then remapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for floral traits and flowering time (premating isolation) and hybrid sterility (postzygotic isolation). We identified three major regions of recombination suppression in the M. lewisii x M. cardinalis hybrid map compared to a relatively collinear Mimulus parishii x M. lewisii map, consistent with a reciprocal translocation and two inversions specific to M. cardinalis. These inferences were supported by targeted intraspecific mapping, which also implied a M. lewisii-specific reciprocal translocation causing chromosomal pseudo-linkage in both hybrid mapping populations. Floral QTLs mapped in this study, along with previously mapped adaptive QTLs, were clustered in putatively rearranged regions. All QTLs for male sterility, including two underdominant loci, mapped to regions of recombination suppression. We argue that chromosomal rearrangements may have played an important role in generating and consolidating barriers to gene flow as natural selection drove the dramatic ecological and morphological divergence of these species.

Several mutations with drastic effects on circadian processes have been identified and models developed to explain how clock genes and their products generate self-sustained oscillations. Although natural variations in circadian phenotypes have been studied extensively, the genetic basis of such adaptive variations remains largely unknown. Here we report the results of a preliminary genetic analysis of adaptive divergence of circadian phenotypes in populations of fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster. Two sets of populations, 'early' and 'late', were created in a long-term laboratory selection for morning and evening emergence, with four independent replicates each. Over the course of similar to 55 generations, the early flies evolved increased morning emergence and a shorter circadian period, whereas late flies evolved increased evening emergence and longer period. To examine the genetic basis of circadian phenotypes, we set up crosses between early and late flies, and monitored emergence and activity/rest rhythms in the F1, backcrossed and F2 progeny. Our analysis suggests that the genetic basis of divergent circadian phenotypes in early and late stocks is priMarchily autosomal. Line-cross analysis revealed that additive and non-additive genetic effects contribute to the divergence of circadian phenotypes in early and late flies.

Animals that are forced to be active around the clock typically show reduced performance, health and survival. Nevertheless, we review evidence of animals showing prolonged intervals of activity with attenuated or nil overt circadian rhythms and no apparent ill effects. We show that around-the-clock and ultradian activity patterns are more common than is generally appreciated, particularly in herbivores, in animals inhabiting polar regions and habitats with constant physical environments, in animals during specific life-history stages (such as migration or reproduction), and in highly social animals. The underlying mechanisms are diverse, but studies suggest that some circadian pacemakers continue to measure time in animals active around the clock. The prevalence of around-the-clock activity in diverse animals and habitats, and an apparent diversity of underlying mechanisms, are consistent with convergent evolution. We suggest that the basic organizational principles of the circadian system and its complexity encompass the potential for chronobiological plasticity. There may be trade-offs between benefits of persistent daily rhythms versus plasticity, which for reasons still poorly understood make overt daily arrhythmicity functionally adaptive only in selected habitats and for selected lifestyles.

However, while clines in quantitative traits and genetic polymorphisms have been observed within and across continents, few studies have attempted to demonstrate direct links between them. The gene methuselah in Drosophila has been shown to have a major effect on stress response and longevity phenotypes based largely on laboratory studies of induced mutations in the mth gene. Clinal patterns in the most common mth haplotype and for lifespan (both increasing with latitude) have been observed in North American populations of D.melanogaster, implicating climatic selection. While these clinal patterns have led some to suggest that mth influences ageing in natural populations, limited evidence on the association between the two has so far been collected. Here, we describe a significant cline in the mth haplotype in eastern Australian D.melanogaster populations that parallel the cline in North America. We also describe a cline in mth gene expression. These findings further support the idea that mth is itself under selection. In contrast, we show that lifespan has a strong nonlinear clinal pattern, increasing southwards from the tropics, but then Decemberreasing again from mid-latitudes. Furthermore, in association studies, we find no evidence for a direct link between mth haplotype and lifespan. Thus, while our data support a role for mth variation being under natural selection, we found no link to naturally occurring variation in lifespan and ageing in Australian populations of D.melanogaster. Our results indicate that the mth locus likely has genetic background and environment-specific effects.

Takifugu rubripes (fugu) is a large Marchine pufferfish whose genome has been sequenced, whereas T. niphobles is the smallest species among Takifugu. We show that, unsurprisingly, the juvenile growth rate of T. rubripes is higher than that of T. niphobles in a laboratory setting. We produced F2 progenies of their F1 hybrids and found one quantitative trait locus (QTL) significantly associated with variation in juvenile body size. This QTL region (3.5 Mb) contains no known genes directly related to growth phenotype (such as IGFs) except Fgf21, which inhibits growth hormone signaling in mouse. The QTL in Takifugu spp. is distinct from the region previously known to control body size variations in stickleback or tilapia. Our results suggest that in the fish tested herein, genomic regions underlying body size evolution might have different genetic origins. They also suggest that many diverse traits in Takifugu spp. are amenable to genetic mapping.

Here, we analyse the genomic architecture of these heritable traits in a wild great tit (Parus major) population, using three Marchker-based approaches - chromosome partitioning, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The variance explained by each great tit chromosome scales with predicted chromosome size, no location in the genome contains genome-wide significant QTL, and no individual SNPs are associated with a large proportion of phenotypic variation, all of which may suggest that variation in both traits is due to many loci of small effect, located across the genome. There is no evidence that any regions of the genome contribute significantly to both traits, which combined with a small, nonsignificant negative genetic covariance between the traits, suggests the absence of genetic constraints on the independent evolution of these traits. Our findings support the hypothesis that variation in life history traits in natural populations is likely to be determined by many loci of small effect spread throughout the genome, which are subject to continued input of variation by mutation and migration, although we cannot exclude the possibility of an additional input of major effect genes influencing either trait.

Dictyostelid social amoebas have used this strategy for over 600 Myr to form fruiting structures of increasing complexity. To understand in which order multicellular complexity evolved, we measured 24 phenotypic characters over 99 dictyostelid species. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that the last common ancestor (LCA) of Dictyostelia probably erected small fruiting structures directly from aggregates. It secreted cAMP to coordinate fruiting body morphogenesis, and another compound to mediate aggregation. This phenotype persisted up to the LCAs of three of the four major groups of Dictyostelia. The group 4 LCA co-opted cAMP for aggregation and evolved much larger fruiting structures. However, it lost encystation, the survival strategy of solitary amoebas that is retained by many species in groups 1-3. Large structures, phototropism and a migrating intermediate 'slug' stage coevolved as evolutionary Novemberelties within most groups. Overall, dictyostelids show considerable plasticity in the size and shape of multicellular structures, both within and between species. This probably reflects constraints placed by colonial life on developmental control mechanisms, which, depending on local cell density, need to direct from 10 to a million cells into forming a functional fructification.

Colour variability, both between and within species, can be caused by different colours being favoured for different functions and in different environments. Thus, species with highly variable coloration may have greater potential to persist in new and changing environments. As a consequence, such colour-variable species may be more able to adapt, colonize new areas and niches, occupy larger ranges, speciate more readily and in general be less vulnerable to environmental change and extinction. These predictions have been supported by comparative analyses on amphibians and reptiles. However, as coloration in ectotherms plays a key role in thermoregulation, it is unclear whether these results can be generalized to endotherms, such as birds and mammals. Here, we test the hypothesis that more colour-variable endotherms occupy larger ranges/niches and are less vulnerable to the threat of extinction by focussing on colour variation in Australian parrots and passerine birds. As predicted, colour variability was correlated with range size (parrots and passerines) and niche breadth (dietary heterogeneity, parrots only). These relationships support the predicted link between colour variability and adaptability, whereby range size and niche breadth may be a cause of colour variability or vice versa. Irrespective, and as predicted, colour variability was lower in threatened species, even after statistically controlling for other confounding variables. Hence, our study supports the hypothesis that colour-variable species in general are more resilient to environmental change.

In reptiles, CP is often genetically based and associated with alternative behavioural strategies, mainly in males for most cases. However, female colour morphs also display alternative reproductive strategies associated with behavioural and physiological traits, which may contribute to maintain CP in the population. Both sexes of the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) show three pure colour morphs, white, yellow and red. Here, we looked for the effects of male and female colour morphs on fitness traits of captive-breeding pairs. All yellow-throated females laid clutches of many small eggs and produced many light offspring, behaving as r-strategists, whereas white-throated females laid clutches of few large eggs and produced few heavy offspring, behaving as K-strategists. Red-throated females adopted a conditional Kr-strategy depending on their size/age. These basic female strategies were modulated in relation to mate morph: white females had the best fitness gain in terms of viable offspring when mated to red males mating between yellow morphs yielded a greater breeding success than all other morph crosses, but also lighter offspring finally, red females produced heavy progeny when paired with red or white males, and light offspring in pair with yellow males. Thus, correlation between CP and traits relevant to fitness combined with non-random mating, either assortative or disassortative, could increase the potential for CP to contribute to divergent evolution in the common wall lizard.

The original explanation for this costly helping behaviour invoked both direct and indirect fitness benefits. Several authors have since suggested that food sharing is maintained solely by indirect fitness because non-kin food sharing could have resulted from kin recognition errors, indiscriminate altruism within groups, or harassment. To test these alternatives, we examined predictors of food-sharing Decemberisions under controlled conditions of mixed relatedness and equal familiarity. Over a 2 year period, we individually fasted 20 vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) and induced food sharing on 48 days. Surprisingly, donors initiated food sharing more often than recipients, which is inconsistent with harassment. Food received was the best predictor of food given across dyads, and 8.5 times more important than relatedness. Sixty-four per cent of sharing dyads were unrelated, approaching the 67 per cent expected if nepotism was absent. Consistent with social bonding, the food-sharing network was consistent and correlated with mutual allogrooming. Together with past work, these findings support the hypothesis that food sharing in vampire bats provides mutual direct fitness benefits, and is not explained solely by kin selection or harassment.

Studies conducted in bats as a model system assume that shared evolutionary history has a maximum effect on the traits. However, this effect has not been quantified. In addition, the effect of levels of diet specialization on brain size remains unclear. We examined the role of diet on the evolution of brain size in Mormoopidae and Phyllostomidae using two comparative methods. Body mass explained 89% of the variance in brain volume. The effect of feeding behaviour (either characterized as feeding habits, as levels of specialization on a type of item or as handling behaviour) on brain volume was also significant albeit not consistent after controlling for body mass and the strength of the phylogenetic signal (). Although the strength of the phylogenetic signal of brain volume and body mass was high when tested individually, values in phylogenetic generalized least squares models were significantly different from 1. This suggests that phylogenetic independent contrasts models are not always the best approach for the study of ecological correlates of brain size in New World bats.

The unveiling of incongruent phylogeographic patterns in co-occurring species, on the other hand, may hint to overlooked differences in their life histories or microhabitat preferences. The woodlouse-hunter spiders of the genus Dysdera have undergone a major diversification on the Canary Islands. The species pair Dysdera alegranzaensis and Dysdera nesiotes are endemic to the island of Lanzarote and nearby islets, where they co-occur at most of their known localities. The two species stand in sharp contrast to other sympatric endemic Dysdera in showing no evidence of somatic (non-genitalic) differentiation. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of mitochondrial cox1 sequences from an exhaustive sample of D. alegranzaensis and D. nesiotes specimens, and additional mitochondrial (16S, L1, nad1) and nuclear genes (28S, H3) were analysed to reveal their phylogeographic patterns and clarify their phylogenetic relationships. Relaxed molecular clock models using five calibration points were further used to estimate divergence times between species and populations. Striking differences in phylogeography and population structure between the two species were observed. Dysdera nesiotes displayed a metapopulation-like structure, while D. alegranzaensis was characterized by a weaker geographical structure but greater genetic divergences among its main haplotype lineages, suggesting more complex population dynamics. Our study confirms that co-distributed sibling species may exhibit contrasting phylogeographic patterns in the absence of somatic differentiation. Further ecological studies, however, will be necessary to clarify whether the contrasting phylogeographies may hint at an overlooked niche partitioning between the two species. In addition, further comparisons with available phylogeographic data of other eastern Canarian Dysdera endemics confirm the key role of lava flows in structuring local populations in oceanic islands and identify localities that acted as refugia during volcanic eruptions.

Classical studies of this event contend that the outcome is a deterministic process predicted by the growth rate of the competing types a tenet called the Malthusian selection principle. Recent studies of competition indicate that the dynamics of selection is a stochastic process, regulated by the population size, the abundance and diversity of the resource, and predicted by evolutionary entropy a statistical parameter which characterizes the rate at which the population returns to the steady state condition after a random endogenous or exogenous perturbation. This tenet, which we will call the entropic selection principle entails the following relations: (a) When resources are constant, limited and diverse, variants with higher entropy will have a selective advantage and increase in frequency. (b) When resources undergo large variations in abundance and are singular, variants with lower entropy will have a selective advantage and increase in frequency. This article delineates the analytic, computational and empirical support for this tenet. We show moreover that the Malthusian selection principle, a cornerstone of classical evolutionary genetics, is the limit, as population size and resource abundance tends to infinity of the entropic selection principle. The Malthusian tenet is an approximation to the entropic selection principle an approximation whose validity increases with increasing population size and increasing resource abundance. Evolutionary entropy is a generic concept that characterizes the interaction dynamics of metabolic entities at several levels of biological organization: cellular, organismic and ecological. Accordingly, the entropic selection principle represents a general rule for explaining the processes of adaptation and evolution at each of these levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Theory holds that populations facing severe intraspecific competition will tend to use a wider range of resources, possibly even using entirely Novemberel resources that are less in demand. Yet, there have been few experimental tests of these ideas. Using the bacterial virus (bacteriophage) phi 6 as a model system, we examined whether competition for host resources promotes the evolution of Novemberel resource use. In the laboratory, phi 6 exhibits a narrow host range but readily produces mutants capable of infecting Novemberel bacterial hosts. Here, we show that when phi 6 populations were subjected to intense intraspecific competition for their standard laboratory host, they rapidly evolved new generalist morphs that infect Novemberel hosts. Our results therefore suggest that competition for host resources may drive the evolution of host range expansion in viruses. More generally, our findings demonstrate that intraspecific resource competition can indeed promote the evolution of Novemberel resource-use phenotypes.

Here, we introduce a new computational method, called Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomically coHerent elemenTs (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural selection on such elements. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and divergence. It obtains information about divergence from multiple outgroup genomes using a general statistical phylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data using an approximate expectation maximization algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods based on sumMarchy statistics describing polymorphism and divergence. To demonstrate the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding sites in the human genome.

Now, as biology moves towards an -omics' era, it is more important than ever to tackle the evolution of function and form by considering all those research areas involved in the regulation of phenotypes. Here, we review recent attempts to establish the nematode Pristionchus pacificus as a model organism that allows integrative studies of development and evo-devo, with ecology and population genetics. Originally developed for comparative study with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, P.pacificus provided insight into developmental pathways including dauer formation, vulva and gonad development, chemosensation, innate immunity and neurobiology. Its subsequent discovery across a wide geographic distribution in association with scarab beetles enabled its evaluation in a biogeographic context. Development of an evolutionary field station on La Reunion Island, where P.pacificus is present in high abundance across a number of widespread habitat types, allows examination of the microfacets of evolution processes of natural selection, adaptation and drift among populations can now be examined in this island setting. The combination of laboratory-based functional studies with fieldwork in P.pacificus has the long-term prospective to provide both proximate (mechanistic) and ultimate (evolutionary and ecological) causation and might therefore help to overcome the long-term divide between major areas in biology.

Many such methods have their roots in molecular evolution, as they use information derived from multiple sequence alignments. We show that the performance of current methods (e.g., PolyPhen-2 and SIFT) is improved significantly by optimizing their statistical models on evolutionarily balanced training data, where equal numbers of positive and negative controls within each evolutionary conservation class are used. Evolutionary balancing significantly reduces the false-positive rates for variants observed at highly conserved sites and false-negative rates for variants observed at fast evolving sites. Use of these improved methods enables more accurate forecasting when concordant diagnosis from multiple methods is regarded as a more reliable indicator of the prediction. Applied to a large exome variation data set, we find that the current methods produce concordant predictions for less than half of the population variants. These advances are implemented in a web resource for use in practical applications (www.mypeg.info, last accessed Marchch 13, 2013).

Recent studies show that condition-dependence patterns can vary within populations. Although long-term association is thought to promote honest signalling, no study has explored the influence of pairing context on the condition-dependence of male ornaments. In this study, we assessed the influence of natural variation in body condition on song rate in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) in three different situations: during short and long encounters with an unfamiliar female, and within heterosexual mated pairs. We found consistent individual differences in male directed and undirected song rate. Moreover, body condition had a positive effect on song rate in paired males. However, male song rate was not influenced by body condition during short or long encounters with unfamiliar females. Song rate appears to be an unreliable signal of condition to prospective females as even poor-condition birds can cheat and sing at a high rate. By contrast, paired females can reliably use song rate to assess their mate's body condition, and possibly the genetic quality. We propose that species' characteristics, such as mating system, should be systematically taken into account to generate relevant hypotheses about the evolution of condition-dependent male ornaments.

However, classical path analysis techniques ignore the nonindependence of observations due to phylogenetic relatedness among species, possibly leading to spurious results. Here, we present a simple method to perform phylogenetic confirmatory path analysis (PPA). We analyzed simulated datasets with varying amounts of phylogenetic signal in the data and a known underlying causal structure linking the traits to estimate Type I error and power. Results show that Type I error for PPA appeared to be slightly anticonservative (range: 0.0470.072) but path analysis models ignoring phylogenetic signal resulted in much higher Type I error rates, which were positively related to the amount of phylogenetic signal (range: 0.051 for ?= 0 to 0.916 for ?= 1). Further, the power of the test was not compromised when accounting for phylogeny. As an example of the application of PPA, we revisit a study on the correlates of aggressive broodmate competition across seven avian families. The use of PPA allowed us to gain greater insight into the plausible causal paths linking species traits to aggressive broodmate competition.

We tested these two hypotheses in a group of Palearctic green toads that diverged some 3.3million years ago. Using sibship analyses of sex-linked Marchkers, we show that all four species investigated share the same pair of sex chromosomes and a pattern of male heterogamety with drastically reduced X-Y recombination in males. Phylogenetic analyses of sex-linked sequences show that X and Y alleles cluster by species, not by gametolog. We conclude that X-Y homomorphy and fine-scale sequence similarity in these species do not stem from recent sex-chromosome turNovemberers, but from occasional X-Y recombination.

Experiments with microorganisms have advanced our understanding of how, when and why cooperation evolves, but the extent to which microbial cooperation can recapitulate aspects of animal behaviour is debated. For instance, understanding the evolution of behavioural response rules (how should one individual respond to another's Decemberision to cooperate or defect?) is a key part of social evolution theory, but the possible existence of such rules in social microbes has not been explored. In one specific context (biparental care in animals), cooperation is maintained if individuals respond to a partner's defection by increasing their own investment into cooperation, but not so much that this fully compensates for the defector's lack of investment. This is termed partial compensation'. Here, I show that partial compensation for the presence of noncooperating cheats' is also observed in a microbial social behaviour: the cooperative production of iron-scavenging siderophores by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A period of evolution in the presence of cheats maintains this response, whereas evolution in the absence of cheats leads to a loss of compensatory behaviour. These results demonstrate (i) the reMarchkable flexibility of bacterial social behaviour, (ii) the potential generality of partial compensation as a social response rule and (iii) the need for mathematical models to explore the evolution of response rules in multi-player social interactions.

Under conditions of uncertainty and asymmetric costs of 'false-positive' and 'false-negative' errors, biases can lead to mistakes in one direction but in so doing steer us away from more costly mistakes in the other direction. For example, we sometimes think sticks are snakes (which is harmless), but rarely that snakes are sticks (which can be deadly). We suggest that 'error management' biases: (i) have been independently identified by multiple interdisciplinary studies, suggesting the phenomenon is robust across domains, disciplines, and methodologies (ii) represent a general feature of life, with common sources of variation and (iii) offer an explanation, in error management theory (EMT), for the evolution of cognitive biases as the best way to manage errors under cognitive and evolutionary constraints.

Their low diversity and disparity have been interpreted as indicative of a Decemberline leading to their Cenomanian extinction. We describe the first post-Triassic ichthyosaur from the Middle East, Malawania anachronus gen. et sp. November. from the Early Cretaceous of Iraq, and re-evaluate the evolutionary history of parvipelvian ichthyosaurs via phylogenetic and cladogenesis rate analyses. Malawania represents a basal grade in thunnosaurian evolution that arose during a major Late Triassic radiation event and was previously thought to have gone extinct during the Early Jurassic. Its pectoral morphology appears surprisingly archaic, retaining a forefin architecture similar to that of its Early Jurassic relatives. After the initial latest Triassic radiation of early thunnosaurians, two subsequent large radiations produced lineages with Cretaceous representatives, but the radiation events themselves are pre-Cretaceous. Cretaceous ichthyosaurs therefore include distantly related lineages, with contrasting evolutionary histories, and appear more diverse and disparate than previously supposed.

We still know little about the evolution of their life cycles and whether there might be trade-offs between fitness components, limiting the evolutionary potential of these pathogens. In this study, we explored a trade-off between spore production capacity and latent period in Puccinia triticina, a fungal pathogen causing leaf rust on wheat. Using a simple multivariate (maNovembera) technique, we showed that the covariance between the two traits is under shared control of host and pathogen, with contributions from host genotype (57%), pathogen genotype (18.4%) and genotypexgenotype interactions (12.5%). We also found variation in sign and strength of genetic correlations for the pathogen, when measured on different host varieties. Our results suggest that these important pathogen life-history traits do not freely respond to directional selection and that precise evolutionary trajectories are contingent on the genetic identity of the interacting host and pathogen.

Using comparative genomics we identified two genes displaying overt heterogeneity between species. Although initial work suggested both were species specific, Cops-1 for C.parvum and Chos-1 for C.hominis, subsequent study identified an abridged ortholog of Cops-1 in C.hominis. Cops-1 and Chos-1 showed limited, but significant, similarity to each other and share common features: (i) telomeric location: Cops-1 is the last gene on chromosome 2, whilst Chos-1 is the first gene on chromosome 5, (ii) encode circa 50-kDa secreted proteins with isoelectric points above 10, (iii) are serine rich, and (iv) contain internal nucleotide repeats. Importantly, Cops-1 sequence contains specific SNPs with good discriminatory power useful epidemiologically. C.parvum-infected patient sera recognized a 50-kDa protein in antigen preparations of C.parvum but not C.hominis, consistent with Cops-1 being antigenic for patients. Interestingly, anti-Cops-1 monoclonal antibody (9E1) stained oocyst content and sporozoite surface of C.parvum only. This study provides a new example of protozoan telomeres as rapidly evolving contingency loci encoding putative virulence factors.

Incomplete and error-filled assemblies result in many annotation errors, especially in the number of genes present in a genome. This means that methods attempting to estimate rates of gene duplication and loss often will be misled by such errors and that rates of gene family evolution will be consistently overestimated. Here, we present a method that takes these errors into account, allowing one to accurately infer rates of gene gain and loss among genomes even with low assembly and annotation quality. The method is implemented in the newest version of the software package CAFE, along with several other Novemberel features. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method with extensive simulations and reanalyze several previously published data sets. Our results show that errors in genome annotation do lead to higher inferred rates of gene gain and loss but that CAFE 3 sufficiently accounts for these errors to provide accurate estimates of important evolutionary parameters.

Diversity, evolution and role of the most peculiar organ in the Cuscuta flower (dodder, Convolvulaceae)-the infrastaminal scales	PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION	Convolvulaceae Cuscuta Dodder Elaborate petals Evolution Flower morphology and development Infrastaminal scales Toxic latex and laticifers Mating system Pollination Reproductive biology Nectar and nectary Plant defense Sympetaly	CALIFORNICA COMPLEX CONVOLVULACEAE GENUS CUSCUTA NORTH-AMERICA PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS ARTICULATED LATICIFERS ELECTRON MICROSCOPY FLORAL MORPHOLOGY SUBGENUS GRAMMICA MAJOR LINEAGES DNA-SEQUENCES	Cuscuta (dodders) is the only genus in Convolvulaceae and the Solanales more broadly in which corolla-stamen structures called infrastaminal scales (IFS) have reached a high degree of elaboration and diversification in a great number of species. Historically, morphological diversity of IFS has provided some of the most useful taxonomic characters at the species-level. However, their function has not been determined. We have performed a comparative study of the IFS in 147 Cuscuta taxa using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and results were analyzed in relation to a Cuscuta phylogeny obtained from a combined analysis of nuclear ITS and plastid trnL-F sequences. The morphology and histochemistry of scales and/or trichomes on the staminal filaments were also examined in several other Convolvulaceae genera to provide a preliminary foundation for homology interpretation. To test the hypothesis that the role of IFS in Cuscuta is connected to sexual reproduction, we analyzed the correlations between scale characters and previously published values for pollen/ovule ratios and the number of stomata found in the nectary at the base of the ovary. While the correlations at the level of the entire genus were very low, subgeneric partitions revealed a strong relationship between scale characters and sexual reproduction indicators in subgenus Monogynella. However, this connection Decemberlined drastically in the subgenera Cuscuta and Grammica. Our results strongly suggest that scales in Cuscuta evolved in connection to a modification of their function in the flower: from nectar protection and holding in the first diverged subgenus Monogynella, to ovary/ovule protection against herbivorous insects in the derived subgenera Cuscuta and Grammica. Thus at least in the case of the latter subgenera, the protective/repellent role of the IFS may conflict with the attractant/rewarding function of the nectary found at the base of the ovary. In subgenus Monogynella, IFS fimbriae are similar to uniseriate glandular hairs, with the secretory cells entirely exposed. In the subgenera Grammica and Cuscuta, the fimbriae become more complex, with an internal distal laticifer, and a precise mechanism of latex release. Our study elaborates further on the development and ultrastructure of scales in C. groNovemberii, and provides details on the anatomy of the IFS in other species. The new morphology and micromorphology data confirm the significance of these structures for species-level systematics.

Based on phylogenetic analysis using nuclear ribosomal ITS and four plastid Marchkers (matIC, rbcL, psbA-trnH and trnG-S), our results strongly support the monophyly of Cyananthus and its close relationship with the Codonopsis clade of the platycodonoids. Three major clades are supported, corresponding to the three sections of the genus, with sect. Cyananthus, which mainly occurs in the Himalayas, being a sister to the clade comprising the other two sections (sect. Stenolobi and sect. Annul) distributed priMarchily in the Hengduan Mountain region. We also observed that Cyananthus exhibits variation in its sexual system, possessing both hermaphroditic and gynodioecious species. Character evolution analyses using Mesquite suggest that gynodioecy evolved from hermaphroditism only once in sect. Stenolobi, but that there is a reversal in C. forrnosus. Molecular dating and biogeographic analysis with LAGRANGE support dispersal from the Himalayas to the Hengduan Mountains during the early evolution of Cyananthus. The extensive uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the Hengduan Mountains played an important role in the subsequent diversification of the genus. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We evolved populations of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the presence of three herbicides: atrazine, glyphosate and carbetamide. Populations were exposed to a weekly, biweekly and triweekly cycling between all three pairwise combinations of herbicides and continuously to each of the three herbicides. We explored the impacts of herbicide cycling on the rate of resistance evolution, the level of resistance selected, the cost of resistance and the degree of generality (cross-resistance) observed. Herbicide cycling resulted in a diversity of outcomes: preventing evolution of resistance for some combinations of herbicides, having no impacts for others and increasing rates of resistance evolution in some instances. Weekly cycling of atrazine and carbetamide resulted in selection of a generalist population. This population had a higher level of resistance, and this generalist resistance was associated with a cost. The level of resistance selected did not vary amongst other regimes. Costs of resistance were generally highest when cycling was more frequent. Our data suggest that the effects of herbicide cycling on the evolution of resistance may be more complex and less favourable than generally assumed.

JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	evolutionary graph theory Hamilton's rule inclusive fitness kin selection mutualism relatedness	INCLUSIVE FITNESS KIN SELECTION STRONG RECIPROCITY PRICE EQUATION GENERAL-MODEL EVOLUTION MUTUALISM COOPERATION OPTIMIZATION POPULATIONS	Darwin suggested that the discovery of altruism between species would annihilate his theory of natural selection. However, it has not been formally shown whether between-species altruism can evolve by natural selection, or why this could never happen. Here, we develop a spatial population genetic model of two interacting species, showing that indiscriminate between species helping can be favoured by natural selection. We then ask if this helping behaviour constitutes altruism between species, using a linear-regression analysis to Septemberarate the total action of natural selection into its direct and indirect (kin selected) components. We show that our model can be interpreted in two ways, as either altruism within species, or altruism between species. This ambiguity arises depending on whether or not we treat genes in the other species as predictors of an individual's fitness, which is equivalent to treating these individuals as agents (actors or recipients). Our formal analysis, which focuses upon evolutionary dynamics rather than agents and their agendas, cannot resolve which is the better approach. Nonetheless, because a within-species altruism interpretation is always possible, our analysis supports Darwin's suggestion that natural selection does not favour traits that provide benefits exclusively to individuals of other species.

Some extensions and improvements of the penalised likelihood method originally presented by Sanderson are introduced. The improvements are the introduction of alternative models, including one with non-correlated rates of molecular substitution (relaxed model), a completely reworked fitting algorithm that considers the high-dimensionality of the optimisation problem, and the development of a new information criterion for model selection in the presence of a penalised term. It is also shown that the strict clock model is a special case of the present approach. An extensive simulation study was conducted to assess the statistical performance of these improvements. Overall, the different estimators studied here appeared as unbiased though their variance varied depending on the fitted and the simulated models and on the number of calibration points. The strict clock model gave good estimates of branch lengths even in the presence of heterogeneous substitution rates. The correlated model gave the best estimates of substitution rates whatever the model used to simulate the data. These results, which are certainly the first from an extensive simulation study of a molecular dating method, call for more comparison with alternative methods, as well as further work on the developments introduced here.

(2013) express some concerns about the conclusions of our recent study showing that management increases genetic diversity of honey bees (Apis mellifera) by promoting admixture (Harpur etal. 2012). We provide a brief review of the literature on the population genetics of A.mellifera and show that we utilized appropriate sampling methods to estimate genetic diversity in the focal populations. Our finding of higher genetic diversity in two managed A.mellifera populations on two different continents is expected to be the norm given the large number of studies documenting admixture in honey bees. Our study focused on elucidating how management affects genetic diversity in honey bees, not on how to best manage bee colonies. We do not endorse the intentional admixture of honey bee populations, and we agree with De la Rua etal. (2013) that native honey bee subspecies should be conserved.

We present an adaptation following neutrality process to explain the evolution of essential function of new genes. How new de Novembero originated genes become involved in pathways and interact with other old genes, and the exact functions of these new genes, however, remains largely undocumented. Examinations of the function of de Novembero origin and the function of noncoding RNA genes should become more frequent and appreciated in the future studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

EVOLUTION PHYLOGENOMICS	Deep-level relationships within Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya as well as the relationships of these three domains to each other require resolution. The ribosomal machinery, universal to all cellular life, represents a protein repertoire resistant to horizontal gene transfer, which provides a largely congruent signal necessary for reconstructing a tree suitable as a backbone for life's reticulate history. Here, we generate a ribosomal tree of life from a robust taxonomic sampling of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya to elucidate deep-level intra-domain and inter-domain relationships. Lack of phylogenetic information and systematic errors caused by inadequate models (that cannot account for substitution rate or compositional heterogeneities) or improper model selection compound conflicting phylogenetic signals from HGT and/or paralogy. Thus, we tested several models of varying sophistication on three different datasets, performed removal of fast-evolving or long-branched Archaea and Eukarya, and employed three different strategies to remove compositional heterogeneity to examine their effects on the topological outcome. Our results support a two-domain topology for the tree of life, where Eukarya emerges from within Archaea as sister to a Korarchaeota/ThauMarchchaeota (KT) or Crenarchaeota/KT clade for all models under all or at least one of the strategies employed. Taxonomic manipulation allows single-matrix and certain mixture models to vacillate between two-domain and three-domain phylogenies. We find that models vary in their ability to resolve different areas of the tree of life, which does not necessarily correlate with model complexity. For example, both single-matrix and some mixture models recover monophyletic Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota archaeal phyla. In contrast, the most sophisticated model recovers a paraphyletic Euryarchaeota but detects two large clades that comprise the Bacteria, which were recovered Septemberarately but never together in the other models. Overall, models recovered consistent topologies despite dataset modifications due to the removal of compositional bias, which reflects either ineffective bias reduction or robust datasets that allow models to overcome reconstruction artifacts. We recommend a comparative approach for evolutionary models to identify model weaknesses as well as consensus relationships. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Until now, these archives were studied mainly using the microfossil record, disregarding large amounts of DNA accumulated on the deep-sea floor. Accessing ancient DNA (aDNA) molecules preserved down-core would offer unique insights into the history of Marchine biodiversity, including both fossilized and non-fossilized taxa. Here, we recover aDNA of eukaryotic origin across four cores collected at abyssal depths in the South Atlantic, in up to 32.5 thousand-year-old sediment layers. Our study focuses on Foraminifera and Radiolaria, two major groups of Marchine microfossils also comprising diverse non-fossilized taxa. We describe their assemblages in down-core sediment layers applying both micropalaeontological and environmental DNA sequencing approaches. Short fragments of the foraminiferal and radiolarian small subunit rRNA gene recovered from sedimentary DNA extracts provide evidence that eukaryotic aDNA is preserved in deep-sea sediments encompassing the last glacial maximum. Most aDNA were assigned to non-fossilized taxa that also dominate in molecular studies of modern environments. Our study reveals the potential of aDNA to better document the evolution of past Marchine ecosystems and opens new horizons for the development of deep-sea palaeogenomics.

A comparison between a delayed selfing and a pollinator-dependent Schizanthus species of the high Andes	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY	Delayed selfing High Andes Mixed mating system Self-compatible Pollinator failure	PLANT MATING SYSTEMS S. GRAHAMII SOLANACEAE GENETIC DIVERSITY INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION INBREEDING DEPRESSION CROSS-FERTILIZATION FLOWERING PLANTS BREEDING SYSTEM POPULATION-SIZE EVOLUTION	Delayed selfing has been considered the best-of-both-worlds response to pollinator unpredictability because it can provide reproductive assurance without Decemberreasing outcrossing potential. According to this hypothesis, selfing rates in delayed selfing species should be highly variable in fluctuating pollinator environments. To test this prediction, as well to explore the consequences of delayed selfing on genetic patterns, we compared two sister species that grow in the high Andes of Chile: Schizanthus grahamii that exhibits delayed selfing and Schizanthus hookeri, which is self-compatible but requires pollinators for seed set. We estimated genetic diversity within and among five populations of each species using six shared microsatellites. Our results indicated that selfing rates in S. grahamii (range 0.07-0.81) were significantly more variable than in S. hookeri (range 0-0.26). The highest levels of selfing were found in the populations of S. grahamii located at highest altitudes (r = 0.78) and at northern Marchgin range, where pollinators are probably more scarce. These populations also showed the lowest allelic richness and heterozygosity values. Southern populations of S. grahamii had mixed mating, and showed heterozygosity and diversity values close to those detected for S. hookeri along all the sampled range. Selfing in this species results from geitonogamy, and did not covary with altitude. Schizanthus grahamii showed greater population differentiation than S. hookeri. Overall, our results indicated that selfing rates were widely variable in S. grahamii, with some populations predominantly selfing and others showing mixed mating. This pattern may be associated with the strong fluctuations in pollinator service that typically occur in the high Andes of Chile.

Specifically, interrelated demographic processes, such as gene surfing, high-density blocking, and competitive exclusion, can generate striking geographic contrasts in the distributions of genes and species. Here, we propose that well-studied evolutionary and ecological biogeographic patterns of postglacial recolonization, progressive island colonization, microbial sectoring, and even the 'Out of Africa' pattern of human expansion, are fundamentally similar, underpinned by a 'founder takes all' density-dependent principle. Additionally, we hypothesize that older historic constraints of density-dependent processes are seen today in the dramatic biogeographic shifts that occur in response to human-mediated extinction events, whereby surviving lineages rapidly expand their ranges to replace extinct sister taxa.

Previous functional studies of DMP1 have revealed various motifs playing a role in either mineralization or cell differentiation. We performed an evolutionary analysis of DMP1 to identify residues and motifs that were conserved during 220 millions years (Ma) of mammalian evolution, and hence have an important function. In silico search provided us with 41 sequences that were aligned and analyzed using the Hyphy program. We showed that DMP1 contains 55 positions that were kept unchanged for 220 Ma. We also defined in a more precise manner some motifs that were already known (i.e., cleavage sites, RGD motif, ASARM peptide, glycosaminoglycan chain attachment site, nuclear localization signal sites, and dentin sialophosphoprotein-binding site), and we found five, highly conserved, new functional motifs. In the near future, functional studies could be performed to understand the role played by them.

It is demonstrated that by the Early Cretaceous, Paederinae and Staphylininae were already diversified into groups, some of which now represent extant tribes but not the branches dominating in the modern biota. While the study of the Early Cretaceous rove beetle fauna pushes the estimated divergence time between Paederinae and Staphylininae down into the Jurassic, it also suggests that presently hyperdiverse groups of Staphylininae originated some time later than the Early Cretaceous. In addition to one new tribe, five new genera (Paleothius, Cretoprosopus, Thayeralinus, Paleowinus and Durothorax) and 17 new species are described in Staphylininae, and three new species of Mesostaphylinus are described in Paederinae. Mesostaphylinus fraternus (incertae sedis) is moved to the genus Thayeralinus (Staphylininae). (C) The Willi Hennig Society 2012.

I used a Novemberel experimental design that combined a cross-fostering approach with phenotypic manipulation of maternal body size that allowed me to disentangle prenatal and postnatal maternal effects. Using the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides as model organism, I found that a mother's body size affected egg size as well as the quality of postnatal maternal care, with larger mothers producing larger eggs and raising larger offspring than smaller females. However, with respect to the relative importance of prenatal and postnatal maternal effects on offspring growth, only the postnatal effects were important in determining offspring body size. Thus, prenatal effects can be offset by the quality of postnatal maternal care. This finding has implications for the coevolution of prenatal and postnatal maternal effects as they arise as a consequence of maternal body size. In general, my study provides evidence that there can be transgenerational phenotypic plasticity, with maternal size determining offspring size leading to a resemblance between mothers and their offspring above and beyond any direct genetic effects.

A few genera like Rupirana and Crossodactylodes have enigmatic phylogenetic positions, and relationships among major lineages within some families like Leptodactylidae remain ambiguous. To resolve these specific questions we used two approaches (1) a complete matrix approach representing >6.6 kb, including most major Hyloidea lineages (61 terminals) combining different methods of phylogenetic reconstruction and measures of node support and (2) a supermatrix approach >11.6 kb with a focus on Leptodactylidae. Both Rupirana and Crossodactylodes are unambiguously grouped with Paratelmatobius and Scythrophrys. The clade comprising these four genera is named Crossodactylodinae and embedded within Leptodactylidae. Crossodactylodinae is moderately supported as sister group of Leptodactylinae from (1) and as the sister group of the other Leptodactylidae from (2) with low support. Genera within Crossodactylodinae are scattered along a north-south axis in the Atlantic forest and their origins are very ancient (Paleocene). Such results stress the importance of the northern Atlantic forest in terms of conservation. Moreover, the position of Pseudopaludicola, which is well supported as the sister group to all other Leiuperinae, suggests that foam-nest building may have arisen independently in Leptodactylinae and Leiuperinae. Moreover, in spite of being of similar age, foam-nest builders are more widespread than nonfoam-nest breeders and have higher species diversity. Nevertheless, the bulk of the diversity within foam-nest breeders arose some 20 Myr later than the character itself. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Unlike most other animal species, monarchs are largely insensitive to cardenolides, because their target site, the sodium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase), has evolved amino acid substitutions that reduce cardenolide binding (so-called target site insensitivity, TSI). Because many, but not all, species of milkweed butterflies (Danaini) are associated with cardenolide-containing host plants, we analyzed 16 species, representing all phylogenetic lineages of milkweed butterflies, for the occurrence of TSI by sequence analyses of the Na+/K+-ATPase gene and by enzymatic assays with extracted Na+/K+-ATPase. Here we report that sensitivity to cardenolides was reduced in a stepwise manner during the macroevolution of milkweed butterflies. Strikingly, not all Danaini typically consuming cardenolides showed TSI, but rather TSI was more strongly associated with sequestration of toxic cardenolides. Thus, the interplay between bottom-up selection by plant compounds and top-down selection by natural enemies can explain the evolutionary sequence of adaptations to these toxins.

The maintenance of such variation is not well understood, but it has been suggested to be the result of an interaction between sexual and natural selection. This interaction could also facilitate the evolution of sexual dichromatism. Here we analyse in detail the colour patterns of the poison frog Dendrobates tinctorius and evaluate the possible correlates of the variability in aposematic signals in a natural population. Against the theoretical predictions of aposematism, we found that there is enormous intra-populational variation in colour patterns and that these also differ between the sexes: males have a yellower dorsum and bluer limbs than females. We discuss the possible roles of natural and sexual selection in the maintenance of this sexual dimorphism in coloration and argue that parental care could work synergistically with aposematism to select for yellower males.

Specifically, what is the influence of a recently acquired gene on the function of an existing gene? For example, certain members of the genus Corynebacterium have horizontally acquired a whole l-tryptophan biosynthetic operon, whereas in certain closely related actinobacteria, for example, Mycobacterium, the trpF gene is missing. In Mycobacterium, the function of the trpF gene is performed by a dual-substrate (beta alpha)(8) phosphoribosyl isomerase (priA gene) also involved in l-histidine (hisA gene) biosynthesis. We investigated the effect of a HGT-acquired TrpF enzyme upon PriA's substrate specificity in Corynebacterium through comparative genomics and phylogenetic reconstructions. After comprehensive in vivo and enzyme kinetic analyses of selected PriA homologs, a Novemberel (beta alpha)(8) isomerase subfamily with a specialized function in l-histidine biosynthesis, termed subHisA, was confirmed. X-ray crystallography was used to reveal active-site mutations in subHisA important for narrowing of substrate specificity, which when mutated to the naturally occurring amino acid in PriA led to gain of function. Moreover, in silico molecular dynamic analyses demonstrated that the narrowing of substrate specificity of subHisA is concomitant with loss of ancestral protein conformational states. Our results show the importance of HGT in shaping enzyme evolution and metabolism.

Among these, the rooting of the placental mammal tree is still a controversial issue. One difficulty lies in the pervasive phylogenetic conflicts among genes, with each one telling its own story, which may be reliable or not. Here, we identified a simple criterion, that is, the GC content, which substantially helps in determining which gene trees best reflect the species tree. We assessed the ability of 13,111 coding sequence alignments to correctly reconstruct the placental phylogeny. We found that GC-rich genes induced a higher amount of conflict among gene trees and performed worse than AT-rich genes in retrieving well-supported, consensual nodes on the placental tree. We interpret this GC effect mainly as a consequence of genome-wide variations in recombination rate. Indeed, recombination is known to drive GC-content evolution through GC-biased gene conversion and might be problematic for phylogenetic reconstruction, for instance, in an incomplete lineage sorting context. When we focused on the AT-richest fraction of the data set, the resolution level of the placental phylogeny was greatly increased, and a strong support was obtained in favor of an Afrotheria rooting, that is, Afrotheria as the sister group of all other placentals. We show that in mammals most conflicts among gene trees, which have so far hampered the resolution of the placental tree, are concentrated in the GC-rich regions of the genome. We argue that the GC content-because it is a reliable indicator of the long-term recombination rate-is an informative criterion that could help in identifying the most reliable molecular Marchkers for species tree inference.

Despite considerable theoretical work, models of fixation probability have stood untested for nearly a century. However, recent advances in experimental and theoretical techniques permit the development of models with testable predictions. We developed a new model for the probability of surviving genetic drift, a major component of fixation probability, for Novemberel beneficial mutations in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans, based on the life-history characteristics of its colony growth on a solid surface. We tested the model by measuring the probability of surviving drift in 11 adapted strains introduced into wild-type populations of different densities. We found that the probability of surviving drift increased with mutant invasion fitness, and Decemberreased with wild-type density, as expected. The model accurately predicted the survival probability for the majority of mutants, yielding one of the first direct tests of the extinction probability of beneficial mutations.

However, the developmental trajectories of cerebral tissues have not been explored in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), even though they are our closest living relatives. To address this lack of information, the development of cerebral tissues was tracked in growing chimpanzees during infancy and the juvenile stage, using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging and compared with that of humans and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Overall, cerebral development in chimpanzees demonstrated less maturity and a more protracted course during prepuberty, as observed in humans but not in macaques. However, the rapid increase in cerebral total volume and proportional dynamic change in the cerebral tissue in humans during early infancy, when white matter volume increases dramatically, did not occur in chimpanzees. A dynamic reorganization of cerebral tissues of the brain during early infancy, driven mainly by enhancement of neuronal connectivity, is likely to have emerged in the human lineage after the split between humans and chimpanzees and to have promoted the increase in brain volume in humans. Our findings may lead to powerful insights into the ontogenetic mechanism underlying human brain enlargement.

PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION	Caryophyllaceae Dianthus polylepis complex Morphology Molecular phylogeny Iran	PHYLOGENETIC NETWORKS AGGLOMERATIVE METHOD DIVERSIFICATION SPECIATION MarchKERS UTILITY PLANTS GENES POLLINATION RATES	Dianthus polylepis complex consists of two already known endemic species, Dianthus polylepis and D. binaludensis, in Khorassan-Kopetdagh floristic province. The taxonomic position of these species has long been debated. The aim of the present study is to shed light on the evolutionary relationships of the members of the complex using morphological and molecular data. In morphological study, firstly, 56 vegetative and floral characters were measured on 33 specimens of the both species. Multivariate analyses were performed on 25 (out of 56) significantly discriminating morphological traits. In molecular study, we sequenced alleles obtained from a region between 2nd and 6th exons of the gene coding for the enzyme dihydroflavonol 4-reductase copy1 (DFR1). Morphological results show that most of a priori identified accessions were not grouped in a posteriori classification. It is difficult to discriminate D. polylepis from D. binaludensis in morphological continuum among the accessions. Results obtained from the molecular data indicated no monophyly for the members of the D. polylepis complex. Consistency between the morphological and molecular results shows that D. polylepis and D. binaludensis were not morphologically and molecularly well differentiated. Therefore, we propose a new combination as D. polylepis subsp. binaludensis.

The genus Scaphander is a group of predominantly deep-sea, infaunal cephalaspids with about 40% of its species (eight) occurring on the Atlantic Ocean. They are carnivorous and have a unique digestive system with a large, strongly muscularized gizzard containing three sizable and heavily calcified plates. This work aims to describe the diet of Scaphander, to evaluate if there is a functional relation between the anatomy of the digestive tract and exploitation of Novemberel food resources, and to assess if dietary specialization may have played a role in the diversification of the Atlantic species of Scaphander. Gut contents were studied from 31 specimens representing seven of the Atlantic species using scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. The chemical composition of the gizzard plates was analysed by X-ray microanalysis and X-ray powder diffraction. Foraminiferans, including agglutinating forms, were shown to be the most important food item for Scaphander bivalves, gastropods, scaphopods, and polychaetes with calcareous tubes were also found to form part of the diet. The gizzard plates were shown to consist of a phosphate-rich amorphous component and a crystalline component identified as fluorite (hardness 4 Moh's scale). It is suggested that the ability of Scaphander gastropods to prey upon organisms with hard tests, particularly agglutinating foraminiferans, is not only due to the hardness of the gizzard plates but to the cumulative effect of shape and hardness of the gizzard plates and relative size of the gizzard and associated musculature. No interspecific differences were found in the diet and morphology of the digestive tract, indicating that dietary specialization probably has not played a significant role in the diversification of Atlantic species of Scaphander.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 512-525.

Here we present a model that encapsulates non-genomic phenotypic variation in a population over two distinct environments that each act as a stimulus for epigenetic modification. By allowing different levels of epigenetic resetting, thereby increasing epigenetic diversity, we explore the dynamics of multiple epiallelic states subject to selection in a population-epigenetic model. We find that both epigenetic resetting and the environmental frequency are crucial parameters in this system. Our results illustrate the regions of parameter space that enable up to three equilibria to be simultaneously locally stable. Furthermore, it is clear that both continued environmental induction and epigenetic resetting prevent epigenetic fixation, maintaining phenotypic variation through different epiallelic states. However, unless both environments are reasonably common, levels of epigenetically-maintained variation are low. We argue that it is vital that non-genomic phenotypic diversity is not ignored in evolutionary theory, but instead regarded as distinct epiallelic variants. Ultimately, a critical goal of future experiments should be to determine accurate rates of epigenetic resetting, especially over several generations, in order to establish the long-term significance of epigenetic inheritance.

Many are also commercially significant, such as cotton fibers and trichomes that secrete pharmaceutically useful or herbivore-deterring compounds. Here, we focus on the phylogeny and evolution of the subgroup 9 R2R3 MYB gene transcription factors, which include the MIXTA gene, and that are important for the specification and regulation of plant cellular differentiation. We have sequenced 49 subgroup 9 R2R3 MYB genes from key experimental taxa and combined these sequences with those identified by an exhaustive bioinformatic search, to compile a data set of 223 subgroup 9 R2R3 MYB genes. Our phylogenetic analyses demonstrate, for the first time, the complex evolutionary history of the subgroup 9 R2R3 MYB genes. A duplication event is inferred before the origin of seed plants giving rise to two major gene lineages, here termed SBG9-A and SBG9-B. The evolutionary conservation of the SBG9-B gene lineage has not been previously recognized and its role in cellular differentiation is unknown, thus an entire clade of potential candidate genes for epidermal cell regulation remains to be explored. Using a heterologous transformation bioassay, we provide functional data that implicate members of the SBG9-B lineage in the specification of epidermal projections. Furthermore, we reveal numerous putative duplication events in both SBG9-A and SBG9-B lineages, resolving uncertainty about orthology and paralogy among the subgroup 9 R2R3 MYB genes. Finally, we provide a robust framework over which to interpret existing functional data and to direct ongoing comparative genetic research into the evolution of plant cellular diversity.

Both their plastid and mitochondrial genomes are extremely reduced in gene number and rearranged into numerous unconventional genomic elements. Transcription processes are also elaborately modified including extensive RNA editing and trans-splicing. Some dinoflagellates have replaced their original plastid through serial endosymbiotic events. Karlodinium veneficum is such an example that now contains a haptophyte plastid. This tertiary plastid provides a case of a more conventional genetic system introduced into a cellular environment with a known penchant for genetic oddities. Here, we show that K. veneficum plastid transcripts undergo extensive substitutional editing. The substitution types are more diverse than those seen in most other plastids but are similar to those of dinoflagellate organelles. There is no evidence for RNA editing of plastid-encoded transcripts from extant haptophytes, suggesting that K. veneficum plastid editing developed after the uptake of the tertiary endosymbiont.

Such rareness may result from a high probability of extinction in dioecious species because of less efficient dispersal and the costs of sexual selection, which are expected to harm dioecious species' survival on the long term. These handicaps should Decemberrease the effective population size (Ne) of dioecious species, which in turn should reduce the efficacy of selection. Moreover, sexual selection in dioecious species is expected to specifically affect some genes, which will evolve under positive selection. The relative contribution of these effects is currently unknown and we tried to disentangle them by comparing sequence evolution between dioecious and non-dioecious species in the Silene genus (Caryophyllaceae), where dioecy has evolved at least twice. For the dioecious species in the section Melandrium, where dioecy is the oldest, we found a global reduction of purifying selection, while on some, male-biased genes, positive selection was found. For section Otites, where dioecy evolved more recently, we found no significant differences between dioecious and non-dioecious species. Our results are consistent with the view that dioecy is an evolutionary dead end in flowering plants, although other scenarios for explaining reduced Ne cannot be ruled out. Our results also show that contrasting forces act on the genomes of dioecious plants, and suggest that some time is required before the genome of such plants bears the footprints of dioecy.

The evolution and diversification of this superfamily have been documented by fossils and comparative morphology, but have not yet been studied from the perspective of molecular phylogeny. This study is the first attempt to reconstruct an extensive phylogeny of Dipodidae and estimate divergence times based on a nuclear gene coding for interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein. We found that there is a wide measure of agreement with the fossil record. Each of the three ecological groups of the extant Dipodoidea (sicistines, zapodines, and jerboas) has its distinctive distribution the distribution patterns have been shaped by the dispersal events. The key events of paleogeographic distribution coincided with major paleoenvironmental events in the Cenozoic. The first important diversification phase occurred during the period from the Oligocene to Early Miocene, when global climate underwent major changes beginning with the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. The second adaptive radiation occurred within jerboas and was associated with the expansion of open habitat starting with the late Middle Miocene. The diversification of jerboas can be correlated with habitat changes in response to global and regional climatic events.

DNA sequence alignment among species using specific software revealed comparative rates of divergence with considerably faster and more heterogeneous substitution rate for control region as compared to cytochrome b and ATPase 6/8. Despite the relatively high variability of control region, the overall levels of sequence divergence were low in coding regions. Two protein coding genes and the control region with varying degree of sequence divergence established two distinct groups which are genetically distant from each other exhibiting identical phylogenetic structure in IMCs. Closest relationship was between Labeo rohita and Catla catla indicating that they might have diverged from a common ancestral stock in genealogical lineage whereas Cirrhinus mrigala showed greater divergence with all the three DNA regions studied. Findings of this study will help to understand evolution of mitochondrial DNA genes in carps and facilitate future investigations on phylogeographic structure of Indian carps. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

How such discrete polyphenisms evolve starting from continuously varying phenotypes has received little theoretical attention. We model the evolution of sigmoid norms of reaction in response to variation in an underlying trait or in a continuous environment to identify conditions for the evolution of discontinuity. For traits with expression depending on a randomly varying underlying factor, such as developmental noise, polyphenism is unstable under constant phenotypic selection for two selective peaks, and reaction norm evolution results in a phenotypic distribution concentrated at only one peak. But with frequency-dependent selection between two adaptive peaks, a steep threshold maintaining polyphenism can evolve. For inducible plastic traits with expression conditioned on an environmental variable that also affects phenotypic selection, the steepness of the evolved reaction norm depends both on the differentiation of the environment in time or space and on its predictability between development and selection. Together with recent measurements of genetic variance of threshold steepness, these predictions suggest that quasi-discrete phenotypic variation may often evolve from continuous norms of reactions rather than being an intrinsic property of development.

Even solitary organisms that do not interact directly with conspecifics may interact indirectly with them through competition for resources. As a result, traits that appear to affect individual fitness alone can also modify the fitness of relatives nearby and thus may evolve partially through these cryptic indirect fitness effects. Here we develop a method to quantitatively Septemberarate direct and indirect fitness consequences when some microbes become dormant, while neighbors of the same genotype remain active. Dormant microbes typically survive stresses that kill metabolically active cells, but dormancy also has a social side effect, sparing resources that may be used by nondormant individuals for growth. In structured populations, spared resources may be preferentially consumed by nondormant clonemates, providing an indirect benefit. Without population structure, however, exploitation by a never-dormant competitor imposes an indirect fitness cost on dormant cells. Cryptic indirect fitness effects may play a significant role in the evolution of many ostensibly asocial traits.

By mapping the genetic changes and their phenotypic effects onto the phylogeny, it is possible to distinguish changes that may have been directly responsible for a new character state from those that fine tune the transition. Here, we use phylogenetic and functional methods to trace the evolution of substrate specificity in dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (Dfr), an anthocyanin pathway gene known to be involved in the transition from blue to red flowers in Iochroma. Ancestral state reconstruction indicates that three substitutions occurred during the flower color transition, whereas several additional substitutions followed the transition. Comparisons of enzymatic function between ancestral proteins in blue- and red-flowered lineages and proteins from present-day taxa demonstrate that evolution of specificity for red pigment precursors was caused by the first three substitutions, which were fixed by positive selection and which differ from previously documented mutations affecting specificity. Two inferred substitutions subsequent to the initial flower color transition were also adaptive and resulted in an additional increase in specificity for red precursors. Epistatic interactions among both sets of substitutions may have limited the order of substitutions along branches of the phylogeny leading from blue-pigmented ancestors to the present-day red-flowered taxa. These results suggest that the species differences in DFR specificity may arise by a combination of selection on flower color and selection for improved pathway efficiency but that the exact series of genetic changes resulting in the evolution of specificity is likely to be highly contingent on the starting state.

Traditionally, Diurodrilidae had been regarded as an annelid family. However, recently Diurodrilidae had been excluded from Annelida and been placed in closer relationship to platyzoan taxa based on both morphological and nuclear rRNA data. Since both, Diurodrilidae and platyzoan taxa, exhibit long branches in the molecular analyses, the close relationship might be due to a long branch attraction artifact. The annelid taxon Myzostomida had been trapped in a similar long branch attraction artifact with platyzoan taxa using nuclear rRNA data, but determination of the nearly complete mitochondrial genome of myzostomids revealed their annelid affinity. Therefore, we determined the nearly complete mitochondrial genome of Diurodrilus subterraneus as well as new nuclear rRNA data for D. subterraneus and some platyzoan taxa. All our analyses of nuclear rRNA and mitochondrial sequence and gene order data presented herein clearly place Diurodrilidae within Annelida and with strong nodal support values in some analyses. Therefore, the previously suggested exclusion of Diurodrilidae from Annelida and its close relationship with platyzoan taxa can be attributed to a long branch artifact. Morphological data do not unambiguously support a platyzoan affinity of Diurodrilidae, but instead would also be in line with a progenetic origin of Diurodrilidae within Annelida.

It provides a suite of statistical tools for selection and prioritization of the amino acid sites that are responsible for the functional divergence of a gene family. The synergistic efforts of DIVERGE and other methods have convincingly demonstrated that the pattern of rate change at a particular amino acid site may contain insightful information about the underlying functional divergence following gene duplication. These predicted sites may be used as candidates for further experiments. We are now releasing an updated version of DIVERGE with the following improvements: 1) a feasible approach to examining functional divergence in nearly complete sequences by including deletions and insertions (indels) 2) the calculation of the false discovery rate of functionally diverging sites 3) estimation of the effective number of functional divergence-related sites that is reliable and insensitive to cutoffs 4) a statistical test for asymmetric functional divergence and 5) a new method to infer functional divergence specific to a given duplicate cluster. In addition, we have made efforts to improve software design and produce a well-written software manual for the general user.

The majority of studies reporting this link, however, have been done on herbivorous insects. It remains unclear if the diversification of angiosperms was also influential in the diversification of species-rich, carnivorous insect groups. Here we investigate the timing of the origin and diversification in the stinging wasps (Hymenoptera: Aculeata). We employ a Bayesian Marchkov chain Monte Carlo relaxed clock approach to estimate divergence times for 13 wasp families and eight superfamilies. Divergence times are calibrated with 12 fossils representing groups in various lineages. Our results indicate that many of the modern aculeate families originated during the Cretaceous and in concert with the diversification of angiosperms. This similarity between diversification ages in wasps and in angiosperms may be due to an increased habitat complexity and prey diversity that early angiosperm forests provided.

This uneven distribution may be owing to differences in diversification rates between clades resulting from processes such as adaptive radiation. We examined the rate and distribution of evolution in feeding biomechanics in the extremely diverse and continentally distributed South American geophagine cichlids. Evolutionary patterns in multivariate functional morphospace were examined using a phylomorphospace approach, disparity-through-time analyses and by comparing Brownian motion (BM) and adaptive peak evolutionary models using maximum likelihood. The most species-rich and functionally disparate clade (CAS) expanded more efficiently in morphospace and evolved more rapidly compared with both BM expectations and its sister clade (GGD). Members of the CAS clade also exhibited an early burst in functional evolution that corresponds to the development of modern ecological roles and may have been related to the colonization of a Novemberel adaptive peak characterized by fast oral jaw mechanics. Furthermore, reduced ecological opportunity following this early burst may have restricted functional evolution in the GGD clade, which is less species-rich and more ecologically specialized. Patterns of evolution in ecologically important functional traits are consistent with a pattern of adaptive radiation within the most diverse clade of Geophagini.

To understand the proximate factors underlying caste determination, it is essential to clarify the developmental mechanisms during the differentiation of each caste. Termite soldiers have species-specific and diverse morphologies that are specialized for colony defense. Soldiers of the subfamily Nasutitermitinae (Termitidae), one of the most derived termite groups, possess a long, horn-like frontal projection (nasus), an invaginated glandular structure in the head (frontal gland), and regressed mandibles. These morphological changes occur prior to the molt into presoldiers (the preceding stage of soldiers). In Drosophila and other insects, Hox genes determine segment identities thus they might be involved in such body-part-specific modifications during soldier differentiation. Deformed (Dfd) functions not only in the formation of the mandible and maxilla but also in other head parts (e.g., eye-antennal disc) in other insects. In this study, we examined Dfd functions in nasus/frontal gland formation and mandibular regression in Nasutitermes takasagoensis. Relative expression analyses showed that Dfd expression levels in the mouthparts were significantly higher than those in any other body parts of workers before presoldier molt. Dfd RNA interference resulted in the inhibition of mandibular regression during presoldier differentiation, but nasus and frontal gland formation were not affected. These results suggest that Dfd is involved in the determination of mandibular positional information and specific modification during presoldier differentiation in N. takasagoensis. This is the first work to show the effects of Hox genes on caste-specific morphogenesis in social insects. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.) 320B: 385-392, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To survey its genetic diversity and trace the history of domestication, we investigated a total of 4938 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments including 2843 previously published and 2095 de Novembero units from 2044 domestic chickens and 51 red Juneglefowl (Gallus gallus). To obtain the highest possible level of molecular resolution, 50 representative samples were further selected for total mtDNA genome sequencing. A fine-gained mtDNA phylogeny was investigated by defining haplogroups A-I and W-Z. Common haplogroups A-G were shared by domestic chickens and red Juneglefowl. Rare haplogroups H-I and W-Z were specific to domestic chickens and red Juneglefowl, respectively. We re-evaluated the global mtDNA profiles of chickens. The geographic distribution for each of major haplogroups was examined. Our results revealed new complexities of history in chicken domestication because in the phylogeny lineages from the red Juneglefowl were mingled with those of the domestic chickens. Several local domestication events in South Asia, Southwest China and Southeast Asia were identified. The assessment of chicken mtDNA data also facilitated our understanding about the Austronesian settlement in the Pacific.

The genetic basis of such unique behaviors in dogs remains poorly understood. We found that genes within regions highly differentiated between outbred Chinese native dogs (CNs) and wolves show high bias for expression localized to brain tissues, particularly the prefrontal cortex, a specific region responsible for complex cognitive behaviors. In contrast, candidate genes showing high population differentiation between CNs and German Shepherd dogs (GSs) did not demonstrate significant expression bias. These observations indicate that these candidate genes highly expressed in the brain have rapidly evolved. This rapid evolution was probably driven by artificial selection during the priMarchy transition from wolves to ancient dogs and was consistent with the evolution of dog-specific characteristics, such as behavior transformation, for thousands of years.

Triggered by environmental cues, populations produce resting eggs that allow them to survive temporally unsuitable conditions. Daphnia magna is a crustacean that reproduces by cyclical parthenogenesis, alternating between the production of asexual offspring and the sexual reproduction of diapausing eggs (ephippia). Prior to ephippia production, males (necessary to ensure ephippia fertilization) are produced parthenogenetically. Both the production of ephippia and the parthenogenetic production of males are induced by environmental factors. Here, we test the hypothesis that the induction of D.magna resting egg production shows a signature of local adaptation. We postulated that Daphnia from permanent ponds would produce fewer ephippia and males than Daphnia from intermittent ponds and that the frequency and season of habitat deterioration would correlate with the timing and amount of male and ephippia production. To test this, we quantified the production of males and ephippia in clonal D.magna populations in several different controlled environments. We found that the production of both ephippia and males varies strongly among populations in a way that suggests local adaptation. By performing quantitative trait locus mapping with parent clones from contrasting pond environments, we identified noNovembererlapping genomic regions associated with male and ephippia production. As the traits are influenced by two different genomic regions, and both are necessary for successful resting egg production, we suggest that the genes for their induction co-evolve.

Analysis of seasonally varying wild-cAugustht flies showed two independent patterns of melanisation: (1) narrow to broad melanic stripes on three anterior abdominal segments only (2) a Novemberel body color pattern (dark vs. light background). We investigated the degree to which these two melanisation systems vary first with latitude and secondly among seasons. There is a shallow latitudinal cline for percent striped melanisation as well as for frequency of body color alleles during the rainy season. The frequencies of body color alleles vary significantly across seasons in the northern populations i.e. the light allele occur abundantly (> 0.94) during the rainy season while the frequency of the dark allele increases (0.22-0.35) during the dry season causing steeper clines during the dry season. By contrast, the low variations in abdominal stripes showed non-significant changes and the cline was similar across seasons. Furthermore, both types of melanisation patterns showed no plasticity with respect to temperature. The present study also investigated clines related to desiccation, heat and cold stress in D. ananassae females across seasons (rainy and dry) from nine latitudinal populations. The clines for stress related traits changes to steeper and non-linear during the dry season. Thus, latitudinal populations of D. ananassae differ in slope values of clines for stress related traits across seasons. This study reports seasonal changes in latitudinal clines of stress resistance traits as seen in a changing frequency of body color alleles of D. ananassae in northern locality, while in southern localities it remains constant. This is presumably the result of only minor seasonal changes in humidity and temperature in the South, whereas in the North seasonal climatic variability is much higher.

Indeed, we estimate that more than a third of the yeast mitochondrial proteome is dual localized. The enzyme fuMarchase is a highly conserved protein in all organisms with respect to its sequence, structure, and enzymatic activity. In eukaryotes, it is dual localized to the cytosol and mitochondria. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the dual localization of fuMarchase is achieved by the reverse translocation mechanism all fuMarchase molecules harbor a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), are targeted to mitochondria, begin their translocation, and are processed by mitochondrial processing peptidase in the matrix. A subset of these processed fuMarchase molecules in transit is then fully imported into the matrix, whereas the majority moves back into the cytosol by reverse translocation. The proposed driving force for fuMarchase distribution is protein folding during import. Here, we asked how reverse translocation could have evolved on a prokaryotic protein that had already acquired expression from the nuclear genome and a targeting sequence. To address this question, we used, as a model, the Escherichia coli FumC Class II fuMarchase, which is homologous to eukaryotic fuMarchases (similar to 58% identity and similar to 74% similarity to the yeast Fum1). Starting with an exclusively mitochondrial targeted FumC (attached to a strong MTS), we show that two randomly acquired mutations within the prokaryotic FumC sequence are sufficient to cause substantial dual targeting by reverse translocation. In fact, the unmutated MTS-FumC also has some ability to be dual targeted but only at low temperatures. Our results suggest that in this case, evolution of dual targeting by reverse translocation is based on naturally occurring and fortuitously conserved features of fuMarchase folding.

Species richness in these islands has been attributed to unique colonization events. The Hawaiian mints comprising of three endemic genera represent one of the largest radiations in the island. Previous studies have shown the Hawaiian mints to be nested within the dry-fruited Stachys, probably resulting from one or more hybridization events. Stachydeae, the largest tribe in the subfamily Lamioideae (Lamiaceae), is a taxonomically complex and widespread lineage exhibiting reMarchkable chromosomal diversity. In this paper we attempted at untangling the relationships between the New World and Hawaiian mint taxa, as well as investigate the origin and diversification of the mints in the New World. There seem to have been at least two independent migration events of Stachys to the New World during the Middle to Late Miocene and towards the beginning of the Pliocene, respectively. Results indicate incongruence between the rDNA and cpDNA phylogenies suggesting a reticulate, New World origin for the Hawaiian mints, although dispersal to Hawaii appears to have happened only once during the Pliocene. South American Stachys diversified from their Mesoamerican relatives around Late Pliocene and may also have arisen from similar reticulate events indicated by their intercalating position among the Mesoamerican Stachys species. Further insights into the phylogenetic relationships between the New World mints may be gathered through the study of low copy nuclear loci. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Genome scans may provide better empirical understanding of the genome-wide patterns of genetic differentiation, especially if the variance due to the previously mentioned factors is partitioned. In North American lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), glacial lineages that diverged in allopatry about 60,000 years ago and came into contact 12,000 years ago have independently evolved in several lakes into two sympatric species pairs (a normal benthic and a dwarf limnetic). Variable degrees of reproductive isolation between species pairs across lakes offer a continuum of genetic and phenotypic divergence associated with adaptation to distinct ecological niches. To disentangle the complex array of genetically based barriers that locally reduce the effective migration rate between whitefish species pairs, we compared genome-wide patterns of divergence across five lakes distributed along this divergence continuum. Using restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, we combined genetic mapping and population genetics approaches to identify genomic regions resistant to introgression and derive empirical measures of the barrier strength as a function of recombination distance. We found that the size of the genomic islands of differentiation was influenced by the joint effects of linkage disequilibrium maintained by selection on many loci, the strength of ecological niche divergence, as well as demographic characteristics unique to each lake. Partial parallelism in divergent genomic regions likely reflected the combined effects of polygenic adaptation from standing variation and independent changes in the genetic architecture of postzygotic isolation. This study illustrates how integrating genetic mapping and population genomics of multiple sympatric species pairs provide a window on the speciation-with-gene-flow mechanism.

Much of this ambiguity stems from lack of anatomical overlap among taxa and the 125-year-long taxonomic confusion surrounding the sauropods Astrodon and Pleurocoelus. New discoveries have begun to remedy the first problem, but a lack of autapomorphies in their holotypes and skeletal associations among their hypodigms renders Astrodon johnstoni, Pleurocoelus altus and Pleurocoelus nanus nomina dubia. Herein I examine the affinities of sauropods from the Trinity Group of Texas and Oklahoma previously referred to as Pleurocoelus' or Astrodon'. Some of this material currently comprises the genera Paluxysaurus and Sauroposeidon from laterally equivalent strata in Texas and Oklahoma, respectively. Although representative individuals of Paluxysaurus are only two-thirds the size of Sauroposeidon, bone histology of Paluxysaurus indicates that the individuals from the type locality were not near adult size. The similar provenance, lack of morphological differences, and shared unique features support referral of Paluxysaurus to Sauroposeidon. Other sauropod remains from the Trinity Group are not referable to Pleurocoelus', Astrodon' or Sauroposeidon. Some of these remains comprise the holotype of Astrophocaudia slAugusthteri gen. et sp. November., a basal titanosauriform diagnosed by a hyposphene-hypantrum system in the caudal vertebrae. A sauropod hind limb previously referred to Pleurocoelus' is instead referable to Cedarosaurus weiskopfae based on shared features of the pes. Cladistic analysis indicates that Astrophocaudia and Sauroposeidon are members of Somphospondyli, whereas Cedarosaurus is a brachiosaurid. The Trinity Group of Texas and laterally equivalent Antlers Formation of Oklahoma exhibit similar dinosaur faunas at the generic and specific levels to the Cloverly Formation of Wyoming. This homogeneity with respect to latitude stands in Marchked contrast to the latitudinal variation in dinosaur communities that developed later in the Cretaceous.

Due to its high environmental and cultural variability, and to the long-term human presence there, the genetic structure of modern EA populations is one of the most complicated puzzles in human diversity worldwide. Similarly, the widespread Afro-Asiatic (AA) linguistic phylum reaches its highest levels of internal differentiation in EA. To disentangle this complex ethno-linguistic pattern, we studied mtDNA variability in 1,671 individuals (452 of which were newly typed) from 30 EA populations and compared our data with those from 40 populations (2970 individuals) from Central and Northern Africa and the Levant, affiliated to the AA phylum. The genetic structure of the studied populations-explored using spatial Principal Component Analysis and Model-based clustering-turned out to be composed of four clusters, each with different geographic distribution and/or linguistic affiliation, and signaling different population events in the history of the region. One cluster is widespread in Ethiopia, where it is associated with different AA-speaking populations, and shows shared ancestry with Semitic-speaking groups from Yemen and Egypt and AA-Chadic-speaking groups from Central Africa. Two clusters included populations from Southern Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. Despite high and recent gene-flow (Bantu, Nilo-Saharan pastoralists), one of them is associated with a more ancient AA-Cushitic stratum. Most North-African and Levantine populations (AA-Berber, AA-Semitic) were grouped in a fourth and more differentiated cluster. We therefore conclude that EA genetic variability, although heavily influenced by migration processes, conserves traces of more ancient strata. Am J Phys Anthropol 150:375-385, 2013.

Here, we report a spiral-plated animal from the early Cambrian of Morocco that is the most primitive pentaradial echinoderm yet discovered. It is intermediate between helicoplacoids (a bizarre group of spiral-bodied echinoderms) and crown-group pentaradiate echinoderms. By filling an important gap, this fossil reveals the common pattern that underpins the body plans of the two major echinoderm clades (pelmatozoans and eleutherozoans), showing that differential growth played an important role in their divergence. It also adds to the striking disparity of Novemberel body plans appearing in the Cambrian explosion.	June 22, 2013Ecological character displacement: glass half full or half empty?

Initially thought to play a central role in community assembly and adaptive radiation, ECD recovered from a 1980s nadir to present-day prominence on the strength of many case studies compiled in several influential reviews. However, we reviewed recent studies and found that only nine of 144 cases are strong examples that have ruled out alternative explanations for an ECD-like pattern. We suggest that the rise in esteem of ECD has outpaced available data and that more complete, rather than simply more, case studies are needed. Recent years have revealed that evolutionary change can be observed as it occurs, opening the door to experimental field studies as a new approach to studying ECD.

For instance, genetic admixture through introgressive hybridization or hybrid speciation is likely to affect the genetic variation and evolvability of phenotypic traits. We studied geographic variation in two beak dimensions and three other phenotypic traits of the Italian sparrow (Passer italiae), a young hybrid species formed through interbreeding between house sparrows (P. domesticus) and Spanish sparrows (P. hispaniolensis). We found that beak morphology was strongly influenced by precipitation regimes and that it appeared to be the target of divergent selection within Italian sparrows. Interestingly, however, the degree of parental genetic contribution in the hybrid species had no effect on phenotypic beak variation. Moreover, beak height divergence may mediate genetic differentiation between populations, consistent with isolation-by-adaptation within this hybrid species. The study illustrates how hybrid species may be relatively unconstrained by their admixed genetic background, allowing them to adapt rapidly to environmental variation.

The pace at which new data and methodologies are generated calls for the use of preexisting, optimized-yet extensible-code, typically distributed as libraries or packages. This motivated the Bio++ project, aiming at developing a set of C++ libraries for sequence analysis, phylogenetics, population genetics, and molecular evolution. The main attractiveness of Bio++ is the extensibility and reusability of its components through its object-oriented design, without compromising the computer-efficiency of the underlying methods. We present here the second major release of the libraries, which provides an extended set of classes and methods. These extensions notably provide built-in access to sequence databases and new data structures for handling and manipulating sequences from the omics era, such as multiple genome alignments and sequencing reads libraries. More complex models of sequence evolution, such as mixture models and generic n-tuples alphabets, are also included.

Both sperm and non-sperm components of the ejaculate (including parasperm, seminal proteins, water, and macromolecules) play vital roles in postcopulatory sexual selection and conflict, processes that can potentially drive rapid evolutionary change and reproductive isolation. Here, we assess the increasing evidence that considering ejaculate composition as a whole (and potential trade-offs among ejaculate components) has important consequences for predictions about male reproductive investment and female responses to ejaculates. We review current theory and empirical work, and detail how social and environmental effects on ejaculate composition have potentially far-reaching fitness consequences for both sexes.

It is largely unknown, however, whether this pattern holds for and what factors affect specialization in Marchine mutualisms. Here we present the first analysis of network specialization (H-2') for Marchine mutualistic networks. Specialization among eight Indo-Pacific networks of obligate mutualistic gobies and shrimps was indistinguishable from that among comparably intimate terrestrial mutualisms (ants-myrmecophytes) and higher than that among nonintimate ones (seed dispersers). Specialization was affected by variability in habitat use for both gobies and shrimps and by phylogenetic history for shrimps. Habitat use was phylogenetically conserved among shrimp, and thus effects of shrimp phylogeny on partner choice were mediated in part by habitat. By contrast, habitat use and pairing patterns in gobies were not related to phylogenetic history. This asymmetry appears to result from evolutionary constraints on partner use in shrimps and convergence among distantly related gobies to utilize burrows provided by multiple shrimp species. Results indicate that the evolution of mutualism is affected by life-history characteristics that transcend environments and that different factors constrain interactions in disparate ecosystems.

However, few opportunities exist to examine whether disease emergence stems from a single successful pathogen transfer, and whether this successful lineage represents only one of several pathogen transfers between hosts. We examined the successful host transfer and subsequent evolution of the bacterial pathogen Mycoplasma galliSeptemberticum, an emergent pathogen of house finches (Haemorhous (formerly Carpodacus) mexicanus). Our principal goals were to assess whether host transfer has been a repeated event between the original poultry hosts and house finches, whether only a single host transfer was ultimately responsible for the emergence of M. galliSeptemberticum in these finches, and whether the spread of the pathogen from east to west across North America has resulted in spatial structuring in the pathogen. Using a phylogeny of M. galliSeptemberticum based on 107 isolates from domestic poultry, house finches and other songbirds, we infer that the bacterium has repeatedly jumped between these two groups of hosts but with only a single lineage of M. galliSeptemberticum persisting and evolving in house finches bacterial evolution has produced monophyletic eastern and western North American subclades.

Among other factors, ECMs implicitly model the influence of amino acid properties and multiple nucleotide substitutions (MNS). However, the estimation of ECMs requires large quantities of data, and until recently, only few suitable data sets were available. Here, we take advantage of several new Drosophila species genomes to estimate codon models from genome-wide data. The availability of large numbers of genomes over varying phylogenetic depths in the Drosophila genus allows us to explore various divergence levels. In consequence, we can use these data to determine the appropriate level of divergence for the estimation of ECMs, avoiding overestimation of MNS rates caused by saturation. To account for variation in evolutionary rates along the genome, we develop new empirical codon hidden Marchkov models (ecHMMs). These models significantly outperform previous ones with respect to maximum likelihood values, suggesting that they provide a better fit to the evolutionary process. Using ECMs and ecHMMs derived from genome-wide data sets, we devise new likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) of positive selection. We found classical LRTs very sensitive to the presence of MNSs, showing high false-positive rates, especially with small phylogenies. The new LRTs are more conservative than the classical ones, having acceptable false-positive rates and reduced power.

However, maternal thermoregulation is also a critical component of reproduction in oviparous squamates, for which considerable embryonic development occurs prior to oviposition. When carrying eggs, oviparous mothers modify thermoregulation in a manner similar to that of pregnant females. To further understand the role of temperature in influencing reproductive strategies, it is critical that we elucidate the degree to which thermal sensitivity varies across developmental stages. We studied stage-dependent embryonic sensitivity in a viviparous snake, the aspic viper (Vipera aspis). We manipulated female body temperature at different stages of pregnancy-early development, early embryonic growth, and late embryonic growth-by imposing two contrasting daily thermal cycles that mimicked reproductive (warm) and nonreproductive (cool) female temperature profiles. Thermal sensitivity of offspring phenotype was stage dependent, with offspring quality more negatively affected when exposure to cool temperatures occurred early in development. In contrast, developmental rate was slowed by the cooler cycle, independent of the timing of the exposure. Given the more persistent effect on phenology, phenological effects likely provide a greater driving force for complete embryonic retention (i.e., viviparity).

Using breeding data collected over 13 years at the King Khalid Wildlife Research Centre (KKWRC) in Saudi Arabia, we tested the hypothesis that larger sand gazelle (Gazella Marchica) offspring will have lower mortality than smaller-sized offspring nonetheless, selection should still favour the production of larger litters (even at the cost of reduced offspring size) under favourable environmental conditions (and vice versa under poor environmental conditions). The present study provides evidence for an early fitness advantage of larger over smaller sand gazelles because offspring that were heavier at birth had higher survival rates to weaning age (90days) and sexual maturity (365days) than lighter offspring also, females had higher survival rates than males. Moreover, antagonistic selection on offspring and litter size is resolved in favour of maternal fitness early in the year (i.e. high propensity for twinning), although fitness optima converge later in the year when it becomes beneficial to both offspring and mothers to produce large singletons, highlighting temporal variation in the selective regimes affecting female reproductive life histories.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 116-127.

Here, we jointly analyze population genomic and comparative genomic data to search for functional processes showing relaxed negative selection specifically in the human lineage, whereas remaining evolutionarily conserved in other mammals. Consistent with previous studies, we find that olfactory receptor genes display such a signature of relaxation in humans. Intriguingly, proteasome genes also show a prominent signal of human-specific relaxation: multiple proteasome subunits, including four members of the catalytic core particle, contain high frequency nonsynonymous polymorphisms at sites conserved across mammals. Chimpanzee proteasome genes do not display a similar trend. Human proteasome genes also bear no evidence of recent positive or balancing selection. These results suggest human-specific relaxation of negative selection in proteasome subunits the exact biological causes, however, remain unknown.

The subsequent Decemberay of such traits highlights the importance of natural selection for adaptations, yet its causes have rarely been investigated. To study the fate of formerly adaptive traits after lifestyle changes, we evaluated sexual traits in five independently derived asexual lineages, including traits that are specific to males and therefore not exposed to selection. At least four of the asexual lineages retained the capacity to produce males that display normal courtship behaviours and are able to fertilize eggs of females from related sexual species. The maintenance of male traits may stem from pleiotropy, or from these traits only regressing via drift, which may require millions of years to generate phenotypic effects. By contrast, we found parallel Decemberay of sexual traits in females. Asexual females produced altered airborne and contact signals, had modified sperm storage organs, and lost the ability to fertilize their eggs, impeding reversals to sexual reproduction. Female sexual traits were Decemberayed even in recently derived asexuals, suggesting that trait changes following the evolution of asexuality, when they occur, proceed rapidly and are driven by selective processes rather than drift.

Spalax is safeguarded all of its life underground from aboveground climatic fluctuations and predators. However, it encounters multiple stresses in its underground burrows including darkness, energetics, hypoxia, hypercapnia, food scarcity, and pathogenicity. Consequently, it evolved adaptive genomic, proteomic, and phenomic complexes to cope with those stresses. Here I describe some of these adaptive complexes, and their theoretical and applied perspectives. Spalax mosaic molecular and organismal evolution involves reductions or regressions coupled with expansions or progressions caused by evolutionary tinkering and natural genetic engineering. Speciation of Spalax in Israel occurred in the Pleistocene, during the last 2.00-2.35 Mya, generating four species associated intimately with four climatic regimes with increasing aridity stress southwards and eastwards representing an ecological speciational adaptive trend: (Spalax golani, 2n = 54 --> S. galili, 2n = 52 --> S. carmeli, 2n = 58 --> S. judaei, 2n = 60). Darwinian ecological speciation occurred gradually with relatively little genetic change by Robertsonian chromosomal and genic mutations. Spalax genome sequencing has just been completed. It involves multiple adaptive complexes to life underground and is an evolutionary model to a few hundred underground mammals. It involves great promise in the future for medicine, space flight, and deep-sea diving. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This study incorporated phylogenetics and ecological niche models (ENM) to examine whether congeneric species of Callogorgia (Octoberocorallia: Primnoidae) occupy different ecological niches across the continental slope of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and whether this niche divergence could be important in the evolution of these closely related species. Callogorgia americana americana, Callogorgia americana delta and Callogorgia gracilis were documented at 13 sites in the GoM (250-1000 m) from specimen collections and extensive video observations. On a first order, these species were Septemberarated by depth, with C. gracilis occurring at the shallowest sites, C. a. americana at mid-depths and C. a. delta at the deepest sites. Callogorgia a. delta was associated with areas of increased seep activity, whereas C. gracilis and C. a. americana were associated with narrow, yet warmer, temperature ranges and did not occur near cold seeps. ENM background and identity tests revealed little to no overlap in ecological niches between species. Temporal calibration of the phylogeny revealed the formation of the Isthmus of Panama was a vicariance event that may explain some of the patterns of speciation within this genus. These results elucidate the potential mechanisms for speciation in the deep sea, emphasizing both bathymetric speciation and vicariance events in the evolution of a genus across multiple regions.

Previous phylogenetic studies suggested that one of the main groups of Eremiadinae (the Ethiopian clade) consist of two clades with predominately East-African and South-African distribution. Yet, especially the latter one, which includes the genera Pedioplanis, Meroles, Ichnotropis, Tropidosaura and Australolacerta, was not well supported in the molecular phylogenetic analysis. In this study, we analysed the phylogenetic relationships among the genera of the South African clade' to assess whether this group actually forms a highly supported clade and to address questions concerning the monophyly of the genera. We sequenced sections of the widely used mitochondrial genes coding for 16S rRNA, 12S rRNA and cytochrome b (altogether 2045bp) as well as the nuclear genes c-mos, RAG-1, PRLR, KIF24, EXPH5 and RAG-2 (altogether 4473bp). The combined data set increased the support values for several nodes considerably. Yet, the relationships among five major lineages within the South African clade' are not clearly resolved even with this large data set. We interpret this as a hard polytomy' due to fast radiation within the South African lacertids. The combined tree based on nine Marchker genes provides strong support for the South African Clade' and its sister group relationship with the East African Clade'. Our results confirm the genus Tropidosaura as a monophylum, while Ichnotropis is paraphyletic in our trees: Ichnotropis squamulosa appears more closely related to Meroles than to Ichnotropis capensis. Furthermore, the monophyly of Meroles is questionable as well. Based on our results, I.squamulosa should be transferred from Ichnotropis into the genus Meroles. Also, the two species of Australolacerta (A.australis and A.rupicola) are very distantly related and the genus is perhaps paraphyletic, too. Finally we propose a phylogeographical scenario in the context of palaeoclimatic data and compare it with a previously postulated hypothesis.

Hand.-Mazz. is an important Chinese herb in treating cerebral infarction and heart diseases, which is increasingly endangered because of over-harvesting and habitat fragmentation. We applied AFLP method to investigate its genetic diversity and population structure in order to make efficient conservation strategies. The results indicated a relatively low intraspecific genetic diversity and feeble genetic differentiation among populations, and no Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) was detected. The relationships between population genetic diversity and populations' distributions (latitude, longitude and altitude) were tested, and the genetic diversity of each population (H-POP) positively correlated with the populations' distribution altitudes. The suitable germinating and growing conditions and less human disturbance at the higher latitude regions might be attributable for this phenomenon. For conservation purpose, an ex situ conservation measure for the populations of E. breviscapus with large size in higher altitude regions should be conserved in priority. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, on the other hand, is a facultative intracellular pathogen. These two prokaryotic species can be considered related phylogenetically, and they share a large amount of their genetic material, which is commonly termed the core genome. Despite their shared core genome, both species display very different lifestyles, and it is unclear to what extent the core genome, apart from the species-specific genes, plays a role in this lifestyle divergence. In this study, we focus on the differences in expression domains for the orthologous genes in E. coli and S. Typhimurium. The iterative comparison of coexpression methodology was used on large expression compendia of both species to uncover the conservation and divergence of gene expression. We found that gene expression conservation occurs mostly independently from amino acid similarity. According to our estimates, at least more than one quarter of the orthologous genes has a different expression domain in E. coli than in S. Typhimurium. Genes involved with key cellular processes are most likely to have conserved their expression domains, whereas genes showing diverged expression are associated with metabolic processes that, although present in both species, are regulated differently. The expression domains of the shared core genome of E. coli and S. Typhimurium, consisting of highly conserved orthologs, have been tuned to help accommodate the differences in lifestyle and the pathogenic potential of Salmonella.

Genetic datasets can be used to provide robust estimates of this important parameter. However, the methods used to obtain these estimates assume that generations are discrete. We used simulated data to assess the influences of overlapping generations on the estimates of effective size provided by the linkage disequilibrium (LD) method. Our simulations focus on two factors: the degree of reproductive skew exhibited by the focal species and the generation time, without considering sample size or the level of polymorphism at Marchker loci. In situations where a majority of reproduction is achieved by a small fraction of the population, the effective number of breeders can be much smaller than the per-generation effective population size. The LD in samples of newborns can provide estimates of the former size, while our results indicate that the latter size is best estimated using random samples of reproductively mature adults. Using samples of adults, the downwards bias was less than approximately 15% across our simulated life histories. As noted in previous assessments, precision of the estimate depends on the magnitude of effective size itself, with greater precision achieved for small populations.

Evidence suggests that sexual selection is highly complex in nature, often acting on multivariate sexual characters that sometimes include non-heritable components of variation, thus presenting a challenge for predicting patterns of sexual trait evolution. Laupala crickets have undergone an explosive species radiation Marchked by divergence in male courtship song and associated female preferences, yet patterns of sexual selection that might explain this diversification remain unknown. We used female phonotaxis trials to estimate the fitness surface for acoustic characters within one population of Laupala cerasina, a species with Marchked geographical variation in male song and female preferences. Results suggested significant directional sexual selection on three major song traits, while canonical rotation of the matrix of nonlinear selection coefficients (gamma) revealed the presence of significant convex (stabilizing) sexual selection along combinations of characters. Analysis of song variation within and among males indicated significantly higher repeatability along the canonical axis of greatest stabilizing selection than along the axis of greatest linear selection. These results are largely consistent with patterns of song divergence that characterize speciation and suggest that different song characters have the potential to indicate distinct information to females during courtship.

Although A-eggs are viable, they almost never produce fledged chicks (genus average <1%). Using classical life-history theory and phylogenetic comparative methods, we demonstrate a Marchked slow-down in the life history of Eudyptes: age of first reproduction is 52% later and annual fecundity 48% lower compared with other two-egg clutch penguin species. All six Eudyptes species have retained a two-egg clutch, despite this pronounced life-history slow-down this suggests evolutionary mismatch between clutch size and chicks fledged per clutch. Consistent with this, we show that Eudyptes fledge 43% fewer chicks per clutch than other two-egg clutch penguin species. Extreme intraclutch ESD in Eudyptes is associated priMarchily with a uniform (5%) increase in relative B-egg size, and B-egg size has evolved in accord with life history. We further show that intraclutch ESD is positively correlated with age of first reproduction in Eudyptes but not in other two-egg clutch penguin species. We argue that Eudyptes' persistent failure to evolve a one-egg clutch constitutes a unique genus-wide evolutionary maladaptation and that extreme intraclutch ESD evolved as a correlated response to selection favoring a slower life history imposed by their extreme pelagic overwintering and migration ecology.

Populations with different flowering times exist, correlated with differences in a number of morphological characters. The present study evaluates the correlation of morphological characters and genetic differentiation of populations of Rhinanthus alectorolophus. Thirty-nine populations of three different subspecies from southwestern Germany were sampled. A total of 798 individuals were used for morphological analyses and 187 of these for AFLP analyses. Principal component analysis showed that morphological variation is mostly continuous. In a discriminant analysis based on morphological characters, only 89.7 % of all individuals were correctly assigned to their previously determined subspecies, indicating that subspecies identification is ambiguous for some populations. Using AFLP data and Bayesian assignment analysis, the sampled individuals could be grouped in three genetic clusters which do not correspond to the three subspecies. Instead, the clustering shows a clear geographic pattern and a Mantel test likewise revealed a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances. Correlations of genetic distances with differences in morphological characters were weak and mostly insignificant. The results indicate that the subspecies of R. alectorolophus do not form discrete entities and that the character combinations distinguishing them are homoplastic.

Hence, a cost-saving soldier production strategy is expected to be favored. Here, we hypothesize that, to save the cost, a eusocial aphid Ceratovacuna japonica produces soldiers with smaller weapon in the season when predators are not abundant. The abundance of two specialist lepidopteran predators (i.e., Taraka hamada and Atkinsonia ignipicta) of C. japonica dramatically increased, and aphid colony size significantly Decemberreased, from Julyy to Augustust. In line with these, the soldiers in Augustust had larger weapons (i.e., frontal horns) than those in Junee, indicating a correlational increase in weapon size with predation pressure. We predict that a reliable prospective signal indicating the coming of midsummer (environmental temperature) induces mother aphids to produce soldiers with larger weapons. Experiments clarified that soldiers produced at 20 A degrees C (typical temperature of Julyy to Augustust) had larger weapons than those produced at 15 A degrees C (typical temperature of May to Julyy). Such phenotypic plasticity appears to be adaptive to maximize the fitness of C. japonica under a temporally variable but predictable predation environment. These results indicate that C. japonica aphids not merely have distinctive reproductive-and soldier castes, but also produce differentially armed soldiers in a habitat with temporally changing predation risks.

In the nOctoberuid moth Heliothis subflexa, one group of sex pheromone components, the acetates, emitted by the female, plays a crucial isolating role in preventing interspecific matings to males of the closely related Heliothis virescens, in which females do not produce acetates and males are repelled by them. We previously found intraspecific variation in acetates in H. subflexa: females in eastern North America contain significantly more acetates than females in Western Mexico. Here we describe the persistence of this intraspecific variation in laboratory-reared strains and the identification of one major quantitative trait locus (QTL), explaining 40% of the variance in acetate amounts. We homologized this intraspecific QTL to our previously identified interspecific QTL using restriction-associated DNA (RAD) tags. We found that a major intraspecific QTL overlaps with one of the two major interspecific QTL. To identify candidate genes underlying the acetate variation, we investigated a number of gene families with known or suspected acetyl- or acyltransferase activity. The most likely candidate genes did not map to our QTL, so that we currently hypothesize that a transcription factor underlies this QTL. Finding a single, large QTL that impacts variation in pheromone blends between and within species is, to our knowledge, the first such example for traits that have been demonstrated to affect premating isolation.

While comparative analyses focus on ultimate causes of this phenomenon, few attempts have been made to quantify its ontogenetic basis. Here we deal with the latter issue using the skeletochronology-based demographic data gathered from the literature for anurans, a group of indeterminately growing vertebrates typically exhibit female-biased SSD. Both non- and phylogenetically corrected analyses showed (1) SSD was correlated positively with the sex difference in adult mean age but negatively with the corresponding difference in annual growth rate, (2) the sex difference in adult mean age tended to be negatively correlated with that in growth rate, and (3) the sex difference in adult mean age was positively correlated with that in age at maturity. We conclude that in anuran lineages, the degree of SSD bias towards females is mediated by sexual bimaturation: females mature later than males, and thus live longer and attain larger despite growing slower. Stronger fecundity selection benefits to females, despite incurring growth cost, in combination with the benefits to males from increased reproductive opportunities resulting from earlier maturity, should be the priMarchy evolutionary drivers of the typically female-biased SSD.

Butterfly eyespots offer a fertile subfield for such investigations. Previous explanations for the origin of eyespots are reviewed, and a new hypothesis is presented. According to this new Recursion Model, eyespots are ectopic versions of the wing Marchgin. Evidence for this equivalence includes: (1) secretion of the morphogen Wingless, (2) expression of the homeobox gene Distal-less, and (3) specification of outlying contours that take the form of stripes or rings. These three steps constitute a modular program that was initially executed only at the Marchgin. The model proposes that eyespots were created when the program was accidentally rebooted (recursively) at certain points in the wing blade by a fortuitous mutation that occurred at the dawn of the Nymphalid family. Those points are located wherever two interacting genes are expressed. Gene A is expressed midway between adjacent wing veins, while gene B is expressed at a certain distance from the wing Marchgin. The mutation is thought to have installed a new cis-enhancer at the wingless gene locus, which was uniquely responsive to the combination of A and B inputs. Because the postulated enhancer should be easy to pinpoint by transgenic in vivo assays of reporter constructs, this new model is directly testable. If it proves correct, then eyespots would become one of only a few putative cases where a Novemberel feature arose suddenly.

However, substitutions at neighboring sites may co-occur as multinucleotide replacement events (MNRs). Here, we compare noncoding sequences of several species of primates, and of three species of Drosophila fruit flies, in a phylogenetic analysis of the replacements that occurred between species at nearby nucleotide sites. Both in primates and in Drosophila, the frequency of single-nucleotide replacements is substantially elevated within 10 nucleotides from other replacements that occurred on the same lineage but not on another lineage. The data imply that dinucleotide replacements (DNRs) affecting sites at distances of up to 10 nucleotides from each other are responsible for 2.3% of single-nucleotide replacements in primate genomes and for 5.6% in Drosophila genomes. Among these DNRs, 26% and 69%, respectively, are in fact parts of replacements of three or more trinucleotide replacements (TNRs). The plurality of MNRs affect nearby nucleotides, so that at least six times as many DNRs affect two adjacent nucleotide sites than sites 10 nucleotides apart. Still, approximately 60% of DNRs, and approximately 90% of TNRs, span distances more than two (or three) nucleotides. MNRs make a major contribution to the observed clustering of substitutions: In the human-chimpanzee comparison, DNRs are responsible for 50% of cases when two nearby replacements are observed on the human lineage, and TNRs are responsible for 83% of cases when three replacements at three immediately adjacent sites are observed on the human lineage. The prevalence of MNRs matches that is observed in data on de Novembero mutations and is also observed in the regions with the lowest sequence conservation, suggesting that MNRs mainly have mutational origin however, epistatic selection and/or gene conversion may also play a role.

In this study, we used multiple common gardens to examine the evolutionary significance of latitudinal variation in phenology of a widespread invasive species, the Asian short-day flowering annual grass Microstegium vimineum. In environmentally controlled growth chambers, we grew plants from seeds collected from multiple latitudes across the species' invasive range. Flowering time and biomass were both strongly correlated with the latitude of population origin such that populations collected from more northern latitudes flowered significantly earlier and at lower biomass than populations from southern locations. We suggest that this pattern may be the result of rapid adaptive evolution of phenology over a period of less than one hundred years and that such changes have likely promoted the northward range expansion of this species. We note that possible barriers to gene flow, including bottlenecks and inbreeding, have apparently not forestalled evolutionary processes for this plant. Furthermore, we hypothesize that evolution of phenology may be a widespread and potentially essential process during range expansion for many invasive plant species.

Thus, one might expect species that are highly toxic or venomous (i.e. chemically protected) will have longer lifespans than related species that are not likewise protected. This reMarchkable relationship has been suggested to occur in amphibians and snakes. First, we show that chemical protection is highly conserved in several lineages of amphibians and snakes. Therefore, accounting for phylogenetic autocorrelation is critical when conservatively testing evolutionary hypotheses because species may possess similar longevities and defensive attributes simply through shared ancestry. Herein, we compare maximum longevity of chemically protected and nonprotected species, controlling for potential nonindependence of traits among species using recently available phylogenies. Our analyses confirm that longevity is positively correlated with body size in both groups which is consistent with life-history theory. We also show that maximum lifespan was positively associated with chemical protection in amphibian species but not in snakes. Chemical protection is defensive in amphibians, but priMarchily offensive (involved in prey capture) in snakes. Thus, we find that although chemical defence in amphibians favours long life, there is no evidence that chemical offence in snakes does the same.

Although these costs are thought to be male specific, traits that have a negative effect due to exaggeration are often shared between the sexes as life-history traits. When there are genetic intersexual correlations for these shared characters, the evolution of the exaggerated traits can impose these costs on nonadorned females through the intersexual correlation. Thus, the exaggerated traits can constrain optimum development of female characters, even if the females lack these exaggerations completely. However, investigation of this pattern has been largely ignored, and thus, it is necessary to investigate genetic architectures of these traits within and across the sexes. Male flour beetles, Gnatocerus cornutus, have enlarged mandibles that are used in male-male competition, but females lack this character completely. Using a traditional full-sib/half-sib breeding design, we detected a negative intrasexual genetic correlation between male weapon size and locomotor activity, but not an intersexual genetic correlation for locomotor activity. After subjecting this weapon to 17 generations of bidirectional selection, we found a correlated response to locomotor activity in the male, whereas there was no correlated response in the female. Our results suggest that the costs of exaggerated traits to locomotion are not imposed on females and would be male specific. This is partly explained by genetic Decemberoupling of locomotor activities across the sexes.

Here, we present a model which argues that the body sizes of Nearctic mammals were moulded by Cenozoic climate and vegetation changes. Following the early Eocene Climate Optimum, forests retreated and gave way to open woodland and savannah landscapes, followed later by grasslands. Many herbivores that radiated in these new landscapes underwent a switch from browsing to grazing associated with increased unguligrade cursoriality and body size, the latter driven by the energetics and constraints of cellulose digestion (fermentation). Carnivores also increased in size and digitigrade, cursorial capacity to occupy a size distribution allowing the capture of prey of the widest range of body sizes. With the emergence of larger, faster carnivores, plantigrade mammals were constrained from evolving to large body sizes and most remained smaller than 1kg throughout the middle Cenozoic. We find no consistent support for either Cope's Rule or Bergmann's Rule in plantigrade mammals, the largest locomotor guild (n=1186, 59% of species in the database). Some cold-specialist plantigrade mammals, such as beavers and Marchmots, showed dramatic increases in body mass following the Miocene Climate Optimum which may, however, be partially explained by Bergmann's rule. This study reemphasizes the necessity of considering the evolutionary history and resultant form and function of mammalian morphotypes when attempting to understand contemporary mammalian body size distributions.

Here, we investigated the evolutionary history of swallowtail butterflies of the Papilio subgenus Achillides, comprising up to 25 recognized species and about 100 subspecies distributed across the Indo-Australian Archipelago. To estimate the relative contributions of factors influencing their biodiversity, we used DNA sequences to infer the phylogeny and species limits of 22 species including most of their subspecies. We recovered a highly resolved and well-supported phylogeny for the subgenus, and clarified some taxonomic ambiguities at the species level. The corresponding DNA-based species phylogeny was then employed to reconstruct their historical biogeography using relaxed-clock and parametric-based analyses. Molecular dating and biogeographical analyses showed that Achillides originated around 19 Ma in Sunda + Wallacea. Biogeographical reconstructions indicated that geological vicariance shaped the early evolutionary history of Achillides whereas dispersal influenced late diversification. Birthdeath likelihood analyses allowed exploration of their tempo and mode of diversification. We detected several shifts in diversification rates that are attributable to past climate-induced biogeographical events. By assessing both regional and fine-scale biodiversity patterns, this study brings new findings to a biogeographical understanding of the Indo-Australian Archipelago.

In Aprilil 2011, a strong heat wave struck extensive geographical areas of the world, including Western Europe. At that time, we happened to resume and extend a long-term time series of seasonal genetic data in the widespread fly Drosophila subobscura, which provided a unique opportunity to quantify the intensity of the genetic perturbation caused by the heat wave. We show that the spring 2011 genetic constitution of the populations transiently shifted to summer-like frequencies, and that the magnitude of the genetic anomaly quantitatively matched the temperature anomaly. The results provide compelling evidence that direct effects of rising temperature are driving adaptive evolutionary shifts, and also suggest a strong genetic resilience in this species.

These leaf beetles have acquired a specialized pocket to store the flagellum in the abdominal cavity, at the same time allowing a quick control of movements of this structure during copulation. We investigated the morphogenesis of the intromittent organs of species with and without a flagellum to discuss the evolutionary background of parallel evolution of Novemberel structures. We found that the specialized pocket is formed by the invagination of an epidermal layer and a resultant rotation of the priMarchy gonopore. Invagination itself is a well-known phenomenon in morphogenetic processes, which leads us to hypothesize that the Novemberelty is formed by co-opting a previously acquired genetic system. A large open-space is present within the intromittent organ during the entire morphogenesis in species without a flagellum, and the invagination in the species with a flagellum grows in the corresponding area. This means that there are no physical impediments for the growth of a large pocket. In addition the sites of muscular attachments in the species with a flagellum are also different from those without it. The differentiation of muscles is completed immediately before adult emergence, which means the muscles are adjustable during the entire morphogenesis in this group. Simple modifications probably based on a co-option of previously acquired genetic systems, the potential space for adding a new element, and an adjustable factor in morphogenesis of the intromittent organ facilitate the parallel evolution of the extreme elongation.

Species of the D. melanogaster subgroup, and other Drosophila species, exhibit a negative correlation between eye size and face width (FW) for example, D. mauritiana generally has bigger eyes composed of larger ommatidia and conversely a narrower face than its sibling species. To better understand the evolution of eye and head morphology, we investigated the genetic and developmental basis of differences in eye size and FW between male D. mauritiana and D. simulans. QTL mapping of eye size and FW showed that the major loci responsible for the interspecific variation in these traits are localized to different genomic regions. Introgression of the largest effect QTL underlying the difference in eye size resulted in flies with larger eyes but no significant difference in FW. Moreover, introgression of a QTL region on the third chromosome that contributes to the FW difference between these species affected FW, but not eye size. We also observed that this difference in FW is detectable earlier in the development of the eye-antennal disc than the difference in the size of the retinal field. Our results suggest that different loci that act at different developmental stages underlie changes in eye size and FW. Therefore, while there is a negative correlation between these traits in Drosophila, we show genetically that they also have the potential to evolve independently and this may help to explain the evolution of these traits in other insects.

Here, we propose that familiarity modulates behaviour to different extents depending on the social context of the interaction. Specifically, the more that one player stands to gain relative to the other, the less important familiarity will be in influencing their responses to one another. We test this prediction using pairs of male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in three competitive scenarios of increasing asymmetry in outcome to the two players: schooling under potential threat (similar outcomes), competing for a defensible food source (some asymmetry) and competing for a receptive female (strongly asymmetrical outcomes). Males show a graded response as asymmetry increases, with familiarity producing Marchked behavioural differences under potential threat, minor changes when competing for food, but none at all in competition for mating opportunities. This suggests that mutualistic benefits can arise as a by-product of selfish behaviour, supporting the role of pseudo-reciprocity in the evolution of cooperation.

Molecular Marchkers applied thus far have not been particularly useful for resolving relationships at the family level. Previous morphological studies have depended heavily on characters of wing venation and articulation which are believed to display considerable degrees of homoplasy due to adaptations to different flight modes. Here, we present a comprehensive anatomical dataset of the head morphology of Anisoptera focusing on muscle organization and endoskeletal features covering nearly all families. The characters are illustrated in detail and incorporated into an updated morphological character matrix covering all parts of the dragonfly body. Phylogenetic analysis recovers all families as monophyletic clades except Corduliidae, Gomphidae as sister group to all remaining Anisoptera, and Austropetaliidae as sister group to Aeshnidae (=Aeshnoidea). The position of Petaluridae and Aeshnoidea to each other could not be resolved. Libelluloidea is monophyletic with Neopetalia and Cordulegastridae as first splits. Chlorogomphidae is sister to monophyletic [Synthemistidae+(Corduliidae'+Libellulidae)]. In addition, we applied a recently published formal approach to detect concerted convergence in morphological data matrices and uncover possible homoplasies. Analyses show that especially head and thorax characters may harbour homoplasies. After exclusion of possible homoplastic characters, Gomphidae is corroborated as sister group to all remaining Anisoptera.

The geometry and arrangement of the barbs, together with the keratin and pigments deposited in the feathers, determine the mechanical stability of the vane, and its stiffness and resistance to abrasive agents. In colour-polymorphic species, individuals display alternative colour morphs, which can be associated with different foraging strategies. Each morph may therefore require specific flying abilities, and their feathers may be exposed to different abrasive agents. Feathers of differently coloured individuals may thus have a specific structure, and colour pigments may help resist abrasive agents and improve stiffness. We examined these predictions in the barn owl (Tyto alba), a species for which the ventral body side varies from white to dark reddish pheomelanic, and in the number and size of black spots located at the tip of the feathers. White and reddish birds show different foraging strategies, and the size of black feather spots is associated with several phenotypic attributes. We found that birds displaying a darker reddish coloration on the ventral body side deposit more melanin pigments in their remiges, which also have fewer barbs. This suggests that wear resistance increases with darkness, whereas feathers of lighter coloured birds may bend less easily. Accordingly, individuals displaying a lighter reddish coloration on the ventral body side, and those displaying larger black spots, displayed more black transverse bars on their remiges: as larger-spotted individuals are heavier and longer-winged birds also have more transverse bars, these bars may reduce feather bending when flying. We conclude that differently coloured individuals produce wing feathers of different strengths to adopt alternative behavioural and life history strategies.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 562-573.

In this study, we reconstruct the origin of metazoan filopodia and microvilli. We first report on the evolutionary assembly of the filopodial molecular toolkit and show that homologs of many metazoan filopodial components, including fascin and myosin X, were already present in the unicellular or colonial progenitors of metazoans. Furthermore, we find that the actin crosslinking protein fascin localizes to filopodia-like structures and microvilli in the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta. In addition, homologs of filopodial genes in the holozoan Capsaspora owczarzaki are upregulated in filopodia-bearing cells relative to those that lack them. Therefore, our findings suggest that proteins essential for metazoan filopodia and microvilli are functionally conserved in unicellular and colonial holozoans and that the last common ancestor of metazoans bore a complex and specific filopodial machinery.

Euteleosts synthesize ZP proteins in the liver, while elopomorphs synthesize them in the ovaries. In Cypriniformes, zp genes are expressed in the ovaries. We investigated the zp genes of two Otocephalan orders: Clupeiformes (Pacific herring and Japanese anchovy) and Gonorynchiformes (milkfish), which diverged earlier than Cypriniformes. cDNA cloning of zp gene homologs revealed that Pacific herring and Japanese anchovy possessed both ovary- and liver-expressed zp genes however, the zp genes of milkfish were only expressed in the ovaries. Molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that ovary- and liver-expressed zpc genes of two the Clupeiformes formed independent clades. Based on this, we hypothesized the evolution of teleostean zp genes, focusing on the organ expressing zp gene. As in other chordates, the original site of expression of zp genes was likely the ovary. In the early stage of teleostean evolution, the ancestral zp genes acquired the ability to express in the liver. Later, one of the two expression sites became dominant. The liver-expressed zp genes are component proteins of the egg envelope in the Euteleostei. In Otocephala, Clupeiformes possess both ovary- and liver-expressed genes that presumably participate in egg envelope formation, whereas the Gonorynchiformes and Cypriniformes have priMarchily preserved ovary expressed zp genes.

To determine if these features corroborate the phylogenetic segregation of the section Ochopodium from Aeschynomene, this study used comparative analysis between Aeschynomene falcata and A. sensitiva, which are within the sections Ochopodium and Aeschynomene, respectively. Flower buds were analysed by use of scanning electron microscopy. Aeschynomene falcata has a unidirectional initiation of Septemberals from the abaxial side, and a tendency toward whorled initiation for petals and stamens. At maturity, it has a calyx tube with five lobes, a pubescent standard petal, keel petals with coherent (but not fused) Marchgins above and below the stamens, and a carpel with a long hairy stipe. Aeschynomene sensitiva has a distinct initiation pattern of petals (1st abaxial, 2nd adaxial, and 3rd lateral) and a tendency toward whorled initiation of Septemberals and stamens. Overlap between Septemberals, petals, and anteSeptemberalous stamens initiation was observed. At maturity, A. sensitiva has a glabrous bilobed calyx and a glabrous standard petal, keel petals postgenitally fused above the stamens, and a carpel with a short and glabrous stipe. Floral ontogeny and morphology of A. falcata are very similar to those of Machaerium and Dalbergia species so far studied, corroborating the phylogenetic proximity of section Ochopodium to these genera. Important features of the floral ontogeny of A. sensitiva seem to be related to the origin of the bilobed calyx, which is shared with the rest of Aeschynomeninae except section Ochopodium, suggesting they are synapomorphies for those species.

The flow regimes inhabited by cyprinids vary extensively from still flow regimes to riptide flow regimes. To test (i) whether flow-driven swimming performance and relevant morphological differentiation are present among fish species and (ii) whether evolutionary shifts between high-flow and low-flow habitats in cyprinids are associated with evolutionary trade-offs in locomotor performance, we obtained data on both steady and unsteady swimming performance and external body shape for 19 species of cyprinids that typically occur in different flow regimes (still, intermediate and riptide). We also measured the routine energy expenditure (RMR) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and calculated the optimal swimming speed. Our results showed that fish species from riptide groups tend to have a higher critical swimming speed (U-crit), maximum linear velocity (V-max) and fineness ratio (FR) than fish from the other two groups. However, there was no correlation between the reconstructed changes in the steady and unsteady swimming performance of the 19 species. According to the phylogenetically independent contrast (PIC) method, the U-crit was actively correlated with the MMR. These results indicated that selection will favour both higher steady and unsteady swimming performance and a more streamlined body shape in environments with high water velocities. The results suggested that steady swimming performance was more sensitive to the flow regime and that for this reason, changes in body shape resulted more from selective pressure on steady swimming performance than on unsteady swimming performance. No evolutionary trade-off was observed between steady and unsteady swimming performance, although U-crit and MMR were found to have coevolved. However, a further analysis within each typically occurring habitat group suggested that the trade-off that may exist between steady and unsteady swimming performance may be concealed by the effect of habitat.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	plant mating pollination sexual systems evolutionary transitions irreversible evolution	TACCA-CHANTRIERI TACCACEAE SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY HUMMINGBIRD POLLINATION BABIANA IRIDACEAE GENETIC DIVERSITY BREEDING SYSTEMS SEXUAL SYSTEMS BIRD PERCH SPECIALIZATION TURNERACEAE	Flowering plants are characterized by striking variation in reproductive systems, and the evolutionary lability of their sexual traits is often considered a major driver of lineage diversification. But, evolutionary transitions in reproductive form and function are never entirely unconstrained and many changes exhibit strong directionality. Here, I consider why this occurs by examining transitions in pollination, mating and sexual systems, some of which have been considered irreversible. Among pollination systems, shifts from bee to hummingbird pollination are rarely reversible, whereas transitions from animal to wind pollination are occasionally reversed. Specialized pollination systems can become destabilized through a loss of pollinator service resulting in a return to generalized pollination, or more commonly a reliance on self-pollination. Homomorphic and heteromorphic self-incompatibility systems have multiple origins but breakdown to self-compatibility occurs much more frequently with little evidence for subsequent gains, at least over short time-spans. Similarly, numerous examples of the shift from outcrossing to predominant self-fertilization are known, but cases of reversal are very limited supporting the view that autogamy usually represents an evolutionary dead-end. The evolution of dioecy from hermaphroditism has also been considered irreversible, although recent evidence indicates that the occurrence of sex inconstancy and hybridization can lead to the origin of derived sexual systems from dioecy. The directionality of many transitions clearly refutes the notion of unconstrained reproductive flexibility, but Novemberel adaptive solutions generally do not retrace earlier patterns of trait evolution.

This is especially true of annual plants where the cycle of floral initiation, pollination and seed production occur at regular intervals to ensure the survival of the species. In long-lived perennials, however, flowering can be an intermittent phenomenon and thus a challenge to understand. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Kobayashi et al. (2013) tackle this particular challenge by applying modern-day molecular techniques to the 'spectacular and mysterious' mass flowering that takes places in mixed dipterocarp forests of South-East Asia. Here, amidst an almost unimaginable diversity of forbs, shrubs and trees, these authors used next-generation sequencing technology to characterize what they refer to as the 'ecological transcriptome' in an attempt to glimpse into the functional genomic reprogramming of Shorea beccariana at pre-and postflowering developmental transitions. They encountered many of the challenges that are often underappreciated yet typical for tropical ecological research including sample collection within a similar to 40-m high tree canopy, unpredictable flowering intervals and determining the most appropriate pre-flowering state for sampling. Despite these challenges, the authors were able to integrate gene ontology relationships with gene-clustering algorithms and environmental data to support the hypothesis that drought is a key trigger for flowering in S. beccariana. The cloning and transgenic expression of selected S. beccariana genes to corroborate presumed protein function is a key feature of their work and seldom applied within an ecological framework. As illustrated by Kobayashi et al. (2013), the inclusion of molecular biology, genomics and bioinformatics has the potential to shed light on long-standing questions of ecological concern.

This group of animals has a long history that has mirrored the vicissitude of forests. The discrepancy in the distribution between fossils and extant species indicates a mysterious evolution history requiring further exploration. This study compiles the worldwide fossils of Pteromyini to the species level in order to reproduce the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of flying squirrels and deduce the ancestral distribution according to dispersal-vicariance analysis of a phylogeny of the extant species. In addition, we reconstruct the paleoenvironmental background and find that flying squirrels probably originated in the Oligocene-Miocene transition from Europe and immediately dispersed to Asia and North America. Influenced by glaciation, CO2 reduction, geologic movements and the Paratethys retreat, the Northern Hemisphere underwent climate deterioration and grassland expansion during the late Miocene, and thus the diversity of Pteromyini dramatically Decemberreased. The uplift of the Tibet Plateau in addition to the strengthened Asian monsoons intensified the aridity in central Asia, but brought sufficient water to the densely forested regions of South and Southeast Asia. These forests are likely both refugia and diversification center for flying squirrels during glacial periods in the Quarternary. The subsequent connection and Septemberaration events among these heterogeneous habitats has probably been a driving force in the speciation of flying squirrels. Based on this work, we predict a bleak future for the flying squirrels, one which is closely associated with the fate of forests in Asia.

When combined with the PlioPleistocene dolomitic cave deposits from the Cradle of Humankind, a rather restricted view emerges that South African early hominins derived from cave deposits, whereas those of east and central Africa are derived from fluvio-lacustrine and paleosol deposits. We undertook a sedimentological and paleomagnetic analysis of the pink-colored deposit (PCS) from which the Taung Child is purported to have derived and demonstrate that it is a calcrete, a carbonate-rich pedogenic sediment, which formed on the paleo-land surface. The deposit extends 100 s of meters laterally beyond the Dart and Hrdlika Pinnacles where it is interbedded with the Thabaseek Tufa, indicating multiple episodes of calcrete development and tufa growth. The presence of in situ rhizoconcretions and insect trace fossils (Celliforma sp. and Coprinisphaera sp.) and the distinctive carbonate microfabric confirm that the pink deposit is a pedogenic calcrete, not a calcified cave sediment. Paleomagnetic and stratigraphic evidence indicates that a second, reversed polarity, fossil-bearing deposit (YRSS) is a younger fissure-fill formed within a solutional cavity of the normal polarity tufa and pink calcrete (PCS). These observations have implications for the dating, environment, and taphonomy of the site, and increase the likelihood of future fossil discoveries within the Buxton-Norlim Limeworks.

This phrase of course refers to the early hope and current increasing success in the search for genes whose variation underlies phenotypic variation and fitness in natural populations. In the years since the modern incarnation of the field of ecological genomics, many would agree that the low-hanging fruit has, at least in principle, been plucked: we now have several elegant examples of genes whose variation influences key adaptive traits in natural populations, and these examples have revealed important insights into the architecture of adaptive variation (Hoekstra et al. 2006 Shapiro et al. 2009 Chan et al. 2010). But how well will these early examples, often involving single genes of large effect on discrete or near-discrete phenotypes, represent the dynamics of adaptive change for the totality of phenotypes in nature? Will traits exhibiting continuous rather than discrete variation in natural populations have as simple a genetic basis as these early examples suggest (Prasad et al. 2012 Rockman 2012)? Two papers in this issue (Robinson et al. 2013 Santure et al. 2013) not only suggest answers to these questions but also provide useful extensions of statistical approaches for ecological geneticists to study the genetics of continuous variation in nature. Together these papers, by the same research groups studying evolution in a natural population of Great Tits (Parus major), provide a glimpse of what we should expect as the field begins to dissect the genetic basis of what is arguably the most common type of variation in nature, and how genome-wide surveys of variation can be applied to natural populations without pedigrees.

However, virtually none of these statistical results have been experimentally tested and remain as hypotheses. To perform such experimental tests, we must connect genotype and phenotype and relate the phenotypic changes to the environmental and behavioral changes of the organism. The genotype-phenotype relationship can be established only by synthesizing and manipulating proper ancestral phenotypes, whereas the actual functions of adaptive mutations can be learned by studying their chemical roles in phenotypic changes.

Such reconstructions acknowledge that evidence from other colour-producing mechanisms is presently elusive and assume that melanosome geometry is not altered during fossilization. Here, we provide the first test of this assumption, using high pressure-high temperature autoclave experiments on modern feathers to simulate the effects of burial on feather colour. Our experiments show that melanosomes are retained despite loss of visual evidence of colour and complete degradation of other colour-producing structures (e.g. quasi-ordered arrays in barbs and the keratin cortex in barbules). Significantly, however, melanosome geometry and spatial distribution are altered by the effects of pressure and temperature. These results demonstrate that reconstructions of original plumage coloration in fossils where preserved features of melanosomes are affected by diagenesis should be treated with caution. Reconstructions of fossil feather colour require assessment of the extent of preservation of various colour-producing mechanisms, and, critically, the extent of alteration of melanosome geometry.

However, their interpretation requires an understanding of the complex interaction among foot anatomy, foot function, and soft sediment mechanics. We applied an experimental approach aimed at understanding how one measure of foot function, the distribution of plantar pressure, influences footprint topography. Thirty-eight habitually unshod and minimally shod Daasanach individuals (19 male, 19 female) walked across a pressure pad and produced footprints in sediment directly excavated from the geological layer that preserves 1.5 Ma fossil footprints at Ileret, Kenya. Calibrated pressure data were collected and three-dimensional models of all footprints were produced using photogrammetry. We found significant correlations (Spearman's rank, p < 0.0001) between measurements of plantar pressure distribution and relative footprint depths at ten anatomical regions across the foot. Furthermore, plantar pressure distributions followed a pattern similar to footprint topography, with areas of higher pressure tending to leave deeper impressions. This differs from the results of experimental studies performed in different types of sediment, supporting the hypothesis that sediment type influences the relationship between plantar pressure and footprint topography. Our results also lend support to previous interpretations that the shapes of the Ileret footprints preserve evidence of a medial transfer of plantar pressure during late stance phase, as seen in modern humans. However, the weakness of the correlations indicates that much of the variation in relative depths within footprints is not explained by pressure distributions under the foot when walking on firm ground, using the methods applied here. This warrants caution when interpreting the unique foot anatomies and foot functions of extinct hominins evidenced by their footprint structures. Further research is necessary to clarify how anatomical, functional, and sedimentary variables influence footprint formation and how each can be inferred from footprint morphology.

However, there is limited understanding of both the patterns and timing of population fluctuations in foundation trees and how they vary among geographical regions. We have reconstructed the demographic history of five genetically distinct populations of the Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus ssp. globulus) at the species and regional levels, using three nuclear loci sequenced from 104 individuals. Analysis using a Bayesian skyline plot indicated that the species experienced two periods of expansion, commencing in the Pliocene. Regional analyses showed that island populations expanded earlier, but that the rate of expansion was relatively slow when compared to that of the mainland group. This highlights the need for local demographic history to be taken into account when inferring local adaptation for candidate genes. Population growth throughout the Quaternary signals the ability of the species to persist and thrive under the predominantly harsh conditions of this period. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, very little is known about their true diversity and intraspecific population structure. Recent molecular studies on Marchine nematodes indicated cryptic diversity and strong genetic differentiation of distinct populations, but for freshwater nematode species, analogous studies are lacking. Here, we present the first extensive molecular study exploring cryptic species diversity and genetic population structure of a widespread freshwater nematode morphospecies, Tobrilus gracilis, from nine postglacially formed European lakes. Taxonomic species status of individuals, analysed for fragments of the mitochondrial COI gene and for the large (LSU) and small (SSU) ribosomal subunits, were determined by morphological characteristics. Mitochondrial and nuclear Marchkers strongly supported the existence of three distinct genetic lineages (Tg I-III) within Tobrilus gracilis, suggesting that this morphospecies indeed represents a complex of highly differentiated biological species. High genetic diversity was also observed at the population level. Across the nine lakes, 19 mitochondrial, and seven (LSU) and four (SSU) nuclear haplotypes were determined. A phylogeographical analysis revealed reMarchkable genetic differentiation even among neighbouring lake populations for one cryptic lineage. Priority and persistent founder effects are possible explanations for the observed population structure in the postglacially colonized lakes, but ask for future studies providing direct estimates of freshwater nematode dispersal rates. Our study suggests therefore that overall diversity of limnetic nematodes has been so far drastically underestimated and challenges the assumed ubiquitous distribution of other, single freshwater nematode morphospecies.

This has been demonstrated by comparing common regulatory sequences among species and by identifying single regulatory mutations that are associated with new phenotypes. However, while a single mutation changes a single element, gene regulation is accomplished by a regulatory network involving multiple interactive elements. Therefore, to better understand regulatory evolution, we have studied how mutations contributed to the adaptation of cells to a regulatory challenge. We created a synthetic genome rewiring in yeast cells, challenged their gene regulation, and studied their adaptation. HIS3, an essential enzyme for histidine biosynthesis, was placed exclusively under a GAL promoter, which is induced by galactose and strongly repressed in glucose. Such rewired cells were faced with significant regulatory challenges in a repressive glucose medium. We identified several independent mutations in elements of the GAL system associated with the rapid adaptation of cells, such as the repressor GAL80 and the binding sites of the activator GAL4. Consistent with the extraordinarily high rate of cell adaptation, new regulation emerged during adaptation via multiple trajectories, including those involving mutations in elements of the GAL system. The new regulation of HIS3 tuned its expression according to histidine requirements with or without these significant mutations, indicating that additional factors participated in this regulation and that the regulatory network could reorganize in multiple ways to accommodate different mutations. This study, therefore, stresses network plasticity as an important property for regulatory adaptation and evolution.

Using the fossil record and a multi-locus nuclear phylogeny, we examine divergence times, biogeography, body size evolution and patterns of community assembly of aquatic salamanders from North American coastal plains since the Late Cretaceous. At least five salamander families occurred on the extensive Western Interior Coastal Plain (WICP), which existed from the Late Cretaceous through the Eocene. Four of these families subsequently colonized the emergent Southeastern Coastal Plain (SECP) by the Early Oligocene to Late Miocene. Three families ultimately survived and underwent extensive body size evolution in situ on the SECP. This included at least two major size reversals in recent taxa that are convergent with confamilial WICP ancestors. Dynamics of the coastal plain, major lineage extinctions and frequent extreme changes in body size have resulted in significant shuffling of the size structure of aquatic salamander communities on this shifting refuge since the Cretaceous.

These have included higher intrinsic fitness of melanic forms and selective predation for camouflage. The possible existence and origin of heterozygote advantage has been debated. From the 1950s, as a result of experimental evidence, selective predation became the favoured explanation and is undoubtedly the major factor driving the frequency change. However, modelling and monitoring of Decemberlining melanic frequencies since the 1970s indicate either that migration rates are much higher than existing direct estimates suggested or else, or in addition, non-visual selection has a role. Recent molecular work on genetics has revealed that the melanic (carbonaria) allele had a single origin in Britain, and that the locus is orthologous to a major wing patterning locus in Heliconius butterflies. New methods of analysis should supply further information on the melanin system and on migration that will complete our understanding of this important example of rapid evolution.

Diploid parthenogenetic Artemia produce rare males, which may retain the ability to mate with females of related sexual lineages. Here, we (i) describe the frequency of male progeny in populations of diploid parthenogenetic Artemia, (ii) characterize rare males morphologically, (iii) assess their reproductive role, using cross-mating experiments with sexual females of related species from Central Asia and characterize the F1 hybrid offspring viability and (iv) confirm genetically both the identity and functionality of rare males using DNA barcoding and microsatellite loci. Our result suggests that these males may have an evolutionary role through genetic exchange with related sexual species and that diploid parthenogenetic Artemia is a good model system to investigate the evolutionary transitions between sexual species and parthenogenetic strains.

Several studies have shown that GABA plays different roles in plant metabolism including carbon-nitrogen metabolism, energy balance, signaling and development. It has been suggested that the occurrence of GABA and the enzymes related to GABA biosynthesis in prokaryotes and eukaryotes may be important in evolution and diversification. However, studies of GABA biosynthesis and GABA levels in an evolutionary context are restricted to sequenced plant genomes. In this study we aimed to compare the activities of GDH and GAD enzymes and total nitrogen, and the contents of total soluble protein, succinate, glutamate, proline and GABA in plants from different phylogenetic levels including Ulva lactuca, Pseudevernia furfuracea, Nephrolepsis exaltata, Ginkgo biloba, Pinus pinea, Magnolia grandiflora, Nymphaea alba, Urtica dioica, Portulaca oleraceae, Malva sylvestris, Rosa canina, Lavandula stoechas, Washingtonia filifera, Avena barbata and Iris kaempferi. The activities of GAD and GDH enzymes differed according to the species and were not always parallel to GABA levels. The discrepancy in the contents of succinate and GABA between higher and primitive plants was also prominent. Glutamate levels were high with a few exceptions and proline contents were at similar low values as compared to other amino acids. Our results support the hypothesis that the GABA shunt plays a key role in carbon and nitrogen partitioning via linking amino acid metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle which is essential for higher plant species.

Under such processes, observations at the tips of a phylogenetic tree have a multivariate Gaussian distribution, which may lead to suboptimal model specification under certain evolutionary conditions, as supposed in models of punctuated equilibrium or adaptive radiation. To consider non-normally distributed continuous trait evolution, we introduce a method to compute posterior probabilities when modeling continuous trait evolution as a Levy process. Through data simulation and model testing, we establish that single-rate Brownian motion (BM) and Levy processes with jumps generate distinct patterns in comparative data. We then analyzed body mass and endocranial volume measurements for 126 primates. We rejected single-rate BM in favor of a Levy process with jumps for each trait, with the lineage leading to most recent common ancestor of great apes showing particularly strong evidence against single-rate BM.

Yet, a global quantitative picture, at large evolutionary scale, of the relative strength of gBGC compared with selection and random drift is still lacking. Furthermore, owing to its dependence on the local recombination rate, gBGC results in modulations of the substitution patterns along genomes and across time which, if correctly interpreted, may yield quantitative insights into the long-term evolutionary dynamics of recombination landscapes. Deriving a model of the substitution process at putatively neutral nucleotide positions from population-genetics arguments, and accounting for among-lineage and among-gene effects, we propose a reconstruction of the variation in gBGC intensity at the scale of placental mammals, and of its scaling with body-size and karyotypic traits. Our results are compatible with a simple population genetics model relating gBGC to effective population size and recombination rate. In addition, among-gene variation and phylogenetic patterns of exon-specific levels of gBGC reveal the presence of rugged recombination landscapes, and suggest that short-lived recombination hot-spots are a general feature of placentals. Across placental mammals, variation in gBGC strength spans two orders of magnitude, at its lowest in apes, strongest in lagomorphs, microbats or tenrecs, and near or above the nearly neutral threshold in most other lineages. Combined with among-gene variation, such high levels of biased gene conversion are likely to significantly impact midly selected positions, and to represent a substantial mutation load. Altogether, our analysis suggests a more important role of gBGC in placental genome evolution, compared with what could have been anticipated from studies conducted in anthropoid primates.

To date, however, gene duplication has been reported only rarely in RNA viruses. Using a conservative BLAST approach we systematically screened for the presence of duplicated (i.e., paralogous) proteins in all RNA viruses for which full genome sequences are publicly available. Strikingly, we found only nine significantly supported cases of gene duplication, two of which are newly described here-in the 25 and 26 kDa proteins of Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (genus Benyvirus) and in the U1 and U2 proteins of Wongabel virus (family Rhabdoviridae). Hence, gene duplication has occurred at a far lower frequency in the recent evolutionary history of RNA viruses than in other organisms. Although the rapidity of RNA virus evolution means that older gene duplication events will be difficult to detect through sequence-based analyses alone, it is likely that specific features of RNA virus biology, and particularly intrinsic constraints on genome size, reduce the likelihood of the fixation and maintenance of duplicated genes.

Processes such as neo- and subfunctionalization impact the evolution of paralogous proteins where functional divergence is frequently key to retain the gene copies. Here, we examined antisilencing function 1 (ASF1), a conserved eukaryotic H3-H4 histone chaperone, involved in histone dynamics during replication, transcription, and DNA repair. Although yeast feature a single ASF1 protein, two paralogs exist in most vertebrates, termed ASF1a and ASF1b, with distinct cellular roles in mammals. To explain this division of tasks, we integrated evolutionary and comparative genomic analyses with biochemical and structural approaches. First, we show that a duplication event at the ancestor of jawed vertebrates, followed by ASF1a relocation into an intron of the minichromosome maintenance complex component 9 (MCM9) gene at the ancestor of tetrapods, provided a different genomic environment for each paralog with Marchked differences of GC content and DNA replication timing. Second, we found signatures of positive selection in the N- and C-terminal regions of ASF1a and ASF1b. Third, we demonstrate that regions outside the priMarchy interaction surface are key for the preferential interactions of the human paralogs with distinct H3-H4 chaperones. On the basis of these data, we propose that ASF1 experienced subfunctionalization shaped by the adaptation of the genes to their respective genomic context, reflecting a case of genomic context-driven escape from adaptive conflict.

However, the mechanisms that drive the evolution of the two, initially redundant, gene copies are still ill defined. Many gene duplicates experience evolutionary rate acceleration, but the relative contribution of positive selection and random drift to the retention and subsequent evolution of gene duplicates, and for how long the molecular clock may be distorted by these processes, remains unclear. Focusing on rodent genes that duplicated before and after the mouse and rat split, we find significantly increased sequence divergence after duplication in only one of the copies, which in nearly all cases corresponds to the Novemberel dAugusthter copy, independent of the mechanism of duplication. We observe that the evolutionary rate of the accelerated copy, measured as the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions, is on average 5-fold higher in the period spanning 4-12 My after the duplication than it was before the duplication. This increase can be explained, at least in part, by the action of positive selection according to the results of the maximum likelihood-based branch-site test. Subsequently, the rate Decemberelerates until purifying selection completely returns to preduplication levels. Reversion to the original rates has already been accomplished 40.5 My after the duplication event, corresponding to a genetic distance of about 0.28 synonymous substitutions per site. Differences in tissue gene expression patterns parallel those of substitution rates, reinforcing the role of neofunctionalization in explaining the evolution of young gene duplicates.

As cis and trans regulation operate through different molecular mechanisms, cis and trans mutations may show different inheritance patterns and may be subjected to different selective constraints. To investigate these issues, we obtained and analyzed gene expression data from two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and their hybrid, using high-throughput sequencing. Our data indicate that compared with other types of genes, those with antagonistic cis-trans interactions are more likely to exhibit over- or underdominant inheritance of expression level. Moreover, in accordance with previous studies, genes with trans variants tend to have a dominant inheritance pattern, whereas cis variants are enriched for additive inheritance. In addition, cis regulatory differences contribute more to expression differences between species than within species, whereas trans regulatory differences show a stronger association between divergence and polymorphism. Our data indicate that in the trans component of gene expression differences genes subjected to weaker selective constraints tend to have an excess of polymorphism over divergence compared with those subjected to stronger selective constraints. In contrast, in the cis component, this difference between genes under stronger and weaker selective constraint is mostly absent. To explain these observations, we propose that purifying selection more strongly shapes trans changes than cis changes and that positive selection may have significantly contributed to cis regulatory divergence.

However, gene overlapping also increases the deleterious effect of mutations as they affect more than one gene, thereby reducing the evolutionary rate of RNA viruses and hence their adaptive capacity. Although there is general agreement on the benefits of gene overlapping as a mechanism of genomic compression for rapidly evolving organisms, its effect on the pace of RNA virus evolution remains a source of debate. To address this issue, we collected sequence data from 117 instances of gene overlapping across 19 families, 30 genera, and 55 species of RNA viruses. On these data, we analyzed how genetic distances, selective pressures, and the distribution of RNA secondary structures and conserved protein functional domains vary between overlapping (OV) and noNovembererlapping (November) regions. We show that gene overlapping generally results in a Decemberrease in the rate of RNA virus evolution through a reduction in the frequency of synonymous mutations. However, this effect is less pronounced in genes with a terminal rather than an internal gene overlap, which might result from a greater proportion of protein functional conserved domains in November than in OV regions, in turn reducing the number of nonsynonymous mutations in the former. Overall, our analyses clarify the role of gene overlapping as a modulator of the evolutionary rates exhibited by RNA viruses and shed light on the factors that shape the genetic diversity of this important group of pathogens.

Data with finer resolution are needed for studying distributional changes during modern human history. Here, I show that printed wormholes in rare books and artwork are trace fossils of wood-boring species with unusually accurate locations and dates. Analyses of wormholes printed in western Europe since the fifteenth century document the detailed biogeographic history of two putative species of invasive wood-boring beetles. Their distributions now overlap broadly, as an outcome of twentieth century globalization. However, the wormhole record revealed, unexpectedly, that their original ranges were contiguous and formed a stable line across central Europe, apparently a result of competition. Extension of the wormhole record, globally, will probably reveal other species and evolutionary insights. These data also provide evidence for historians in determining the place of origin or movement of a woodblock, book, document or art print.

In this review, we highlight the importance of incorporating neutral and non-neutral genetic diversity when assessing the impacts of GCC, for example, in studies that aim to predict the future distribution and fate of a species or ecological community. Specifically, we address the following questions: Why study the effects of GCC on intraspecific genetic diversity? How does GCC affect genetic diversity? How is the effect of GCC on genetic diversity currently studied? Where is potential for future research? For each of these questions, we provide a general background and highlight case studies across the animal, plant and microbial kingdoms. We further discuss how cryptic diversity can affect GCC assessments, how genetic diversity can be integrated into studies that aim to predict species' responses on GCC and how conservation efforts related to GCC can incorporate and profit from inclusion of genetic diversity assessments. We argue that studying the fate of intraspecifc genetic diversity is an indispensable and logical venture if we are to fully understand the consequences of GCC on biodiversity on all levels.

Mapping of recombination sites has proved to be difficult, particularly, in the human MHC region that is complicated by both population variation and highly polymorphic HLA genes. To overcome these problems, HLA-typed individuals from three representative populations: Asian, European and African were used to generate phased HLA haplotypes. Extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) plots constructed from the phased haplotype data revealed discreet EHH drops corresponding to recombination events and these signatures were observed to be different for each population. Surprisingly, the majority of recombination sites detected are unique to each population, rather than being common. Unique recombination sites account for 56.8% (21/37 of total sites) in the Asian cohort, 50.0% (15/30 sites) in Europeans and 63.2% (24/38 sites) in Africans. Validation carried out at a known sperm typing recombination site of 45 kb (HLA-F-telomeric) showed that EHH was an efficient method to narrow the recombination region to 826 bp, and this was further refined to 660 bp by resequencing. This approach significantly enhanced mapping of the genomic architecture within the human MHC, and will be useful in studies to identify disease risk genes.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether craniometric variation among contemporary Mexicans is comparable to that reported in genetic studies. Standard osteometric measurements were taken on 82 male crania derived from forensic cases, with geographic origins of the specimens spanning over two-thirds of Mexico's states. To study similarities in regional clustering patterns with genetic data, k-means clustering analyses were performed, followed by chi-square tests of association between cluster assignments and geographic region of origin. Normal mixtures analyses were performed, centered on three ancestral sample proxies to estimate classification probability to each ancestry. The results demonstrate that the cranial morphological sample data cluster similarly to the regional groupings inferred from the genetic data. Additionally, the results indicate a gradient trend in population structure for contemporary Mexicans, with the proportion of Amerindian ancestry increasing from North to South while, conversely, European ancestry proportion estimates increase from South to North. Furthermore, the probabilities for classification of African ancestry remained low across the regions, again reflecting the results for the genetic data. Cranial morphological variation is well aligned with the genetic data for describing broad trends among Mexican populations, as well as yielding comparable estimates of general ancestry affiliations that reflect Mexico's history of Spanish contact and colonialism.

Single locus effects in the evolution of gene expression networks in spruce	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	adaptation gymnosperms molecular evolution transcriptomics	TRANSCRIPT-LEVEL VARIATION BOREAL BLACK SPRUCE CLIMATE-CHANGE BUDDING YEAST GENOME ARABIDOPSIS ADAPTATION ARCHITECTURE PROTEIN POPULATIONS	Genetic variation in gene expression traits contributes to phenotypic diversity and may facilitate adaptation following environmental change. This is especially important in long-lived organisms where adaptation to rapid changes in the environment must rely on standing variation within populations. However, the extent of expression variation in most wild species remains to be investigated. We address this question by measuring the segregation of expression levels in white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench), Voss] in a transcriptome-wide manner and examining the underlying evolutionary and biological processes. We applied a Novemberel approach for the genetic analysis of expression variation by measuring its segregation in haploid meiotic seed tissue. We identified over 800 transcripts whose abundances are most likely controlled by variants in single loci. Cosegregation analysis of allelic expression levels was used to construct regulatory associations between genes and define regulatory networks. The majority (67%) of segregating transcripts were under linkage. Regulatory associations were typically among small groups of genes (23 transcripts), indicating that most segregating expression levels can evolve independently from one another. One notable exception was a large putative trans effect that altered the expression of 180 genes that includes key regulators of protein metabolism, highlighting a regulatory cascade affected by variation in a single locus in this conserved metabolic pathway. Overall, segregating expression variation was associated with stress response- and duplicated genes, whose evolution may be linked to functional inNovemberations. These observations indicate that expression variation might be important in facilitating diversity of molecular responses to environmental stresses in wild trees.

Herein we quantitatively describe aspects of the genetic architecture of two sets of traits, male genitalic morphology and oviposition preference, that putatively function as barriers to gene flow between the butterfly species Lycaeides idas and L. melissa. Our analyses are based on unmapped DNA sequence data and a recently developed Bayesian regression approach that includes variable selection and explicit parameters for the genetic architecture of traits. A modest number of nucleotide polymorphisms explained a small to large proportion of the variation in each trait, and average genetic variant effects were nonnegligible. Several genetic regions were associated with variation in multiple traits or with trait variation within- and among-populations. In some instances, genetic regions associated with trait variation also exhibited exceptional genetic differentiation between species or exceptional introgression in hybrids. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that divergent selection on male genitalia has contributed to heterogeneous genetic differentiation, and that both sets of traits affect fitness in hybrids. Although these results are encouraging, we highlight several difficulties related to understanding the genetics of speciation.

With the rapid development of massively parallel sequencing nanotechnology (or next-generation sequencing) and simultaneous maturation of bioinformatic tools, this situation has dramatically changed. Genome-wide thinking is forging its way into disciplines like evolutionary biology or molecular ecology that were historically confined to small-scale genetic approaches. Accessibility to genome-scale information is transforming these fields, as it allows us to answer long-standing questions like the genetic basis of local adaptation and speciation or the evolution of gene expression profiles that until recently were out of reach. Many in the eco-evolutionary sciences will be working with large-scale genomic data sets, and a basic understanding of the concepts and underlying methods is necessary to judge the work of others. Here, I briefly introduce next-generation sequencing and then focus on transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq). This article gives a broad overview and provides practical guidance for the many steps involved in a typical RNA-seq work flow from sampling, to RNA extraction, library preparation and data analysis. I focus on principles, present useful tools where appropriate and point out where caution is needed or progress to be expected. This tutorial is mostly targeted at beginners, but also contains potentially useful reflections for the more experienced.

Previous studies aimed to identify such regions either used pre-defined genomic locations such as coding sequences and conserved genomic elements or employed sliding window methods. Such approaches may miss clusters of substitutions occurring in regions other than those pre-defined locations, or not be able to distinguish human-specific clusters of substitutions from regions of generally high substitution rates. Here, we conduct a 'maximal segment' analysis to scan the whole human genome to identify clusters of human-specific substitutions that occurred since the divergence of the human and the chimpanzee genomes. This method can identify species-specific clusters of substitutions while not relying on pre-defined regions. We thus identify thousands of clusters of human-specific single nucleotide substitutions. The evolution of such clusters is driven by a combination of several different evolutionary processes including increased regional mutation rate, recombination-associated processes, and positive selection. These newly identified regions of human-specific substitution clusters include large numbers of previously identified human accelerated regions, and exhibit significant enrichments of genes involved in several developmental processes. Our study provides a useful tool to study the evolution of the human genome. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

EVOLUTION	Adaptation allometry geometric morphometrics latitude thermal plasticity	5 QUANTITATIVE TRAITS LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS NATURAL-POPULATIONS BODY-SIZE DEVELOPMENTAL TEMPERATURE THERMAL EVOLUTION EASTERN AUSTRALIA GENETIC-VARIATION STRESSFUL TEMPERATURE MORPHOMETRICAL TRAITS	Geographical patterns of morphological variation have been useful in addressing hypotheses about environmental adaptation. In particular, latitudinal clines in phenotypes have been studied in a number of Drosophila species. Some environmental conditions along latitudinal clinesfor example, temperaturealso vary along altitudinal clines, but these have been studied infrequently and it remains unclear whether these environmental factors are similar enough for convergence or parallel evolution. Most clinal studies in Drosophila have dealt exclusively with univariate phenotypes, allowing for the detection of clinal relationships, but not for estimating the directions of covariation between them. We measured variation in wing shape and size in D. melanogaster derived from populations at varying altitudes and latitudes across sub-Saharan Africa. Geometric morphometrics allows us to compare shape changes associated with latitude and altitude, and manipulating rearing temperature allows us to quantify the extent to which thermal plasticity recapitulates clinal effects. Comparing effect vectors demonstrates that altitude, latitude, and temperature are only partly associated, and that the altitudinal shape effect may differ between Eastern and Western Africa. Our results suggest that selection responsible for these phenotypic clines may be more complex than just thermal adaptation.

GASTROPODA LAND SNAILS PULMONATA STYLOMMATOPHORA HELICOIDEA CLASSIFICATION GENUS ALIGNMENTS MORPHOLOGY EVOLUTION	Gomez-Moliner, B.J., Elejalde, A.M., Arrebola, J.R., Puente, A.I., Marchtinez-Orti, A., Ruiz, A. & Madeira, MJ. (2012). Molecular phylogeny of the Helicodontidae and Trissexodontidae (Gastropoda). Zoologica Scripta, 00, 000000. In this study, we present a molecular phylogeny of the Trissexodontidae and Helicodontidae obtained by means of Maximum Parsimony, Neighbor Joining, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses of DNA sequences. Nearly 3KB of sequence data of two mitochondrial genes (COI, 16S rDNA) and the nuclear rRNA gene cluster including ITS-1, the 3end of the 5.8S gene, the complete ITS-2 region and 5 end of the large subunit 28S were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of these two families. Monophyly of Trissexodontidae and Helicodontidae at the family level is well supported. A new classification of the genera in the Trissexodontidae is proposed. It includes two subfamilies: Gittenbergeriinae (monotypic for Gittenbergeria turriplana) and Trissexodontinae. The latter includes three strongly supported tribes: (i) Trissexodontini, including Mastigophallus, Trissexodon, Oestophorella and Suboestophora (ii) Oestophorini, with Oestophora and (iii) Caracollinini, with Caracollina, Gasulliella, Gasullia and Hatumia. The polytypic Oestophora and Suboestophora are recovered as two monophyletic genera. The anatomy of the auxiliary copulatory organs of the reproductive system is coherent with the new taxonomic interpretation of the Trissexodontidae. Further work, including some more taxa is needed to delimitate subfamilies within Helicodontidae. Finally, the addition of some sequences of other Helicoidea shows that the genus Ciliella is not closely related to Trissexodontidae, being grouped within the Hygromiidae, instead.

It is characterized by an androdioecious sexual system, which is rare in angiosperms. We conducted a molecular phylogenetic analysis of 29 taxa including 61 samples from the tribe Morindeae to elucidate the geographical origin of G. boninensis by determining its progenitor species. We also investigated evolutionary transitions among different sexual systems within this plant group. The combined ETS, ITS, and trnT-F sequence data showed that G. boninensis formed a monophyletic group, but it did not form a clade with G. umbellata, which was treated as the same species, whereas it formed a clade with G. parvifolia, which is distributed in southeastern Asia. This suggests that G. boninensis evolved independently from G. umbellata, and probably originated from a progenitor native to southeastern Asia. In the clade composed of the three species of G. boninensis, G. parvifolia, and G. umbellate, only G. boninensis is androdioecious, whereas the others are dioecious. Thus, the androdioecious sexual system of G. boninensis may have evolved from dioecy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although gynodioecy often occurs in self-compatible species, the effect of self-pollination, inbreeding depression, and pollen limitation acting differently on females and hermaphrodites remains poorly known in the case of nuclear-cytoplasmic gynodioecy (NCG). In this study, we model NCG in an infinite population and we study the effect of selfing rate, inbreeding depression, and pollen limitation on the maintenance of gynodioecy and on sex ratios at equilibrium. We found that selfing and inbreeding depression have a strong impact, which depends on whether restorer cost acts on male or female fitness. When cost affects male fitness, the strength of cost has no effect, whereas selfing and inbreeding depression only impact gynodioecy by modifying the value of the female advantage. When cost affects female fitness, selfing facilitates NCG and reduces the role of strength of the cost, even when no inbreeding depression occurs, whereas inbreeding depression globally restricts the maintenance of the polymorphism. Finally, we found that pollen limitation could additionally strongly modify the dynamic of gynodioecy. We discuss our findings in the light of empirical data available in gynodioecious species.

One potential mechanism for this is dispersal by flight. Therefore, we would expect flying animals to show adaptations in wing shape related to habitat variation. In this work, we explored variation in wing shape in relation to preferred water body (flowing water or standing water with tolerance for temporary conditions) and landscape (forested to open) using 32 species of dragonflies of the genus Trithemis (80% of the known species). We included a potential source of variation linked to sexual selection: the extent of wing coloration on hindwings. We used geometric morphometric methods for studying wing shape. We also explored the phenotypic correlation of wing shape between the sexes. We found that wing shape showed a phylogenetic structure and therefore also ran phylogenetic independent contrasts. After correcting for the phylogenetic effects, we found (i) no significant effect of water body on wing shape (ii) male forewings and female hindwings differed with regard to landscape, being progressively broader from forested to open habitats (iii) hindwings showed a wider base in wings with more coloration, especially in males and (iv) evidence for phenotypic correlation of wing shape between the sexes across species. Hence, our results suggest that natural and sexual selection are acting partially independently on fore- and hindwings and with differences between the sexes, despite evidence for phenotypic correlation of wing shape between males and females.

It took several Decemberades of research to fully grasp these ideas and document the pattern of hominoid rate slowdown. Along the way, studies of hominoid rate slowdown led to major progresses in understanding determinants of neutral molecular evolution, which in turn is used to calibrate rates of adaptive evolution. Furthermore, the growing knowledge on the origin of mutations provides a basis for understanding differential evolutionary rates between sex chromosomes and autosomes, which has deep implications for inferring human evolutionary histories, and other aspects of molecular evolution. Primate genomics in particular stand to provide critical information in these pursuits, due to the abundance of genomic data, relatively rich documentation of life history traits, and several model systems, including our own species.

Here, we suggest that haplodiploidy may instead promote eusociality simply by facilitating sex-ratio adjustment. Specifically, haplodiploidy may enable sex-ratio bias toward the more helpful sex, owing to local resource enhancement, and such sex-ratio bias may promote the evolution of helping by individuals of that sex, owing to the rarer-sex effect. This could explain why haplodiploidy appears to have been important for eusociality in taxa with only female helpers, such as ants, wasps, and bees, but not in taxa with both male and female helpers, such as termites.

However, the degree of antagonism between plant and herbivore may depend critically on the timing of their interactions and the intrinsic value of a leaf. We present a model that investigates whether and when the timing of plant defense and herbivore feeding activity can be optimized by evolution so that their interactions can move from antagonistic to neutral. We assume that temporal changes in environmental conditions will affect intrinsic leaf value, measured as potential carbon gain. Using optimal-control theory, we model herbivore evolution, first in response to fixed plant strategies and then under coevolutionary dynamics in which the plant also evolves in response to the herbivore. In the latter case, we solve for the evolutionarily stable strategies of plant defense induction and herbivore hatching rate under different ecological conditions. Our results suggest that the optimal strategies for both plant and herbivore are to avoid direct conflict. As long as the plant has the capability for moderately lethal defense, the herbivore will modify its hatching rate to avoid plant defenses, and the plant will never have to use them. Insights from this model offer a possible solution to the paradox of sublethal defenses and provide a mechanism for stable plant-herbivore interactions without the need for natural enenmy control.

Our report demonstrates that the Moula-Guercy hominid remains contribute important morphological, developmental, and behavioral data to understanding Neanderthal evolutionary history. We include gross comparative morphological descriptions and enamel surface microstructure and microwear data. These teeth reveal numerous characteristics that are diagnostic of Neanderthals and provide no evidence for the presence of any other hominid taxa. Enamel growth increment data from the Moula-Guercy specimens yield evidence of a Neanderthal pattern of development, although at the lower end of the range of variation. The presence of a significant number of linear enamel hypoplasias indicates that these individuals were stressed during childhood. Molar microwear data suggest that these Neanderthals did not differ significantly from modern humans in terms of the fracture properties of the food they were consuming. The incisor microwear and macro striations provide evidence that these individuals may have been using their anterior teeth as tools, similar to the practices of several modern human populations such as the Inuit, Ipiutak, and Australian Aboriginals, and reminiscent of evidence from other Neanderthals from Krapina, Croatia, as well as the 600,000 year old hominids from Sima de los Huesos, Spain.

These tali belong to 14 individuals (11 adult and three immature). Although variation among Middle and Late Pleistocene tali tends to be subtle, this study has identified unique morphological characteristics of the SH tali. They are vertically shorter than those of late Pleistocene Homo sapiens, and show a shorter head and a broader lateral malleolar facet than all of the samples. Moreover, a few shared characters with Neanderthals are consistent with the hypothesis that the SH population and Neanderthals are sister groups. These shared characters are a broad lateral malleolar facet, a trochlear height intermediate between modern humans and Late Pleistocene H. sapiens, and a short middle calcaneal facet. It has been possible to propose sex assignment for the SH tali based on their size. Stature estimates based on these fossils give a mean stature of 174.4 cm for males and 161.9 cm for females, similar to that obtained based on the long bones from this same site.

Each included angiosperm genome was aligned to a reference genome, Arabidopsis thaliana, using the LASTZ/MULTIZ paradigm and tools from the University of California-Santa Cruz Genome Browser source code. In addition to the multiple alignment, we created a local genome browser displaying multiple tracks of newly generated genome annotation, as well as annotation sourced from published data of other research groups. An investigation into A. thaliana gene features present in the aligned A. lyrata genome revealed better conservation of start codons, stop codons, and splice sites within our alignments (51% of features from A. thaliana conserved without interruption in A. lyrata) when compared with previous publicly available plant pairwise alignments (34% of features conserved). The detailed view of conservation across angiosperms revealed not only high coding-sequence conservation but also a large set of previously uncharacterized intergenic conservation. From this, we annotated the collection of conserved features, revealing dozens of putative noncoding RNAs, including some with recorded small RNA expression. Comparing conservation between kingdoms revealed a faster Decemberay of vertebrate genome features when compared with angiosperm genomes. Finally, conserved sequences were searched for folding RNA features, including but not limited to noncoding RNA (ncRNA) genes. Among these, we highlight a double hairpin in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the PRIN2 gene and a putative ncRNA with homology targeting the LAF3 protein.

We sequenced a set of six pools of 18-25 individuals using a single sequencing lane. This allowed us to build around 600000 contigs, among which at least 386000 could be mapped to the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) genome. This yielded more than 80000 SNPs that could be mapped unambiguously and are evenly distributed across the genome. Thus, our approach provides a good illustration of the high potential of paired-end RAD sequencing of pooled DNA samples combined with comparative assembly to the zebra finch genome to build large contigs and characterize vast numbers of informative SNPs in nonmodel passerine bird species in a very efficient and cost-effective way.

Layered upon this are gene- and lineage-specific variation in amino acid substitution rates and compositional biases. Life trait variations that may impact upon mutational rates are longevity, metabolic rate, body size, and germ line generation time. Over the past 12 years, three main conflicting hypotheses have emerged for the placement of the placental root. These hypotheses place the Atlantogenata (common ancestor of Xenarthra plus Afrotheria), the Afrotheria, or the Xenarthra as the sister group to all other placental mammals. Model adequacy is critical for accurate tree reconstruction and by failing to account for these compositional and character exchange heterogeneities across the tree and data set, previous studies have not provided a strongly supported hypothesis for the placental root. For the first time, models that accommodate both tree and data set heterogeneity have been applied to mammal data. Here, we show the impact of accurate model assignment and the importance of data sets in accommodating model parameters while maintaining the power to reject competing hypotheses. Through these sophisticated methods, we demonstrate the importance of model adequacy, data set power and provide strong support for the Atlantogenata over other competing hypotheses for the position of the placental root.

Consistent behavioural differences over time and across situations (e.g. personality) are increasingly cited as examples of individual variation observed within populations. However, the suggestion that heterogeneous selective pressures target different animal personalities remains largely untested in the wild. In this 5-year study, we investigated the dynamics of viability selection on a personality trait, exploration, in a population of eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) experiencing substantial seasonal variations in weather conditions and food availability associated with masting trees. Contrary to our expectations, we found no evidence of fluctuating selection on exploration. Instead, we found strong disruptive viability selection on adult exploration behaviour, independent of seasonal variations. Individuals with either low or high exploration scores were almost twice as likely to survive over a 6-month period compared with individuals with intermediate scores. We found no evidence of viability selection on juvenile exploration. Our results highlight that disruptive selection might play an important role in the maintenance of phenotypic variance of wild populations through its effect on different personality types across temporally varying environmental conditions.

Different types of stylar polymorphism are described in which the discrete characterization of the exact polymorphic type (e.g., distyly vs. stigma-height dimorphism) requires detailed floral measurements (e.g., sex-organ reciprocity). In clonal and aquatic Nymphoides montana, although the presence of two floral morphs that contain styles of two lengths has been previously reported, no studies have quantitatively estimated the level of reciprocity and/or described the stylar condition. Morphological variations and incompatibility relationships were explored between the two morphs in three southeastern Australian populations. In this study, one population is characterized as stigma-height dimorphism (i.e., two morphs with discrete variation in stigma height but little variation in anther height), whereas the other two populations are typical distylous (i.e., two morphs for reciprocal stigma and anther height). Nymphoides montana is dimorphic in a wide range of ancillary characters, including corolla size, stigma size, shape and papillae morphology, and pollen size, number and exine sculpture. Following glasshouse pollinations, full incompatibility systems were observed in the distylous populations, whereas the stigma-height dimorphic population showed between-morph variation in the extent of incompatibility. Despite the variation in sex-organ reciprocity and incompatibility, other lines of evidence appear to assure the maintenance of the stylar polymorphism in the N. montana study populations. All populations are nearly isoplethic (i.e., both morphs in equal frequencies), which is indicative of balanced polymorphisms that appear to be maintained by legitimate pollen transfer between the morphs.

However, societies, such as those of social insects, also benefit from genetic diversity, e.g. through enhanced disease resistance and division of labour. Effects of genetic diversity have been investigated in a few complex eusocial species. Here, we show that genetically based division of labour may also be important in 'simple societies', with fewer individuals and limited morphological caste differentiation. The ponerine ant Pachycondyla inversa has small colonies, headed by several unrelated queens. We show that nest-mate workers from different matrilines engage in different tasks, have distinct chemical profiles and associate preferentially with kin in the nest, while queens and brood stay together. This suggests that genetically based division of labour may precede the evolution of complex eusociality and facilitate the existence of low relatedness societies functioning as associations of distinct families that mutually benefit from group living.

We have characterized a difference in pupariation site choice within and between sibling species of Drosophila. We found that, in nature, Drosophila sechellia pupariate within their host fruit, Morinda citrifolia, and that they perform this behavior in laboratory assays. In contrast, in the laboratory, geographically diverse strains of Drosophila simulans vary in their pupariation site preference D. simulans lines from the ancestral range in southeast Africa pupariate on fruit, or a fruit substitute, whereas populations from Europe or the New World select sites off of fruit. We explored the genetic basis for the evolved preference in puariation site preference by performing quantitative trait locus mapping within and between species. We found that the interspecific difference is controlled largely by loci on chromosomes X and II. In contrast, variation between two strains of D. simulans appears to be highly polygenic, with the majority of phenotypic effects due to loci on chromosome III. These data address the genetic basis of how new traits arise as species diverge and populations disperse.

The Wedge eye-spot (Wes) is a new homeotic mutant located on the sixth linkage group. Homozygous Wes/ Wes embryos are lethal and display a pair of antenna-like appendages under the mouthparts as well as fused thoracic segments. These mutants also exhibit a narrower eye-spot at the larval stage compared with the wild type. By positional cloning, we identified the candidate gene of the Wes locus, Bombyx mori Antennapedia (BmAntp). Two BmAntp transcripts were identified in the homozygote of the Wes mutant, including a normal form and an abnormal form with a 1570-bp insertion. Our data showed that the insertion element was a long interspersed nuclear element (LINE)-like transposon that destroyed the original open reading frame of BmAntp. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of normal BmAntp transcripts were increased Marchkedly in the Wes heterozygous larvae compared with the wild type. Furthermore, we performed RNAi of BmAntp and observed fused thoracic segments and defective thoracic legs in the developing embryos. Our results indicated that BmAntp is responsible for the Wes mutant and has an important role in determining the proper development of the thoracic segments. Our identification of a homeotic mutation in the silkworm is an important contribution to our understanding of the regulation of Hox genes at different levels of expression.

For Streptococcus thermophilus, there is no direct evidence that the bacteria might acquire a second paralog from a different origin in the same niche. In this study, we found that four isolates of S. thermophilus (B, C, E and F) from the same yoghurt contained two putative homologs of the eno genes (eno-1 and eno-2) and two putative homologs of the guaB genes (guaB-1 and guaB-2). Both eno-1 and guaB-1 shared 100% nucleotide identity among the four isolates, and with isolate A and S. thermophilus ND03. Phylogenetic and nucleotide divergence analyses indicated that guaB-2 of these isolates may have been acquired from species in the genus Streptococcus, while eno-2 of isolates B and C may have been acquired from a donor in the genus Streptococcus. The eno-2 genes of isolates E and F may have been acquired from a donor in the Entero coccus genera. Relative synonymous codon usage analysis confirmed the eno-2 genes of isolates E and F as being acquired from a donor in genus Enterococcus. This study provides evidence that interfamily and interspecies HGT occur in S. thermophilus strains isolated from the same niche. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although evidence for beneficial fitness effects of HGT is overwhelming, recently acquired regions often function inefficiently within new genomic backgrounds so that each transfer event has the potential to disrupt existing regulatory and physiological networks. Identifying and exploring costs is essential for guiding general discussions about the interplay between selection and HGT, as well as generating hypotheses to explain how HGT affects evolutionary potential through, for example, changing adaptive trajectories. Focusing on costs of HGT as foundations for future studies will enhance exploration at the interface between acquired regions and recipient genomes, including the process of amelioration, and enable experimental evaluation of the role of HGT in structuring genetic diversity across populations.

Here, we present evidence for the presence of a gene encoding functional isopenicillin N synthase, an enzyme in the beta-lactam antibiotics biosynthesis pathway, in the genome of the soil-living collembolan species, Folsomia candida (FcIPNS). At present, this gene is only known from bacteria and fungi, as is the capacity to produce beta-lactam antibiotics. The FcIPNS gene was located on two genomic contigs, was physically linked to a predicted insect ATP-binding cassette transporter gene, and contained three introns each flanked by eukaryotic splicing recognition sites (GT/AG). Homology searches revealed no similarity between these introns and the FcIPNS regions of bacteria or fungi. All amino acids conserved across bacteria and fungi were also conserved in F. candida. Recombinant FcIPNS was able to convert its substrate amino delta-(l-alpha-aminoadipyl)-l-cysteinyl-d-valine into isopenicillin N, providing strong evidence that FcIPNS is functional. Phylogenetic analysis clustered FcIPNS outside the bacterial IPNS clade, and also outside the fungal IPNS clade, suggesting an ancient gene transfer followed by divergence in the F. candida genome. In conclusion, the data suggest that the soil-living collembolan F. candida has assimilated the capacity for antibacterial activity by horizontal gene transfer, which may be an important adaptive trait in the microbe-dominated soil ecosystem.

When populations diverge in hormone-mediated phenotypes, differences may arise via changes in circulating hormones, sensitivity to hormones or both. Determining the relative importance of signal and sensitivity requires consideration of both inter- and intrapopulation variation in hormone levels, hormone sensitivity and phenotype, but such studies are rare, particularly among closely related taxa. We compared males of two subspecies of the dark-eyed Juneco (Juneco hyemalis) for territorial aggression and associations among behaviour, circulating testosterone (T), and gene expression of androgen receptor (AR), aromatase (AROM) and oestrogen receptor in three behaviourally relevant brain regions. Thus, we examined the degree to which evolution may shape behaviour via changes in plasma T as compared with key sex steroid binding/converting molecules. We found that the white-winged Juneco (J. h. aikeni) was more aggressive than the smaller, less ornamented Carolina Juneco (J. h. carolinensis). The subspecies did not differ in circulating testosterone, but did differ significantly in the abundance of AR and AROM mRNA in key areas of the brain. Within populations, both gene expression and circulating T co-varied significantly with individual differences in aggression. Notably, the differences identified between populations were opposite to those predicted by the patterns among individuals within populations. These findings suggest that hormonephenotype relationships may evolve via multiple pathways, and that changes that have occurred over evolutionary time do not necessarily reflect standing physiological variation on which current evolutionary processes may act.

Merr.) in North America. Recently, resistant soybean lines have been discovered and at least four aphid resistance genes (Rag1, Rag2, Rag3 and rag4) have been mapped on different soybean chromosomes. However, the evolution of new soybean aphid biotypes capable of defeating host-plant resistance conferred by most single genes demonstrates the need for finding germplasm with multigenic resistance to the aphid. This study was conducted to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for aphid resistance in PI 567324. We identified two major QTL (QTL_13_1 and QTL_13_2) for aphid resistance on soybean chromosome 13 using 184 recombinant inbred lines from a 'Wyandot' x PI 567324 cross. QTL_13_1 was located close to the previously reported Rag2 gene locus, and QTL_13_2 was close to the rag4 locus. A minor QTL (QTL_6_1) was also detected on chromosome 6, where no gene for soybean aphid resistance has been reported so far. These results indicate that PI 567324 possesses oligogenic resistance to the soybean aphid. The molecular Marchkers closely linked to the QTL reported here will be useful for development of cultivars with oligogenic resistance that are expected to provide broader and more durable resistance against soybean aphids compared with cultivars with monogenic resistance.

To illustrate the dynamics of this important but little studied form of coevolution, we have modeled an ongoing arms race between Drosophila melanogaster and the vertically transmitted sigma virus, using parameters we estimated in the field. We integrate these results with previous work showing that the spread of a resistance allele of the ref(2)P gene in the host was followed by the spread of a virus genotype, which overcomes this resistance. In line with these observations, our model predicts that there can be rapid selective sweeps in both the host and parasite, which can drive large changes in the prevalence of infection. The virus will tend to be ahead in the arms race, as incomplete dominance slows down host adaptation and selection for host resistance is weaker than selection for parasites to overcome resistancethe life-dinner principle. This asymmetry in the adaptation rates results in a partial sweep of the host resistance allele, as it loses its advantage part way through the selective sweep. This well-understood natural system illustrates how the outcome of hostparasite coevolution is determined by different population genetic parameters in the field.

These questions are linked by their mutual focus on the relationship between genetic variation, which is often limited in asexuals, and the ability to respond to environmental variation. Asexual taxa originating from a single ancestor present a unique opportunity to assess rates of phenotypic and genetic change when access to new genetic variation is limited to mutation. Diachasma muliebre is an asexual Hymenopteran wasp that is geographically and genetically isolated from all sexual relatives. D. muliebre attack larvae of the western cherry fruit fly (Rhagoletis indifferens), which in turn feed inside bitter cherry fruit (Prunus eMarchginata) in Augustust and Septembertember. R. indifferens has recently colonized a new host plant with an earlier fruiting phenology (Junee/Julyy), domesticated sweet cherries (P. avium), and D. muliebre has followed its host into this temporally earlier niche. We tested three hypotheses: 1) that all D. muliebre lineages originate from a single asexual ancestor 2) that different D. muliebre lineages (as defined by unique mtDNA haplotypes) have differentiated on their ancestral host in an important life-history trait, eclosion timing and 3) that early-eclosing lineages have preferentially colonized the new sweet cherry niche. We find that mitochondrial COI and microsatellite data provide strong support for a single ancestral origin for all lineages. Furthermore, COI sequencing revealed five mitochondrial haplotypes among D. muliebre, and individual wasps possessing one distinctive mitochondrial haplotype (haplotype II) eclosed as reproductive adults significantly earlier than wasps with all other haplotypes. In addition, this early-eclosing lineage of D. muliebre is one of two lineages that have colonized the P. avium habitat, consistent with the preferential colonization hypothesis. These data suggest that D. muliebre has evolved adaptive phenotypic variation despite limited genetic variation, and that this variation has subsequently allowed an expansion of some wasps into a Novemberel habitat. The D. muliebre system may allow for in-depth study of adaptation and long-term persistence of asexual taxa.

What is the relative importance of selection vs. drift? How many genes are involved, what are their effect sizes and where are they located in the genome? The answers to these questions will inevitably vary from one species to another, but by addressing these questions in a diverse array of taxa, we will gradually piece together a more complete picture of how evolution works. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Parchman etal. () have approached these questions by studying the genomic basis of differentiation along a hybrid zone between two Central American bird species, the golden-collared (Manacus vitellinus) and white-collared (Manacus candei) manakins (see Fig.). Their work presents an interesting window into the evolution of this hybrid zone using Novemberel analysis tools and a nice example of how to approach the study of population genomics in nonmodel organisms.

One approach to this question has been to examine the genetic basis of convergent traits, which likely evolved repeatedly under a shared selective pressure. We investigated the convergent phenotype of blue iris pigmentation, which has arisen independently in four primate lineages: humans, blue-eyed black lemurs, Japanese macaques, and spider monkeys. Characterizing the phenotype across these species, we found that the variation within the blue-eyed subsets of each species occupies strongly overlapping regions of CIE L*a*b* color space. Yet whereas Japanese macaques and humans display continuous variation, the phenotypes of blue-eyed black lemurs and their sister species (whose irises are brown) occupy more clustered subspaces. Variation in an enhancer of OCA2 is priMarchily responsible for the phenotypic difference between humans with blue and brown irises. In the orthologous region, we found no variant that distinguishes the two lemur species or associates with quantitative phenotypic variation in Japanese macaques. Given the high similarity between the blue iris phenotypes in these species and that in humans, this finding implies that evolution has used different molecular paths to reach the same end.

Do environmental changes affect both the sign and the magnitude of epistasis? Are there any correlations between environments in the variability, sign or magnitude of epistasis? Very few studies have tackled these questions. Here, we addressed them in the context of viral emergence. Most emerging viruses are RNA viruses with small genomes, overlapping reading frames and multifunctional proteins for which epistasis is abundant. Understanding the effect of host species in the sign and magnitude of epistasis will provide insights into the evolutionary ecology of infectious diseases and the predictability of viral emergence.

Here we investigate how the cultural transmission of traits affecting survival, fertility, or both can influence the birth rate, age structure, and asymptotic growth rate of a population. We show that the strong spread of such a trait can lead to a demographic transition, similar to that experienced in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, without using ecological or economic optimizing models. We also show that the spread of a cultural trait that increases fertility, but not survival, can cause demographic change similar to the 'Neolithic demographic transition': a period of increased population growth that is thought to have accompanied the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural lifestyles. We investigate the roles of vertical, oblique, and horizontal learning of such a trait in this transition and find that compared to vertical learning alone, horizontal and oblique learning can accelerate the trait's spread, lead to faster population growth, and increase its equilibrium frequency.

Also, social learning, a crucial requirement for culture, is particularly developed in humans and provides a means to accumulate knowledge over time and to develop advanced technologies. However, the type of social learning required for the evolution of this complex material culture is still debated. Here, using a complex and opaque virtual task, the efficiency of individual learning and two types of social learning (product-copying and process-copying) were compared. We found that (1) individuals from process-copying groups outperformed individuals from product-copying groups or individual learners, whereas access to product information was not a sufficient condition for providing an advantage to social learners compared to individual learners (2) social learning did not seem to affect the exploration of the fitness landscape (3) social learning led to strong within-group convergence and also to between-group convergence, and (4) individuals used widely variable social learning strategies. The implications of these results for cumulative culture evolution are discussed.

Using a mathematical model, I investigated the conditions under which cultural traits tend to be improved for a higher level of culture to evolve. In the model, I consider three ways of learning: individual learning, simple social learning, and improvements of socially learned cultural traits (social improvement). I obtain the evolutionarily stable number of cultural traits acquired through each way of learning. I show that organisms improve many socially learned cultural traits under the following conditions: (1) environmental stability is intermediate (2) the environment is severe (3) the success rate of individual learning is high (4) the utility of cultural traits acquired by individual learning is large (5) the accuracy of social learning is high and (6) the increase in the utility of beneficial cultural traits attained by social improvement is large. I also show that when organisms have greater ability for social improvement, the average utility of the beneficial cultural trait increases, the proportion of beneficial cultural traits among all cultural traits Decemberreases, and the total number of cultural traits acquired by the three ways of learning is constant. These results shed light on the origins of human cumulative culture. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This complexity can be understood, at least partially, by modeling the underlying demographic parameters in the evolutionary process. In this study, we analyze a model of human evolution in which population size, gene flow (GF), and time are varied. Specifically, we simulate mitochondrial DNA for 42 demographic scenarios, represented by 42 parameter combinations, to describe the initial dispersal of modern humans out of Africa. The analyses include three values for colonization size (CS 1%, 10%, and 30% of the African population), seven values for rate of GF (10(-6)-0.5), and two values for time of colonization (50,000 and 100,000 years ago). We then estimate sumMarchy statistics for the simulated data sets to calculate the percent of explained variation by each parameter and to identify which parameter combinations generate distinct differences in genetic variation, that is, which demographic scenarios can be distinguished from each other. On the basis of these results, we make recommendations about which sumMarchy statistics to use according to the parameter of interest. Our results show that CS, GF, and their interaction have the largest effect on genetic variation under our model of human evolution. Comparison with empirical data suggests that 1% of the existing African mitochondrial genetic variation left and colonized the rest of the world (i.e., CS = 1%) and bidirectional GF continued at a level of similar to 10 individuals per generation (i.e., GF = 10(-3)) after the initial colonization. Our study serves as a model to bridge the gap between the use of simulations for theoretical population genetics and empirical data analysis such as approximate Bayesian computation approaches and is, thus, applicable to the study of molecular evolution in any organism.

Hybridization and asymmetric mitochondrial introgression in two Caribbean lizards (Anolis pulchellus and Anolis krugi)	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	Caribbean Sea DNAH3 evolutionary diversification hybridization mitochondrial DNA mitochondrial introgression ND2 NKTR nuclear DNA phylogeography population genetics Puerto Rico selection West Indies	PUERTO-RICO HISTORICAL BIOGEOGRAPHY EXTENSIVE INTROGRESSION DNA EVOLUTION SPECIATION POPULATION DIVERSITY NUCLEAR PHYLOGENETICS	Hybridization and gene introgression can occur frequently between closely related taxa, but appear to be rare phenomena among members of the species-rich West Indian radiation of Anolis lizards. We investigated the pattern and possible mechanism of introgression between two sister species from Puerto Rico, Anolis pulchellus and Anolis krugi, using mitochondrial (ND2) and nuclear (DNAH3, NKTR) DNA sequences. Our findings demonstrated extensive introgression of A. krugi mtDNA (k-mtDNA) into the genome of A. pulchellus in western Puerto Rico, to the extent that k-mtDNA has mostly or completely replaced the native mtDNA of A. pulchellus on this part of the island. We proposed two not mutually exclusive scenarios to account for the interspecific matings between A. pulchellus and A. krugi. We inferred that hybridization events occurred independently in several populations, and determined that k-mtDNA haplotypes harboured in individuals of A. pulchellus can be assigned to four of the five major mtDNA clades of A. krugi. Further, the spatial distribution of k-mtDNA clades in the two species is largely congruent. Based on this evidence, we concluded that natural selection was the probable driving mechanism for the extensive k-mtDNA introgression into A. pulchellus. Our two nuclear data sets yielded different results. DNAH3 showed reciprocal monophyly of A. pulchellus and A. krugi, indicating no effect of hybridization on this Marchker. In contrast, the two species shared nine NKTR alleles, probably due to incomplete lineage sorting. Our study system will provide an excellent opportunity to experimentally assess the behavioural and ecological mechanisms that can lead to hybridization in closely related taxa.

Interbreeding between divergent but morphologically similar lineages can produce exceptional phenotypes, but the potential for transgressive variation to facilitate long-term trait changes in derived hybrid lineages has received little attention. We compare pollinator-mediated selection on transgressive floral traits in both early-generation and derived hybrid lineages of the Piriqueta cistoides ssp. caroliniana complex. The bowl-shaped flowers of morphotypes in this complex have similar gross morphologies and attract a common suite of small insect pollinators. However, they are defined by significant differences in characters that generate pollinator interest and visitation, including floral area and petal Septemberaration. In common garden experiments, patterns of pollen deposition in early-generation recombinant hybrids indicate that Piriqueta's pollinators favour flowers with greater area and reduced petal Septemberaration. Changes in floral morphology in derived hybrid lineages are consistent with predictions from selection gradients, but the magnitude of change is limited relative to the range of transgressive variation. These results suggest that hybridization provides variation for evolution of divergent floral traits. However, the potential for extreme transgressive variants to contribute to phenotypic shifts may be limited due to reduced heritability, evolutionary constraints or fitness trade-offs.

The zoonotic pathogens Campylobacter coli and C. jeJunei differ from each other by around 15% at the nucleotide level, corresponding to an average of nearly 40 amino acids per protein-coding gene. Using whole genome sequencing, we show that a single C. coli lineage, which has successfully colonized an agricultural niche, has been progressively accumulating C. jeJunei DNA. Members of this lineage belong to two groups, the ST-828 and ST-1150 clonal complexes. The ST-1150 complex is less frequently isolated and has undergone a substantially greater amount of introgression leading to replacement of up to 23% of the C. coli core genome as well as import of Novemberel DNA. By contrast, the more commonly isolated ST-828 complex bacteria have 1011% introgressed DNA, and C. jeJunei and nonagricultural C. coli lineages each have <2%. Thus, the C. coli that colonize agriculture, and consequently cause most human disease, have hybrid origin, but this cross-species exchange has so far not had a substantial impact on the gene pools of either C. jeJunei or nonagricultural C. coli. These findings also indicate reMarchkable interchangeability of basic cellular machinery after a prolonged period of independent evolution.

Population dynamics associated with Haldane's rule may play an important role in early speciation of sexually reproducing organisms. The dynamics of the hybrid zone maintained by incomplete hybrid inferiority (sterility/inviability) in the heterogametic sex (a weak Haldane's rule) caused by a BatesonDobzhanskyMuller incompatibility was modelled. The influences and interplays of the strengths of incompatibility, dispersal, density-dependent regulation (DDR) and local adaptation of incompatible alleles in a scenario of short-range dispersal (the stepping-stone model) were examined. It was found that a partial heterogametic hybrid incompatibility could efficiently impede gene flow and maintain characteristic clinal noncoincidence and discordance of alleles. Density-dependent regulation appears to be an important factor affecting hybrid zone dynamics: it can effectively skew the effects of the partial incompatibility and dispersal as measured by effective dispersal, clinal structures and density depression. Unexpectedly, local adaptation of incompatible alleles in the parental populations, which would be critical for the establishment of the incompatibility, exerts little effect on hybrid zone dynamics. These results strongly support the plausibility of the adaptive origin of hybrid incompatibility and ecological speciation: an adaptive mutation, if it confers a Marchginal fitness advantage in the local population and happens to cause epistatic inferiority in hybrids, could efficiently drive further genetic divergence that may result in the gene becoming an evolutionary hotspot.

Hybridization may slow or reverse differentiation by allowing gene flow and recombination. It may accelerate speciation via adaptive introgression or cause near-instantaneous speciation by allopolyploidization. It may have multiple effects at different stages and in different spatial contexts within a single speciation event. We offer a perspective on the context and evolutionary significance of hybridization during speciation, highlighting issues of current interest and debate. In secondary contact zones, it is uncertain if barriers to gene flow will be strengthened or broken down due to recombination and gene flow. Theory and empirical evidence suggest the latter is more likely, except within and around strongly selected genomic regions. Hybridization may contribute to speciation through the formation of new hybrid taxa, whereas introgression of a few loci may promote adaptive divergence and so facilitate speciation. Gene regulatory networks, epigenetic effects and the evolution of selfish genetic material in the genome suggest that the DobzhanskyMuller model of hybrid incompatibilities requires a broader interpretation. Finally, although the incidence of reinforcement remains uncertain, this and other interactions in areas of sympatry may have knock-on effects on speciation both within and outside regions of hybridization.

The Ranunculus cantoniensis complex and its allied species include R. chinensis (2x), R. silerifolius var. silerifolius (2x), R. cantoniensis (4x), R. trigonus (2x), R. shuichengensis (2x), R. diffusus (4x), R. repens (4x), R. vaginatus (5x) and R. sieboldii (6x, 8x). Many morphological intermediates can be found between the members of this complex, and the relationship among members is complicated. By analyzing internal transcribed spacers and nrDNA FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) signals, we unraveled the phylogenetic and genetic constitution of the various taxonomic units of this complex. Haplotypes were highly Septemberarated by median-joining network analysis and at least four haplogroups emerged in which there were 11 priMarchy haplotypes six out of ten taxa shared haplotype 1, suggesting that haplotype 1, a variation of the priMarchy haplotype R. chinensis, served as the pivotal genome in the complex. The pollen characteristics and electrophoretic patterns of R. vaginatus (5x) showed it to be an intermediate between R. diffusus (4x) and R. sieboldii (6x). The distribution of R. vaginatus (5x) was located at the Junection of the distributions of R. diffusus (4x) and R. sieboldii (6x). Ranunculus vaginatus (5x) shared haplotypes 7 and 8 with R. diffusus (4x), and haplotypes 8 and 9 with R. sieboldii (6x). This proved that R. vaginatus (5x) emerged from hybridization between R. diffusus (4x) and R. sieboldii (6x). The results of FISH also support a hybrid origin of R. vaginatus (5x). The findings of this study clearly show that there are only eight taxa in this polyploid complex including R. chinensis (2x), R. silerifolius var. silerifolius (2x), R. trigonus (2x), R. silerifolius var. dolicanthus(2x), R. cantoniensis (4x), R. diffusus (2x), R. vaginatus (5x) and R. sieboldii (6x, 8x). These taxa associated with each other by hybridizing with the pivotal genome. Ranunculus cantoniensis (4x) and R. vaginatus (5x) arose from hybridization events between diverged species in the polyploid complex, leading to a complicated reticulate evolution.

MICROEVOLUTION POPULATIONS FREQUENCIES PREDATION PATTERN	I made use of the known dates of reclamation (and of afforestations) in the IJsselmeerpolders in The Netherlands to assess evolutionary adaptation in Cepaea nemoralis. At 12 localities (three in each polder), I sampled a total of 4390 adult individuals in paired open and shaded habitats, on average 233 m apart, and scored these for genetic shell colour polymorphisms. The results show (highly) significant differentiation at most localities, although the genes involved differed per locality. Overall, though, populations in shaded habitats had evolved towards darker shells than those in adjacent open habitats, whereas a 'Cain & Sheppard' diagram (proportion yellow shells plotted against 'effectively unbanded' shells) failed to reveal a clear pattern. This might suggest that thermal selection is more important than visual selection in generating this pattern. Trait differentiation, regardless of whether they were plotted against polder age or habitat age, showed a linear increase of differentiation with time, corresponding to a mean rate of trait evolution of 15-31 kilodarwin. In conclusion, C. nemoralis is capable of rapid and considerable evolutionary differentiation over 1-25 snail generations, though equilibrium may be reached only at longer time scales.

One Marchker commonly assumed to be a single-copy gene and claimed to harbor great utility for inferring recent divergences is elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha). To test this hypothesis, we systematically cloned EF-1 alpha in three disJunect populations of the harvestman Metasiro americanus. Here we show that EF-1 alpha has a large number of paralogs in this species. The paralogs do not evolve in a concerted manner, and the paralogs diverged prior to the population divergence. Moreover, the paralogs of M. americanus are not comparable to the highly divergent EF-1 alpha paralogs found in bees and spiders, which are easily recognized and Septemberarated through the use of specific primers. We demonstrate statistically that our detection of paralogs cannot be attributed to amplification error. The presence of EF-1 alpha paralogs in M. americanus prevents its use in statistical phylogeography, and the presence of out-paralogs argues against its use in phylogenetic inference among recently diverged clades. These data contradict the common assumption that EF-1 alpha is for most or all taxa a single-copy gene, or that it has a small number of paralogs that are homogenized through gene conversion, unequal crossing over, or other processes.

Ctenomys minutus is a highly karyotype-polymorphic subterranean rodent, with diploid numbers ranging from 42 to 50 and autosomal arm numbers (ANs) ranging from 68 to 80, comprising a total of 45 karyotypes described so far. This species inhabits the southern Brazilian coastal plain, which has a complex geological history, with several potential geographical barriers acting on different time scales. We assessed the geographical genetic structure of C. minutus, examining 340 individuals over the entire distributional range and using information from chromosomal rearrangements, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and 14 microsatellite loci. The mtDNA results revealed seven main haplogroups, with the most recent common ancestors dating from the Pleistocene, whereas clustering methods defined 12 populations. Some boundaries of mtDNA haplogroups and population clusters can be associated with potential geographical barriers to gene flow. The isolation-by-distance pattern also has an important role in fine-scale genetic differentiation, which is strengthened by the narrowness of the coastal plain and by common features of subterranean rodents (that is, small fragmented populations and low dispersal rates), which limit gene flow among populations. A step-by-step mechanism of chromosomal evolution can be suggested for this species, mainly associated with the metapopulation structure, genetic drift and the geographical features of the southern Brazilian coastal plain. However, chromosomal variations have no or very little role in the diversification of C. minutus populations.

However, the use of statistical niche models in combination with the analysis of phenotypic variation along environmental gradients can help to reduce such complexity and identify a subset of candidate factors. In the present study, we used such approaches to describe and identify factors responsible for the parapatric distribution of two closely-related livebearer fish species along a salinity gradient in the lowlands of Trinidad, West Indies. The downstream distribution limits of Poecilia reticulata were strongly correlated with the brackishfreshwater interface. We did not observe significant phenotypic variation in life-history traits for this species when comparing Marchginal with more central populations, suggesting that abrupt changes in conditions at the brackishfreshwater interface limit its distribution. By contrast, Poecilia picta was present across a wide range of salinities, although it gradually disappeared from upstream freshwater localities. In addition, P.picta populations exhibited an increase in offspring size in localities where they coexist with P.reticulata, suggesting a role for interspecific competition. The parapatric distribution of these two species, suggests that P.reticulata distributions are limited by an abiotic factor (salinity), whereas P.picta is limited by a biotic factor (interspecific competition). Similar parapatric patterns have been previously described in other systems, suggesting they might be a common pattern in nature.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London	June 22, 2013Experimental evolution reveals trade-offs between mating and immunity	BIOLOGY LETTERS	sexual selection sperm competition immune function	MOTH PLODIA-INTERPUNCTELLA SPERM COMPETITION SEXUAL SELECTION DUNG FLIES PATTERNS INVESTMENT RESPONSES DEFENSE SIZE	Immune system maintenance and upregulation is costly. Sexual selection intensity, which increases male investment into reproductive traits, is expected to create trade-offs with immune function. We assayed phenoloxidase (PO) and lytic activity of individuals from populations of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, which had been evolving under different intensities of sexual selection. We found significant divergence among populations, with males from female-biased populations having lower PO activity than males from balanced sex ratio or male-biased populations. There was no divergence in anti-bacterial lytic activity. Our data suggest that it is the increased male mating demands in female-biased populations that trades-off against immunity, and not the increased investment in sperm transfer per mating that characterizes male-biased populations.

Walls based this concept of a longer episode of nOctoberurnality in early eutherian mammals by comparing the visual systems of reptiles, birds and all three extant taxa of the mammalian lineage, namely the monotremes, Marchsupials (now included in the metatherians) and placentals (included in the eutherians). This review describes the status of what has become known as the nOctoberurnal bottleneck hypothesis, giving an overview of the chronobiological patterns of activity. We review the ecological plausibility that the activity patterns of (early) eutherian mammals were restricted to the night, based on arguments relating to endothermia, energy balance, foraging and predation, taking into account recent palaeontological information. We also assess genes, relating to light detection (visual and non-visual systems) and the photolyase DNA protection system that were lost in the eutherian mammalian lineage. Our conclusion presently is that arguments in favour of the nOctoberurnal bottleneck hypothesis in eutherians prevail.

One such transition is that from single cells to multicellularity. Conflicts among cells in multicellular organisms can be greatly reduced if they consist of genetically identical clones. However, mutations to cheaters that experience one round of within-individual selection could still be a problem, particularly for certain life cycles. We propose an experimental evolution method to investigate this issue, using micro-organisms to construct multicellular pseudo-organisms, which can be evolved under different artificial life cycles. These experiments can be used to test the importance of various life cycle features in maintaining cooperation. They include structured reproduction, in which small propagule size reduces within-individual genetic variation. They also include structured growth, which increases local relatedness within individual bodies. Our method provides a Novemberel way to test how different life cycles favour cooperation, even for life cycles that do not exist.

Although troglodyte features evolved independently many times in cavefish, we do not yet know whether independent evolution of these characters involves common genetic mechanisms. Surface-dwelling and many cave-dwelling species make the freshwater teleost genus Sinocyclocheilus an excellent model for studying the evolution of adaptations to life in constant darkness. We compared the mature retinal histology of surface and cave species in Sinocyclocheilus and found that adult cavefish showed a reduction in the number and length of photoreceptor cells. To identify genes and genetic pathways that evolved in constant darkness, we used RNA-seq to compare eyes of surface and cave species. De Novembero transcriptome assemblies were developed for both species, and contigs were annotated with gene ontology. Results from cave-dwelling Sinocyclocheilus revealed reduced transcription of phototransduction and other genes important for retinal function. In contrast to the blind Mexican tetra cavefish Astyanax mexicanus, our results on morphologies and gene expression suggest that evolved retinal reduction in cave-dwelling Sinocyclocheilus occurs in a lens-independent fashion by the reduced proliferation and downregulation of transcriptional factors shown to have direct roles in retinal development and maintenance, including cone-rod homeobox (crx) and Wnt pathway members. These results show that the independent evolution of retinal degeneration in cavefish can occur by different developmental genetic mechanisms.

The relative contributions of gut-resident and intracellular symbionts to host metabolism, and how they coevolve are not well understood. Cockroaches and the termite Mastotermes darwiniensis present a unique opportunity to examine the evolution of spatially Septemberarated symbionts, as they harbour gut symbionts and the intracellular symbiont Blattabacterium cuenoti. The genomes of B. cuenoti from M. darwiniensis and the social wood-feeding cockroach Cryptocercus punctulatus are each missing most of the pathways for the synthesis of essential amino acids found in the genomes of relatives from non-wood-feeding hosts. Hypotheses to explain this pathway degradation include: (i) feeding on microbes present in rotting wood by ancestral hosts (ii) the evolution of high-fidelity transfer of gut microbes via social behaviour. To test these hypotheses, we sequenced the B. cuenoti genome of a third wood-feeding species, the phylogenetically distant and non-social Panesthia angustipennis. We show that host wood-feeding does not necessarily lead to degradation of essential amino acid synthesis pathways in B. cuenoti, and argue that ancestral high-fidelity transfer of gut microbes best explains their loss in strains from M. darwiniensis and C. punctulatus.

Both the cytochrome b data set and the combined data set were analysed under maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian criteria. Like previous studies, a monophyletic Akodon clade was recovered. Monophyly of the boliviensis and cursor groups was supported, and the two form a strongly supported sister relationship. Akodon azarae is basal to and forms a monophyletic group with the boliviensis+cursor clade, resolving the placement of A.azarae but leaving it unassignable to a current Akodon species group. The aerosus and varius groups are paraphyletic as four members of the varius group (A.glaucinus, A.simulator, A.tartareus and A.varius) fall within the aerosus group. Akodon lindberghi is formally placed in the cursor group. Akodon caenosus is recognized as a species distinct of A.lutescens, A.orientalis is recognized as a species distinct of A.orophilus, and A.aerosus, A.baliolus and A.surdus are recognized as three Septemberarate species. Based upon chronophylogenetic analysis, the initial divergence within Akodon likely began during the late Pliocene and ancestors of the four extant species groups (aerosus, boliviensis, cursor and dolores) appeared around the Pleistocene-Pliocene boundary or shortly thereafter.

Class I knotted-like homeobox (KNOX I) genes are known as crucial regulators of shoot meristem formation and maintenance. KNOX I genes maintain the undifferentiated state of the apical meristem and are locally downregulated upon leaf initiation. In Arabidopsis, KNOX I genes, especially SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM), have been shown to regulate flower development and the formation of carpels. We investigated the role of STM-like genes in the reproductive development of Eschscholzia californica, to learn more about the evolution of KNOX I gene function in basal eudicots. We identified two orthologs of STM in Eschscholzia, EcSTM1 and EcSTM2, which are predominantly expressed in floral tissues. In contrast, a KNAT1/BP-like and a KNAT2/6-like KNOX I gene are mainly expressed in vegetative organs. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) was used to knockdown gene expression, revealing that both EcSTM genes are required for the formation of reproductive organs. Silencing of EcSTM1 resulted in the loss of the gynoecium and a reduced number of stamens. EcSTM2-VIGS flowers had reduced and defective gynoecia and a stronger reduction in the number of stamen than observed in EcSTM1-VIGS. Co-silencing of both genes led to more pronounced phenotypes. In addition, silencing of EcSTM2 alone or together with EcSTM1 resulted in altered patterns of internodal elongation and sometimes in other floral defects. Our data suggest that some aspects of STM function present in Arabidopsis evolved already before the basal eudicots diverged from core eudicots.

In the Eastern tiger swallowtail butterfly, Papilio glaucus, females are dimorphic. One morph ('dark-morph') is mostly black and mimics the toxic pipevine swallowtail, Battus philenor. These females have large amounts of blue coloration on the dorsal hind wings that enhances their mimetic resemblance. Conversely, the alternate female type ('yellow-morph') is similar to males in coloration with the exception of extensive dorsal blue coloration, comparable to dark-morph females. Such coloration is almost completely absent in males. We examined dorsal blue coloration in P. glaucus to determine if mimetic resemblance in dark morphs is predominantly responsible for the maintenance of dorsal blue color in both female types, or whether mate recognition and/or sexual selection by males has a stronger influence on this trait. We measured the relative amount and variance of dorsal and ventral blue coloration in females of both color morphs, as well as males. We also compared these measurements to similar ones taken in the sister species, P. canadensis (which does not exhibit female dimorphism). Lastly, we investigated mate recognition and preferences of wild males. Our results suggest that mimetic resemblance may be more important than sexual selection for sustaining dorsal blue coloration in dark-morph females and that yellow-morphs could have elevated levels of blue due to currently unknown genetic associations. Although trait correlation between sexes is common, intrasexual trait correlation in a sex-limited, polymorphic species has not been frequently observed.

The choice of one or the other option may be flexible, as when individuals respond to attractive dispersal options, or they may reflect fixed life-history trajectories. Here, we show in a permanently Marchked, natural population of the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher that subordinate helpers reduce investment in territory defence shortly before dispersing. Such reduction of effort is not shown by subordinates who stay and inherit the breeding position. This difference suggests that subordinates ready to leave reduce their investment in the natal territory strategically in favour of future life-history perspectives. It seems to be part of a conditional choice of the dispersal tactic, as this reduction in effort appears only shortly before dispersal, whereas philopatric and dispersing helpers do not differ in defence effort earlier in life. Hence, cooperative territory defence is state-dependent and plastic rather than a consistent part of a fixed life-history trajectory.

Scleractinian corals grow by building up aragonitic exoskeletons that provide support and protection for soft tissues. Although this process has been extensively studied, the molecular basis of biocalcification is poorly understood. Notably lacking is a comprehensive catalog of the skeleton-occluded proteins-the skeletal organic matrix proteins (SOMPs) that are thought to regulate the mineral deposition. Using a combination of proteomics and transcriptomics, we report the first survey of such proteins in the staghorn coral Acropora millepora. The organic matrix (OM) extracted from the coral skeleton was analyzed by mass spectrometry and bioinformatics, enabling the identification of 36 SOMPs. These results provide Novemberel insights into the molecular basis of coral calcification and the macroevolution of metazoan calcifying systems, whereas establishing a platform for studying the impact of OA at molecular level. Besides secreted proteins, extracellular regions of transmembrane proteins are also present, suggesting a close control of aragonite deposition by the calicoblastic epithelium. In addition to the expected SOMPs (Asp/Glu-rich, galaxins), the skeletal repertoire included several proteins containing known extracellular matrix domains. From an evolutionary perspective, the number of coral-specific proteins is low, many SOMPs having counterparts in the noncalcifying cnidarians. Extending the comparison with the skeletal OM proteomes of other metazoans allowed the identification of a pool of functional domains shared between phyla. These data suggest that co-option and domain shuffling may be general mechanisms by which the trait of calcification has evolved.

EVOLUTION	Demography gene flow genetic variance local adaptation secondary contact sourcesink dynamics	CLOSELY ADJACENT PLANT BLACK-HOLE SINK MarchGINAL HABITATS LOCAL ADAPTATION GENE FLOW HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES QUANTITATIVE GENETICS INBREEDING DEPRESSION DENSITY-DEPENDENCE SPECIES RANGE	In heterogeneous landscapes, the genetic and demographic consequences of dispersal influence the evolution of niche width. Unless pollen is limiting, pollen dispersal does not contribute directly to population growth. However, by disrupting local adaptation, it indirectly affects population dynamics. We compare the effect of pollen versus seed dispersal on the evolution of niche width in heterogeneous habitats, explicitly considering the feedback between maladaptation and demography. We consider two scenarios: the secondary contact of two subpopulations, in distinct, formerly isolated habitats, and the colonization of an empty habitat with dispersal between the new and ancestral habitat. With an analytical model, we identify critical levels of genetic variance leading to niche contraction (secondary contact scenario), or expansion (new habitat scenario). We confront these predictions with simulations where the genetic variance freely evolves. Niche contraction occurs when habitats are very different. It is faster as total gene flow increases or as pollen predominates in overall gene flow. Niche expansion occurs when habitat heterogeneity is not too high. Seed dispersal accelerates it, whereas pollen dispersal tends to retard it. In both scenarios very high seed dispersal leads to extinction. Overall, our results predict a wider niche for species dispersing seeds more than pollen.

Here we used Southern blot hybridisation, PCR and sequencing approaches to analyse genomic organisation of rRNA genes in all large gymnosperm groups, including Coniferales, Ginkgoales, Gnetales and Cycadales. The data are provided for 27 species (21 genera). The 5S units linked to the 35S rDNA units occur in some but not all Gnetales, Coniferales and in Ginkgo (similar to 30% of the species analysed), while the remaining exhibit Septemberarate organisation. The linked 5S rRNA genes may occur as single-copy insertions or as short tandems embedded in the 26S-18S rDNA intergenic spacer (IGS). The 5S transcript may be encoded by the same (Ginkgo, Ephedra) or opposite (Podocarpus) DNA strand as the 18S-5.8S-26S genes. In addition, pseudogenised 5S copies were also found in some IGS types. Both L- and S-type units have been largely homogenised across the genomes. Phylogenetic relationships based on the comparison of 5S coding sequences suggest that the 5S genes independently inserted IGS at least three times in the course of gymnosperm evolution. Frequent transpositions and rearrangements of basic units indicate relatively relaxed selection pressures imposed on genomic organisation of 5S genes in plants.

Although members have been identified in a large variety of vertebrate and nonvertebrate species, the origin and relationship of these proteins remain unresolved. To address this issue, we employed large-scale genome comparisons to identify genome fragments with conserved synteny and matched these fragments to linkage groups in reconstructed early gnathostome ancestral chromosomes (GAC). This genome comparison revealed that most receptor and peptide genes were clustered in three GAC linkage groups and suggested that the ancestral forms of five peptide subfamilies (corticotropin-releasing hormone-like, calcitonin-like, parathyroid hormone-like, glucagon-like, and growth hormone-releasing hormone-like) and their cognate receptor families emerged through tandem local gene duplications before two rounds (2R) of whole-genome duplication. These subfamily genes have, then, been amplified by 2R whole-genome duplication, followed by additional local duplications and gene loss prior to the divergence of land vertebrates and teleosts. This study delineates a possible evolutionary scenario for whole secretin-like peptide and receptor family members and may shed light on evolutionary mechanisms for expansion of a gene family with a large number of paralogs.

The selection of suitable Marchkers for the reconstruction of solid phylogenetic hypotheses is therefore fundamental. The lichen genus Usnea is highly diverse, with more than 350 estimated species, distributed in polar, temperate and tropical regions. The phylogeny and classification of Usnea have been a matter of debate, given the lack of phenotypic characters to describe phylogenetic clades and the low degree of resolution of phylogenetic trees. In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic relationships of 52 Usnea species from across the genus, based on ITS rDNA, nuLSU, and two protein-coding genes RPB1 and MCM7. ITS comprised several highly variable regions, containing substantial genetic signal, but also susceptible to causing bias in the generation of the alignment. We compared several methods of alignment of ITS and found that a simultaneous optimization of alignment and phylogeny (using BAli-phy) improved significantly both the topology and the resolution of the phylogenetic tree. However the resolution was even better when using protein-coding genes, especially RPB1 although it is less variable. The phylogeny based on the concatenated dataset revealed that the genus Usnea is subdivided into four highly-supported clades, corresponding to the traditionally circumscribed subgenera Eumitria, Dolichousnea, Neuropogon and Usnea. However, characters that have been used to describe these clades are often homoplasious within the phylogeny and their parallel evolution is suggested. On the other hand, most of the species were reconstructed as monophyletic, indicating that combinations of phenotypic characters are suitable discriminators for delimitating species, but are inadequate to describe generic subdivisions.

Equilibrium models of cytonuclear gynodioecy, which describe the effect of natural selection within populations on the sex ratio, predict that the frequency of females in a population will priMarchily depend on the cost of male fertility restoration, a negative pleiotropic effect of Rf alleles on hermaphrodite fitness. Specifically, when the cost of restoration is higher, the frequency of females at equilibrium is predicted to be higher. To test this prediction, we estimated variation in the cost of restoration across 26 populations of Lobelia siphilitica, a species in which Rf alleles can have negative pleiotropic effects on pollen viability. We found that L. siphilitica populations with many females were more likely to contain hermaphrodites with low pollen viability. This is consistent with the prediction that the cost of restoration is a key determinant of variation in female frequency. Our results suggest that equilibrium models can explain variation in sex ratio among natural populations of gynodioecious species.

In some cases, developmental cues can be used to match phenotype to environmenta strategy known as predictive plasticity. When environmental conditions are entirely unpredictable, generating random phenotypic diversity may improve the long-term success of a lineagea strategy known as diversified bet hedging. When partially reliable information is available, a well-adapted developmental strategy may strike a balance between the two strategies. We use information theory to analyze a model of development in an uncertain environment, where cue reliability is affected by variation both within and between generations. We show that within-generation variation in cues Decemberreases the reliability of cues without affecting their fitness value. This transpires because the optimal balance of predictive plasticity and diversified bet hedging is unchanged. However, within-generation variation in cues does change the developmental mechanisms used to create that balance: developmental sensitivity to such cues not only helps match phenotype to environment but also creates phenotypic diversity that may be useful for hedging bets against environmental change. Understanding the adaptive role of developmental sensitivity thus depends on a proper assessment of both the predictive power and the structure of variation in environmental cues.

In the prospective diastema of the embryo, small rudimentary buds are found that are presumed to be rudiments of suppressed teeth. A supernumerary tooth occurs in the diastema of adult mice carrying mutations in either Spry2 or Spry4. In the case of Spry2 mutants, the origin of the supernumerary tooth involves the revitalization of a rudimentary tooth bud (called R2), whereas its origin in the Spry4 mutants is not known. In addition to R2, another rudimentary primordium (called MS) arises more anteriorly in the prospective diastema. We investigated the participation of both rudiments (MS and R2) in supernumerary tooth development in Spry2 and Spry4 mutants by comparing morphogenesis, proliferation, apoptosis, size and Shh expression in the dental epithelium of MS and R2 rudiments. Increased proliferation and Decemberreased apoptosis were found in MS and R2 at embryonic day (ED) 12.5 and 13.5 in Spry2-/- embryos. Apoptosis was also Decemberreased in both rudiments in Spry4-/- embryos, but the proliferation was lower (similar to WT mice), and supernumerary tooth development was accelerated, exhibiting a cap stage by ED13.5. Compared to Spry2-/- mice, a high number of Spry4-/- supernumerary tooth primordia degenerated after ED13.5, resulting in a low percentage of supernumerary teeth in adults. We propose that Sprouty genes were implicated during evolution in reduction of the cheek teeth in Muridae, and their deletion can reveal ancestral stages of murine dental evolution. J. Exp. Zool.

Several studies have documented the existence of ample genetic variation in sperm competitive ability of males. However, many experimental evolution studies have found sperm competitive ability to be unresponsive to selection. Even direct selection for increased sperm competitive ability has failed to yield any measurable changes. Here we report the evolution of sperm competitive ability (sperm defense-P1, offense-P2) in a set of replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster subjected to altered levels of male-male competition (generated by varying the operational sex ratio) for 55-60 generations. Males from populations with female-biased operational sex ratio evolved reduced P1 and P2, without any measurable change in the male reproductive behavior. Males in the male-biased regime evolved increased P1, but there was no significant change in P2. Increase in P1 was associated with an increase in copulation duration, possibly indicating greater ejaculate investment by these males. This study is one of the few to provide empirical evidence for the evolution of sperm competitive ability of males under different levels of male-male competition.

This study examined phylogenetic host specificity of Frankia in field-collected nodules of two Alnus species (A.tenuifolia and A.viridis) in interior Alaska and, for A.tenuifolia, distribution, diversity, spatial autocorrelation and correlation with specific soil factors of Frankia genotypes in nodules collected from replicated habitats representing endpoints of a priMarchy sere. Frankia genotypes most commonly associated with each host belonged to different clades within the Alnus-infective Frankia clade, and for A.tenuifolia, were divergent from previously described Frankia. A.tenuifolia nodules from early and late succession habitats harboured distinct Frankia assemblages. In early succession, a single genotype inhabited 71% of nodules with no discernable autocorrelation at any scale, while late succession Frankia were more diverse, differed widely among plants within a site and were significantly autocorrelated within and among plants. Early succession Frankia genotype occurrence was strongly correlated with carbon/nitrogen ratio in the mineral soil fraction, while in late succession, the most common genotypes were correlated with different soil variables. Our results suggest that phylogenetic specificity is a significant factor in the A.tenuifolia-Frankia interaction and that significant habitat-based differentiation may exist among A.tenuifolia-infective genotypes. This is consistent with our hypothesis that A.tenuifolia selects specific Frankia genotypes from early succession soils and that this choice is attenuated in late succession.

However, no link has been established between the recurrent accumulation of STRs and increased mutation rates in specific regions of the plant mtDNA genome. Herein, we surveyed this possibility by comparing, in a phylogenetic context, the variation of a STR-rich mitochondrial intron (nad5-4) with eleven mtDNA genes devoid of STRs within Abies (Pinaceae) and its related genera. This intron has been accumulating repeated stretches, generated by at least three-independent insertions, before the split of the two Pinaceae subfamilies, Abietoideae and Pinoideae. The last of these insertions occurred before the divergence of Abies and produced, exclusively within this genus, a tenfold increase of both the indel and substitution rates in the STR hotspot of the intron. The regions flanking the STRs harbored mutation rates as low as those estimated in mitochondrial genes devoid of repeated stretches. Further searches in complete plant mtDNA genomes, and previous studies reporting polymorphic mtSTRs, revealed that repeated stretches are common in all sorts of plants, but their accumulation in STR hotspots appears to be taxa specific. Our study suggests a new mutagenic role for repeated sequences in the plant mtDNA.

Before the end of the last century a great variety of morphometric tools were on offer to deal with this data type, including diverse analyses of distance from a central point, eigenshape analysis of a carefully normalized tangent angle function, and Procrustes analysis of configurations of sliding semilandMarchks. For the special case of outline forms that are nominally bilaterally symmetric, this paper offers a hybrid approach that fuses the Procrustes toolkit with a variant of a much older method, analysis of radial distance according to angles out of a center. The synthesis represents each outline as a regularly resampled data set of radially aligned shape coordinates analogous to bilateral Procrustes shape coordinates. When the center is iteratively located in one particular way, this representation has the same Procrustes distance statistics as a conventional radial representation, while the formalism of shape coordinates permits symmetrization, localizability, and thin-plate spline visualizations. We explain the method and sketch some of its advantages and limitations in the course of an example involving 99 Baculites inornatus outlines spanning 90 m of deposits from a high-precision measured section in the Campanian-age Rosario Formation cropping out at Punta San Jose, Baja California. This sequence shows substantial changes of pole curvature over time, changes that may involve a punctuation event regarding hydrostatics, hydrodynamics, or defense against predators. A concluding comment deals with implications of the developments here for Baculites microevolution and for morphometrics.

Molecular clocks can be calibrated using temporal information from ancient DNA sequences. This information comes from the ages of the ancient samples, which can be estimated by radiocarbon dating the source material or by dating the layers in which the material was deposited. Both methods involve sources of uncertainty. The performance of Bayesian phylogenetic inference depends on the information content of the data set, which includes variation in the DNA sequences and the structure of the sample ages. Various sources of estimation error can reduce our ability to estimate rates and timescales accurately and precisely. We investigated the impact of sample-dating uncertainties on the estimation of evolutionary timescale parameters using the software BEAST. Our analyses involved 11 published data sets and focused on estimates of substitution rate and root age. We show that, provided that samples have been accurately dated and have a broad temporal span, it might be unnecessary to account for sample-dating uncertainty in Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of ancient DNA. We also investigated the sample size and temporal span of the ancient DNA sequences needed to estimate phylogenetic timescales reliably. Our results show that the range of sample ages plays a crucial role in determining the quality of the results but that accurate and precise phylogenetic estimates of timescales can be made even with only a few ancient sequences. These findings have important practical consequences for studies of molecular rates, timescales, and population dynamics.

It is also of interest to determine whether one trait evolves at a faster rate than another trait. However, to date no study has compared phylogenetic evolutionary rates between traits using likelihood, because a formal approach has not yet been proposed. In this article, I describe a new likelihood procedure for comparing evolutionary rates for two or more phenotypic traits on a phylogeny. This approach compares the likelihood of a model where each trait evolves at a distinct evolutionary rate to the likelihood of a model where all traits are constrained to evolve at a common evolutionary rate. The method can also account for within-species measurement error and within-species trait covariation if available. Simulations revealed that the method has appropriate Type I error rates and statistical power. Importantly, when compared with existing approaches based on phylogenetically independent contrasts and methods that compare confidence intervals for model parameters, the likelihood method displays preferable statistical properties for a wide range of simulated conditions. Thus, this likelihood-based method extends the phylogenetic comparative biology toolkit and provides evolutionary biologists with a more powerful means of determining when evolutionary rates differ between phenotypic traits. Finally, I provide an empirical example illustrating the approach by comparing rates of evolution for several phenotypic traits in Plethodon salamanders.

How enemies foster trait diversification and arsenal assembly depends on which selective mode they impose: whether different enemies select for the same defense or exert conflicting selection on a prey species. Theory has long supposed that the selective advantage of a defense depends on its efficacy against a broad spectrum of enemies, which implies that predator selection is more diffuse than pairwise. Here, we use the multi-trait defense arsenal of the tortoise beetle, Acromis sparsa, which consists of shields, gregariousness and maternal guarding to test whether: (1) diverse enemies have selected for narrowly targeted defenses in the Acromis lineage (2) newer traits out-performed older ones or vice versa, and (3) if selection by different enemies results in positive (escalation) trends in defense effectiveness. Because their defenses could be modified or ablated, individuals were rendered differentially protected, and their survival was quantified in a long-term field study. Exclusion experiments evaluated defense efficacy against particular enemy guilds. Logit regression revealed that: (1)no single trait increased survival against the entire enemy suite (2)trait efficacy was strongly correlated with a particular enemy, consistent with narrow targeting (3)traits lacked strong cross-resistance among enemies (4)traits performed synergistically, consistent with the idea of escalation, and (5)traits interacted negatively to Decemberrease survival, indicative of performance trade-offs. From collation of the phylogenetic histories of arsenal and enemy community assembly we hypothesize that older traits performed better against older enemies and that patterns of both trait and enemy accumulation are consistent with defense escalation. Trade-offs and lack of cross-resistance among defenses imply that enemy selection has been conflicting at the guild level and that negative functional interactions among defenses have fostered the evolution of a defense arsenal of increasing complexity.

Such hidden storage of genetic diversity need not be exclusive to dormant banks. Genotype diversity may be preserved in many iteroparous animals through sperm-storage mechanisms in females. This allows males to reproduce posthumously and increase the effective sizes of seemingly female-biased populations. Although long-term sperm storage has been demonstrated in many organisms, the understanding of its importance in the wild is very poor. We here show the prevalence of male posthumous reproduction in wild Trinidadian guppies, through the combination of Marchk-recapture and pedigree analyses of a multigenerational individual-based dataset. A significant proportion of the reproductive population consisted of dead males, who could conceive up to 10 months after death (the maximum allowed by the length of the dataset), which is more than twice the estimated generation time. Demographic analysis shows that the fecundity of dead males can play an important role in population growth and selection.

A linkage map was recently published for Rana temporaria (Linnaeus, 1758) from Fennoscandia (Eastern European lineage), with a proposed sex-determining role for linkage group 2 (LG2). We analysed linkage patterns in lowland and highland populations from Switzerland (Western European lineage), with special focus on LG2. Sibship analyses showed large differences from the Fennoscandian map in terms of recombination rates and loci order, pointing to large-scale inversions or translocations. All linkage groups displayed extreme heterochiasmy (total map length was 12.2cM in males, versus 869.8cM in females). Sex determination was polymorphic within populations: a majority of families (with equal sex ratios) showed a strong correlation between offspring phenotypic sex and LG2 paternal haplotypes, whereas other families (some of which with female-biased sex ratios) did not show any correlation. The factors determining sex in the latter could not be identified. This coexistence of several sex-determination systems should induce frequent recombination of X and Y haplotypes, even in the absence of male recombination. Accordingly, we found no sex differences in allelic frequencies on LG2 Marchkers among wild-cAugustht male and female adults, except in one high-altitude population, where nonrecombinant Y haplotypes suggest sex to be entirely determined by LG2. Multifactorial sex determination certainly contributes to the lack of sex-chromosome differentiation in amphibians.

Empirical evidence supports a role for frequent turNovemberers, which replace nonrecombining sex chromosomes before they have time to Decemberay. Three main mechanisms have been proposed for such turNovemberers, relying either on neutral processes, sex-ratio selection, or intrinsic benefits of the new sex-determining genes (due, e.g., to linkage with sexually antagonistic mutations). Here, we suggest an additional mechanism, arising from the load of deleterious mutations that accumulate on nonrecombining sex chromosomes. In the absence of dosage compensation, this load should progressively lower survival rate in the heterogametic sex. TurNovemberers should occur when this cost outweighs the benefits gained from any sexually antagonistic genes carried by the nonrecombining sex chromosome. We use individual-based simulations of a Muller's ratchet process to test this prediction, and investigate how the relevant parameters (effective population size, strength and dominance of deleterious mutations, size of nonrecombining segment, and strength of sexually antagonistic selection) are expected to affect the rate of turNovemberers.

Often individuals of one sex are more likely to become helpers at the nest. We analyze how such sex-biased offspring helping can influence sex-ratio evolution. It is essential to account for age-structure because the sex ratios of early broods influence how much help is available for later broods previous authors have not correctly accounted for this fact. When each female produces the same sex ratio in all broods (as assumed in all previous analyses of sex-biased helping), the optimal investment strategy is biased towards the more-helpful sex. When a female has facultative control over the sex ratio in each brood and each helper of a given sex increases the resource available for offspring production by a fixed amount, the optimal strategy is to produce only the more-helpful sex in early broods and only the less-helpful sex in later broods. When there are nonlinear returns from helping, i.e., each helper increases the amount of resource available for reproduction by an amount dependent upon the number of helpers, the optimal strategy is to maximize resource accrual from helping in early broods (which may involve the production of both sexes) and then switch to the exclusive production of the less-helpful sex in later broods. The population sex ratio is biased towards the more-helpful sex regardless of whether the sex ratio is fixed or age-dependent. When fitness returns from helping exhibit environmental patchiness, females are selected to produce only males on some patches and only females on others, and the population sex ratio may be biased in either direction. We discuss our results in light of empirical information on offspring helping, and we show via meta-analysis that there is no support for the claim of Griffin et al. [Griffin, AS., Sheldon, B.C., West, S.A., 2005. Cooperative breeders adjust offspring sex ratios to produce helpful helpers. Amer. Nat. 166,628-632] that parents produce more of the helpful sex when that sex is rare or absent. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although they may be unstable against temperature fluctuations and other environmental changes, ligase ribozymes (ribozymes with RNA strand-joining activity) may resolve structural instability of self-assembling RNAs by converting them to the corresponding unimolecular formats. To investigate this possibility, we constructed a model system using a cross-ligation system composed of a pair of self-assembling ligase ribozymes. Their abilities to act as catalysts, substrates, and a cross-ligation system were analyzed with or without thermal pretreatment before the reactions. A pair of self-assembling ligase ribozymes, each of which can form multiple conformations, demonstrated that thermotolerance was acquired and accumulated through complex-formation that stabilized the active forms of the bimolecular ribozymes and also cross-ligation that produced the unimolecular ribozymes.

While the remainder of the genome is largely homoallelic, this region of recombinational suppression, extending over 1500 genes, is associated with sequence divergence. Here, we used microarrays to examine how the molecular phenotype of gene expression level is linked to this divergent region, and thus to the mating type. Culturing N. tetrasperma on agar media that induce sexual/female or vegetative/male tissue, we found 196 genes significantly differentially expressed between mat A and mat a mating types. Our data show that the genes exhibiting mat-linked expression are enriched in the region genetically linked to mating type, and sequence and expression divergence are positively correlated. Our results indicate that the phenotype of mat A strains is optimized for traits promoting sexual/female development and the phenotype of mat a strains for vegetative/male development. This discovery of differentially expressed genes associated with mating type provides a link between genotypic and phenotypic divergence in this taxon and illustrates a fungal analogue to sexual dimorphism found among animals and plants.

For this reason, an animal's body mass likely has a significant effect on the shape of its limb bones. In the present study, we investigate the influence of body mass variation on the shape of the three long bones of the forelimb in a group of closely-related species of mammals: the musteloid carnivorans. We use geometric morphometric techniques to quantify forelimb shape then estimate phylogenetic signal in the shape of each long bone and, finally, we apply an independent contrasts approach to assess evolutionary associations between forelimb shape and body mass. The results obtained show that body mass evolution is tightly coordinated with the evolution of forelimb shape, although not equally in all elements. In particular, the humeral and radial shapes of heavier species appear better suited for load bearing and load transmission than the ulna. Nevertheless, our results also show that body mass influences only part of forelimb long bone shape and that other factors, such as locomotor ecology, must be considered to fully understand forelimb evolution.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 91-103.

Mammals and birds belong to different amniote groups (Synapsida and Diapsida, respectively), but exhibit common general features in their glial architecture, mainly the predominance of astrocytes. Two vertebrate groups seem to be in special positions of glial evolution: turtles (Testudiniformes) and skates and rays (Batoidea). The purely ependymoglial system of turtles seems to be the simplest one among the extant amniotes. In skates and rays, true astrocytes are preponderant glial elements, in contrast to the other anamniotes (and even to reptiles). We investigated stab wounds by the immunohistochemical detection of GFAP in turtles (Trachemysformerly Pseudemysscripta elegans), a skate (Raja clavata) and rays (Dasyatis akajei and Torpedo Marchmorata). Sharks (Scyliorhinus canicula) as ependymoglia-predominated chondrichthyans, andfor positive controlsrats were also studied. In the elasmobranchs, other astroglial Marchkers: glutamine synthetase and S100 protein were also applied. Neither turtles nor elasmobranchs presented considerable astroglial reactions. Critically surveying the former reports on different vertebrates, these results complete the picture that typical post-lesion reactive gliosis is confined to mammals and birds. Analysis of the astroglial systems from phylogenetic perspective suggests that the capability of forming glial deMarchcation and scar formation evolved independently in mammals and birds. Predominance of astrocytes is a necessary condition but not sufficient for reactive gliosis. The intense glial reactivity of mammals and birds may be attributed to their complex cerebralization. J.

ELEGANS PHEROMONE EVOLUTION BEHAVIOR PREFERENCE DISPERSAL PATHWAYS NEMATODE REVEALS	In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the appropriate induction of dauer larvae development within growing populations is likely to be a priMarchy determinant of genotypic fitness. The underlying genetic architecture of natural genetic variation in dauer formation has, however, not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we report extensive natural genetic variation in dauer larvae development within growing populations across multiple wild isolates. Moreover, bin mapping of introgression lines (ILs) derived from the genetically divergent isolates N2 and CB4856 reveals 10 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting dauer formation. Comparison of individual ILs to N2 identifies an additional eight QTLs, and sequential IL analysis reveals six more QTLs. Our results also show that a behavioural, laboratory-derived, mutation controlled by the neuropeptide Y receptor homolog npr-1 can affect dauer larvae development in growing populations. These findings illustrate the complex genetic architecture of variation in dauer larvae formation in C. elegans and may help to understand how the control of variation in dauer larvae development has evolved.

Data matrices (6.4kbp) are analysed using parsimony and model-based methods (maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference). Our results support the family NOctoberuidae as a monophyletic group in which most subfamilies have hindwing vein M2 reduced or absent. Our phylogenetic hypothesis suggests that in the NOctoberuidae, the plesiomorphic condition is that in which vein M2 arises about one-third of the way up the discocellular vein between the origins of M1 and M3, mainly parallel to M3, and is of thickness similar to vein M3. Most NOctoberuidae lineages possess an apomorphic (derived) condition in which hindwing vein M2 is Marchkedly reduced or totally absent, so that the cubital vein appears to be three-branched and these lineages are hence referred to as trifine'. However, NOctoberuidae also include a number of lineages in which vein M2 is unreduced, or only slightly reduced, and these are more problematic for morphological association with the family NOctoberuidae. Our results also show that the subfamily Acronictinae is not closely related to Pantheinae, but instead shows a closer association with Amphipyrinae. Among the major lineages of NOctoberuidae, we postulate a general trend, with numerous exceptions, in larval host plants from woody plants in the basal groups towards herb feeding in derived groups. Similarly, the major radiations of monocot-feeding groups within the family NOctoberuidae are in the higher trifines. The following taxonomic changes are proposed: Thiacidinae, syn. November., a Juneior synonym of Pantheinae, and Dyopsinae, stat. November., are reinstated as a subfamily.

O1v(G542A) was previously reported in Native American populations in Mesoamerica and South America, and has been proposed as an ancestry informative Marchker. We investigated whether this allele is also found in the Tlingit and Haida, two contemporary indigenous populations from Alaska, and a pre-Columbian population from California. If O1v(G542A) is present in Na-Dene speakers (i.e., Tlingits), it would indicate that Na-Dene speaking groups share close ancestry with other Native American groups and support a Beringian origin of the allele, consistent with the Beringian Incubation Model. If O1v(G542A) is found in pre-Columbian populations, it would further support a Beringian origin of the allele, rather than a more recent introduction of the allele into the Americas via gene flow from one or more populations which have admixed with Native Americans over the past five centuries. We identified this allele in one Na-Dene population at a frequency of 0.11, and one ancient California population at a frequency of 0.20. Our results support a Beringian origin of O1v(G542A), which is distributed today among all Native American groups that have been geno-typed in appreciable numbers at this locus. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that Na-Dene and other Native American populations priMarchily derive their ancestry from a single source population.

With a wide geographic sampling comprising 90 localities and including more than 180 individuals, we conducted species delimitation analyses with a Maximum Likelihood approach that uses a mixed Yule-coalescent model to detect species boundaries. We estimated molecular phylogenetic relationships employing Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference methods using mitochondria] and nuclear sequences. We conducted divergence time analyses using a relaxed clock model implemented in BEAST. Our results recovered 12 species that form four groups: Lycosa tarantula group comprising L tarantula the type species of the genus, L. hispanica and L bedeli Lycosa oculata group composed of L. oculata, L. suboculata and three putative new species Lycosa baulnyi group formed by the maghrebian L. baulnyi and L. vachoni and Lycosa fasciiventris group that includes two widespread species, L. fasciiventris and L munieri. We found that each group of species shows a characteristic burrowing behavior and molecular and morphological diagnostic characters. Molecular clock analyses support the hypothesis of a relatively recent evolutionary origin of diversification of the group (4.96 Mya (3.53-6.45 Mya)). The establishment of the Mediterranean-like climate and the Pleistocenic glacial cycles seem to have been the main factors that promoted the diversification within the group. Finally, the results obtained in this study together with the revision of museum specimens, descriptions, redescriptions and illustrations, lead us to propose 18 nomenclatural changes (synonymies, generic transfers and nomina dubia) concerning the genera Lycosa, Allocosa and Hogna in the Western Mediterranean.

Alignment masking, the elimination of phylogenetically uninformative or misleading sites from an alignment before phylogenetic analysis, is a common practice in phylogenetic analysis. Although masking is often done manually, automated methods are necessary to handle the much larger data sets being prepared today. In this study, we introduce the concept of subsplits and demonstrate their use in extracting phylogenetic signal from alignments. We design a clustering approach for alignment masking where each cluster contains similar columns-similarity being defined on the basis of compatible subsplits our approach then identifies noisy clusters and eliminates them. Trees inferred from the columns in the retained clusters are found to be topologically closer to the reference trees. We test our method on numerous standard benchMarchks (both synthetic and biological data sets) and compare its performance with other methods of alignment masking. We find that our method can eliminate sites more accurately than other methods, particularly on divergent data, and can improve the topologies of the inferred trees in likelihood-based analyses.

Particularly, the morphology of male genital structures is considered to be among the fastest evolving traits in animal groups with internal fertilization. In this study, we investigated patterns of male genital variation within and between natural populations of the cactophilic fly Drosophila buzzatii in its original geographic distribution range in the Neotropics. We detected significant morphological differences among populations and distinguished five differentiated groups. Moreover, among population differentiation in genital morphology was associated with the degree of geographic isolation among populations and clearly contrasted with the general homogeneity detected for the putatively neutral mitochondrial gene COI. Integrating our present data with previous molecular population genetic surveys, our results suggest that male genital morphology has rapidly diverged after the recent demographic expansion that D. buzzatii has undergone in the arid zones of South America. Because the lock and key hypothesis failed to explain the present pattern, we explored alternative explanations for the observed pattern of genital diversification including drift-facilitated sexual selection.

The presence, homology and evolution of characters in major subgroups thus need to be reinvestigated. Traditionally basal opisthobranch Cephalaspidea (head-shield snails and slugs) were pruned to a new taxon concept, with benthic euopisthobranch and tentacle-bearing cephalaspidean lineages basal to burrowing, head-shield bearing philinoidean species. Among the latter, mesopsammic microslug lineages evolved at least twice. Herein we explore in 3D microanatomical detail the putatively basal philinoglossan Pluscula cuica (Marchcus, Boletim da Faculdade de Filosofia, Cincias e Letras. Universidade de So Paulo 164:165-203, 1953a) from its type locality in Brazil. The species possesses several accessory ganglia and a reduced posterior mantle cavity that retains some putative shell-building tissue and an osphradium. The hermaphroditic, monaulic genital system opens in a posterior position it retains a bursa copulatrix but lacks a distinct receptaculum seminis. Autosperm is transferred to the cephalic copulatory organ via an external sperm groove, not through the hemocoel, as suggested in the original description. The penis opens through the oral tube, sperm is transferred by a kiss. A conspicuous yellow gland is discussed as a modified Blochmann's gland. Retaining several putative symplesiomorphies with philinoids, Pluscula is discussed as the most basal offshoot in meiofaunal Philinoglossidae. However, the supposed primitiveness of the fused rather than Septemberarate cerebropleural ganglia and the triganglionate rather than pentaganglionate visceral nerve cord was based on misobservations. Higher categories such as Philinoglossacea for Philinoglossidae, and a Septemberarate family Plusculidae for P. cuica are no longer warranted. Inner cephalaspidean relationships and a scenario of more or less successive philinoglossid adaptation to meiofaunal environments should be investigated by molecular studies with more comprehensive taxon sampling.

We here show that in the beetle genus Altica, infection has influenced phylogenetic patterns of the host's mtDNA and different strains led to repeated selective sweeps. By comparing a COI/II-based phylogeny of the hosts with a phylogeny of the bacteria based on ftsZ, we show that cospeciation is rare and restricted to few recently diverged species. While in general each species apparently harbours a single Wolbachia strain, Altica lythri presents a strikingly different pattern: in the polyphyletic species, three highly divergent mtDNA haplotypes (2.1-4.6% p-distance) are coupled with three different Wolbachia strains (wLytA1, wLytA2 and wLytB). These haplotypes and Wolbachia strains are widely distributed and mostly found in sympatry. A phylogeny based on microsatellite data supports the monophyly of A. lythri. The discrepancy between mtDNA and nuclear phylogeny may best be explained by interspecific hybridization that led to introgression of mtDNA coupled with a different Wolbachia strain. Selective sweeps apparently drove the introgressed haplotypes to widespread distribution. As for effects of Wolbachia on reproduction, infection with wLytA1 appears to be correlated with a substantial sex ratio distortion, which was most prominent in A. lythri.

The Xiphorhynchus pardalotus/ocellatus species complex includes between two to three polytypic species and eight to nine subspecies distributed throughout most of lowland Amazonia and the foothills of the eastern Andes. To understand its historical diversification and address the main unsettled issues of phylogenetic relationships and taxonomy, we apply several approaches using data from two mitochondrial (Cyt b and ND2) and three nuclear genes (beta-fibint7, CPZint3 and CRYAAint1) for all described species and most subspecies of this complex. We compared single gene trees with a multilocus concatenated tree and Bayesian species tree inferred under a coalescent framework (*BEAST). Our results showed a general pattern of incongruence among gene trees and multilocus trees. Despite of this, the coalescent-based species tree analysis supports the sister-taxa relationship of X ocellatus and X. chunchotambo, while X. pardalotus comes out as the basal taxon. With exception of the last, our results revealed within both X. ocellatus and X. chunchotambo high levels of genetic differentiation (p-distances 0.5-5.5%) with well-supported lineages. Our phylogenetic analyses showed several incongruences with current subspecies taxonomy, revealing that X. o. ocellatus is paraphyletic relative to X. o. petplexus, and the currently recognized subspecies X. c. napensis corresponds to two distinct evolutionary lineages, which are not supported as sister-lineages. In addition, the deep level of genetic divergence between X. o. beauperthuysii and the extant subspecies of X. ocellatus is more consistent with species-level differences found in this complex. Divergence time estimates were consistent with a historical scenario of intense population subdivision and speciation during the Early-mid Pleistocene. The spatial pattern and timing of diversification overlap broadly with that reported for other Amazonian vertebrate lineages. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Intriguingly, a resistance allele pre-existing in a population often bears a series of further adaptive allelic variants through new mutations. This phenomenon occasionally results in replacement of the predominating resistance allele by fitter new derivatives, and consequently, development of greater resistance at the population level. The overexpression of the cytochrome P450 gene CYP9M10 is associated with pyrethroid resistance in the southern house mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus. Previously, we have found two genealogically related overexpressing CYP9M10 haplotypes, which differ in gene copy number (duplicated and non-duplicated). The duplicated haplotype was derived from the non-duplicated overproducer probably recently. In the present study, we investigated allelic series of CYP9M10 involved in three C. quinquefasciatus laboratory colonies recently collected from three different localities. Duplicated and non-duplicated overproducing haplotypes coexisted in African and Asian colonies indicating a global distribution of both haplotype lineages. The duplicated haplotypes both in the Asian and African colonies were associated with higher expression levels and stronger resistance than non-duplicated overproducing haplotypes. There were slight variation in expression level among the non-duplicated overproducing haplotypes. The nucleotide sequences in coding and upstream regions among members of this group also showed a little diversity. Non-duplicated overproducing haplotypes with relatively higher expression were genealogically closer to the duplicated haplotypes than the other non-duplicated overproducing haplotypes, suggesting multiple cis-acting mutations before duplication.

Here we use standard phylogenetic and parsimony network analyses on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Cox1, ITS1) of 230 individuals from 65 European sampling sites in order to deduce population structure of Cetonia beetles from geno- and haplotypes. Statistical measures of population differentiation are inferred on genealogical and geographical scales to test hypotheses about species limits and population history. By combining results of phylogenetic structure with features of morphology, including genital shape morphometrics and discrete external body characters, as well as with measures of population genetics, we attempt to integrate the results as a test of the validity of species limits, in particular of currently recognised subspecies. Despite high Cox1 divergence between some haplotype lineages, even some sympatric lineages (9%, e.g. N2 vs. N4), nDNA and morphology, as well as pattern of geographical and genealogical divergence measured by AMOVA analysis did not support the hypothesis of Septemberarate species. Highest divergence in nuclear Marchkers was found among Italian populations of C. aurata pisana and C. a. sicula, and moderately high fixation indices along measurable morphological divergence suggest the correctness of their status as 'subspecies'. Divergence time estimates of the lineages suggest a glacial divergence in different refugia between the major haplogroups, while population differentiation in mtDNA among these was priMarchily attributable to restricted gene flow caused by geographic isolation.

Comparative studies of genetic structure can provide insights into how habitat fragmentation contributes to patterns of genetic divergence among populations of the interacting species. In this study, we used microsatellites to analyse genetic variation in Chinese populations of a typical mutualistic system - Ficus pumila and its obligate pollinator Wiebesia sp. 1 - in a naturally fragmented landscape. The plants and wasps showed discordant patterns of genetic variation and geographical divergence. There was no significant positive relationship in genetic diversity between the two species. Significant isolation-by-distance (IBD) patterns occurred across the populations of F.pumila and Wiebesia sp. 1 as whole, and IBD also occurred among island populations of the wasps, but not the plants. However, there was no significant positive relationship in genetic differentiation between them. The pollinator populations had significantly lower genetic variation in small habitat patches than in larger patches, and three island pollinator populations showed evidence of a recent bottleneck event. No effects of patch size or genetic bottlenecks were evident in the plant populations. Collectively, the results indicate that, in more fragmented habitats, the pollinators, but not the plants, have experienced reduced genetic variation. The contrasting patterns have multiple potential causes, including differences in longevity and hence number of generations experiencing fragmentation different dispersal patterns, with the host's genes dispersed as seeds as well as a result of pollen dispersal via the pollinator asymmetrical responses to fluctuations in partner populations and co-existence of a rare second pollinating wasp on some islands. These results indicate that strongly interdependent species may respond in Marchkedly different ways to habitat fragmentation.

Competition is often conceptualized as being exploitative (indirect) or involving direct interference. However, most empirical studies are phenomenological, focusing on quantifying effects of density manipulations, and most competition theory has characterized exploitation competition systems. The effects on resource use of traits associated with direct, interference competition has received far less attention. Here we examine the relationships of dietary ecology and phylogeny to heterospecific aggression in a guild of corallivorous reef fishes. We find that, among chaetodontids (butterflyfishes), heterospecific aggression depends on a synergistic interaction of dietary overlap and specialization: aggression increases with dietary overlap for interactions between specialists but not for interactions involving generalists. Moreover, behavioral dominance is a monotonically increasing function of dietary specialization. The strong, positive relationship of dominance to specialization suggests that heterospecific aggression may contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity where it promotes resource partitioning. Additionally, we find strong phylogenetic signals in dietary overlap and specialization but not behavioral dominance. Our results support the use of phylogeny as a proxy for ecological similarity among butterflyfishes, but we find that direct measures of dietary overlap and specialization predict heterospecific agression much better than phylogeny.

Interspersed repeats result from successive replication by transposable elements, such as Alu and long interspersed element type 1 (L1). Microsatellites are tandem repeats of 1-6 base pairs, among which poly(A) microsatellites are the most abundant in the human genome. The rise and fall of a microsatellite has been depicted as a life cycle. Previous studies have demonstrated that Alu and L1 insertions are a major source of A-rich microsatellites owing to the concurrent formation of a poly(A) DNA tract at the 3'-end of each insertion. The fate of such poly(A) tracts has been studied by surveying the length distribution of genomic resident Alu and L1 insertions. However, these cross-sectional studies provide no information about the tempo of mutation immediately after birth. In this study, de Novembero L1 insertions were created using a transgenic L1 mouse model and traced through generations to investigate the early life of poly(A) microsatellites. High frequencies of intra-individual and intergenerational shortening were observed for long poly(A) tracts, creating somatic and germline mosaicism at the insertion site, whereas little variation was observed for short poly(A) alleles. As poly(A) microsatellites are the major intrinsic signal for nucleosome positioning, their reMarchkable abundance and variability make them a significant source of epigenetic variation. Thus, the birth of poly(A) microsatellites from retrotransposons and the subsequent rapid and variable shortening represent a new way with which retrotransposons can modify the genetic and epigenetic architecture of our genome.

Both hybridization and ancestral polymorphism have been invoked to explain divergent phylogenies inferred from different datasets for Stigmacerca, a clade of 11 North American darter species. Species of Stigmacerca are characterized by a mating system involving parental care with males guarding nesting territories and fertilized eggs. Males of four species of Stigmacerca develop egg-mimic nuptial structures on their second dorsal fins during the breeding season. Previous phylogenies suggest contrasting scenarios for the evolution of this nuptial trait. Using a combination of coalescent-based methods, we analyzed a dataset comprising a mitochondrial gene and 15 nuclear loci to estimate relationships and simultaneously test for introgressive hybridization. Our analyses identified several instances of interspecific gene flow involving both cytoplamsmic haplotypes and nuclear alleles. The new phylogeny was used to infer a single origin and recent loss of egg-mimic structures in Stigmacerca and led to the discovery of a phylogenetically distinct species. Our results highlight the limited strategies available to account for introgressive hybridization in the inference of species relationships and the likely effects of this process on reconstructing trait evolution.

However, relatively little is known about how evolutionary processes vary over the course of an invasion. To evaluate the importance of historical and adaptive drivers of range expansion, we compare the performance of North American populations of invasive Lonicera japonica from areas established 100150 years ago, now the southern core of the range, to populations from the northern range Marchgin, established within the last 65 years. Growth and survival of individuals from 17 core and 14 Marchgin populations were compared in common gardens at both regions. After three years, Marchgin plants were larger than core plants regardless of planting region, with 34% more branches and 36% greater biomass. Growth rate was directly related to survival, and Marchgin plants also had 30% greater survival than core plants across both regions. Larger size of individuals from Marchgin populations suggests either that the shorter growing period at the northern Marchgin has selected for more rapid growth or that range expansion has selected for plants with a greater colonizing ability, including rapid establishment and growth. Because this evolution has resulted in enhanced survival and increased growth rate it may drive spread, increasing the likelihood of further invasion.

However, the environmental factors that cause evolutionary divergence in invasive species are poorly understood. We developed predictions for how different life-history traits, and plasticity in those traits, may respond to environmental gradients in seasonal temperatures, season length and natural enemies. We then tested these predictions in four geographic populations of the invasive cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae) from North America. We examined the influence of two rearing temperatures (20 and 26.7 degrees C) on pupal mass, pupal development time, immune function and fecundity. As predicted, development time was shorter and immune function was greater in populations adapted to longer season length. Also, phenotypic plasticity in development time was greater in regions with shorter growing seasons. Populations differed significantly in mean and plasticity of body mass and fecundity, but these differences were not associated with seasonal temperatures or season length. Our study shows that some life-history traits, such as development time and immune function, can evolve rapidly in response to latitudinal variation in season length and natural enemies, whereas others traits did not. Our results also indicate that phenotypic plasticity in development time can also diverge rapidly in response to environmental conditions for some traits.

While the ecological processes that contribute to the successful establishment of invasive plants have been studied in detail, investigation of the evolutionary processes involved in successful invasions has only recently received attention. In particular, studies investigating the genomic and gene expression differences between native and introduced populations of invasive species are just beginning and are required if we are to understand how plants become invasive. In the current issue of Molecular Ecology, Hodgins etal. () tackle this unresolved question, by examining gene expression differences between native and introduced populations of annual ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia. The study identifies a number of potential candidate genes based on gene expression differences that may be responsible for the success of annual ragweed in its introduced range. Furthermore, genes involved in stress response are over-represented in the differentially expressed gene set. Future experiments could use functional studies to test whether changes in gene expression at these candidate genes do in fact underlie changes in growth characteristics and reproductive output observed in this and other invasive species.

New molecular genetic and genomic techniques are available and accessible, but have been grossly underutilized in studies of invertebrate pest invasions, despite that they are useful tools for applied pest management and for understanding fundamental features of pest invasions including pest population demographics and adaptation of pests to Novemberel and/or changing environments. Here, we review current applications of molecular genetics and genomics in the study of invertebrate pest invasions and outbreaks, and we highlight shortcomings from the current body of research. We then discuss recent conceptual and methodological advances in the areas of molecular genetics/genomics and data analysis, and we highlight how these advances will further our understanding of the demographic, ecological, and evolutionary features of invertebrate pest invasions. We are now well equipped to use molecular data to understand invertebrate dispersal and adaptation, and this knowledge has valuable applications in agriculture at a time when these are critically required.

But a lack of data has prevented the investigation of this hypothesis in most plastid-bearing protists. Here, using newly sequenced mitochondrial and plastid genomes, we explore the relationship between organelle DNA noncoding content and organism size within volvocine green algae. By looking at unicellular, colonial, and differentiated multicellular algae, we show that organelle DNA complexity scales positively with species size and cell number across the volvocine lineage. Moreover, silent-site genetic diversity data suggest that the volvocine species with the largest cell numbers and most bloated organelle genomes have the smallest effective population sizes. Together, these findings support the view that nonadaptive processes, like random genetic drift, promote the expansion of noncoding regions in organelle genomes.

Here we present the first test of whether MC1R variation is associated with differences in parasite abundance in a natural population. Bananaquits (Coereba flaveola) (Linnaeus, 1758) living on Grenada in the Caribbean exhibit a melanic plumage dimorphism as a result of a mutation in MC1R. The proportion of black individuals increases clinally towards the central, wetter parts of the island. We captured bananaquits through the cline and quantified parasite abundances. Avian malaria, feather mites, and mallophaga lice varied significantly in abundance across the cline however, neither these infections, nor coccidia, nor arboviruses showed overall differences between the morphs. Feather mites tended to be more abundant on black individuals, in areas where the black morph was more common. This may result from differences in microhabitat use by the two morphs. These patterns do not support the idea that MC1R variation in itself results in differing susceptibility to parasites.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London	June 22, 2013The Rate of Molecular Adaptation in a Changing Environment	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	Fisher's geometric model population size adaptive walk extinction amino acid substitution rate	EFFECTIVE POPULATION-SIZE SLIGHTLY DELETERIOUS MUTATIONS ADAPTIVE PROTEIN EVOLUTION PURIFYING SELECTION GENETIC-VARIATION NEUTRAL THEORY DROSOPHILA GENOME FITNESS POLYMORPHISM	It is currently unclear whether the amino acid substitutions that occur during protein evolution are priMarchily driven by adaptation, or reflect the random accumulation of neutral changes. When estimated from genomic data, the proportion of adaptive amino acid substitutions, called alpha, was found to vary greatly across species, from nearly zero in humans to above 0.5 in Drosophila. These variations have been interpreted as reflecting differences in effective population size, adaptation being supposedly more efficient in large populations. Here, we investigate the influence of effective population size and other biological parameters on the rate of adaptive evolution by simulating the evolution of a coding sequence under Fisher's geometric formalism. We explicitly model recurrent environmental changes and the subsequent adaptive walks, followed by periods of stasis during which purifying selection dominates. We show that, under a variety of conditions, the effective population size has only a moderate influence on alpha, and an even weaker influence on the per generation rate of selective sweeps, modifying the prevalent view in current literature. The rate of environmental change and, interestingly, the dimensionality of the phenotypic space (organismal complexity) affect the adaptive rate more deeply than does the effective population size. We discuss the reasons why verbal arguments have been misleading on that subject and revisit the empirical evidence. Our results question the relevance of the alpha parameter as an indicator of the efficiency of molecular adaptation.

In order to investigate how reciprocity of allocare within units of sperm whales facilitates group living, we constructed weighted social networks based on yearly matrices of associations (2005-2010) and correlated them across years, through changes in age and social role, to study changes in social relationships within seven sperm whale units. Pairs of association matrices from sequential years showed a greater positive correlation than expected by chance, but as the time lag increased, the correlation coefficients Decemberreased. Over all units considered, calves had high values for all measured network statistics, while mothers had intermediate values for most of the measures, but high values for connectedness and affinity. Mothers showed sharp drops in strength and connectedness in the first year of their new calves' lives. These broad patterns appear to be consistent across units. Calves appeared to be significant nodes in the network of the social unit, and thus provide quantitative support for the theory in which communal care acts as the evolutionary force behind group formation in this species.

Family Malawispongiidae includes five genera: Malawispongia, Spinospongilla, Cortispongilla, Ochridaspongia, Pachydictyum, which inhabit ancient lakes: Malawi and Tanganyika (African Rift Valley), Kinneret (Middle East), Ohrid (Europe) and Poso (Central Sulawesi). We show via nuclear and mitochondrial Marchkers (cox 1, 28S rRNA and ribosomal ITS regions) that both endemic species Cortispongilla barroisi and Ephydatia syriaca from Lake Kinneret are synonymous with the cosmopolitian species Ephydatia fluviatilis, which also supports suggestions that the family Malawispongiidae is polyphyletic. Our findings also suggest that Nudospongilla is a synthetic taxon and that the number of endemic freshwater sponge species is overestimated.

Yet the reciprocal influence of strategic sex allocation on processes of sexual selection has only recently been revealed. Recent theoretical work demonstrates that sex allocation weakens selection for female preferences, leading to the Decemberline of male traits. However, these results have been derived assuming that females have perfect knowledge of mate attractiveness and precise control over cost-free allocation. Relaxing these assumptions highlights the importance of another feedback: that adaptive sex allocation must become difficult to maintain as traits and preferences Decemberline. When sex allocation strategies erode not only traits and preferences but also their own selective advantage, predictions can no longer be expressed as a simple linear correlation between ornament exaggeration and adaptive sex allocation. Instead, strongest sex ratio biases may be found at intermediate trait levels.

Key among these is paired appendages (fins, legs and wings), which first evolved at some point on the gnathostome stem. The anatomy of fossil stem gnathostomes is, therefore, fundamental to our understanding of the nature and timing of the origin of this complex inNovemberation. Here, we show that Euphanerops, a fossil jawless fish from the Devonian, possessed paired anal-fin radials, but no pectoral or pelvic fins. This unique condition occurs at an early stage on the stem-gnathostome lineage. This condition, and comparison with the varied condition of paired fins in other ostracoderms, indicates that there was a large amount of developmental plasticity during this episode-rather than a gradual evolution of this complex feature. Apparently, a number of different clades were exploring morphospace or undergoing multiple losses.

Reason for this is that several species of similar morphologies are known to occur sympatrically. In the north-west of Iran, four such species occur: Meriones tristrami, Meriones persicus, Meriones vinogradovi and Meriones libycus, prone to several issues of taxonomical ambiguity. A proper characterization of morphological distinctiveness between these species, in relation to the variation within species, could provide the required information for species diagnosis and identification. As some cranial characters of M. tristrami, M. persicus and M. vinogradovi are quite similar, deMarchcations of species-specific phenotypic variation have proven to be difficult. To tackle this problem, this study involves a geometric morphometric analysis of skull shape and size, incorporating a large representative sample of these four species, originating from most parts of their natural distribution range (especially for M. tristrami). It is first tested whether M. tristrami can be distinguished from the other sympatric species, and if so, to what degree the species shows a geoclimatic pattern in its skull shape and size when comparing different populations. The shape and size analyses show that M. libycus can be distinguished because of its largest skull and the relatively largest tympanic bulla, and that M. tristrami can be distinguished from the other species. At an intraspecific level in M. tristrami, the Iranian groups (Qazvin and west Iran) do not differ in shape among them, but do so in skull size. They could, however, be distinguished in skull shape from the non-Iranian populations included (Turkey and Jordan). To what degree this continuous data can now be translated into discrete and diagnostic features, useful for taxonomic purposes, remains to be studied.

Allometric exponents may therefore be hard to change and act as constraints on the independent evolution of traits. In apparent contradiction to this, many empirical studies have concluded that static allometries are evolvable. Many of these studies have been based, however, on a broad definition of allometry that includes any monotonic shape change with size, and do not falsify the hypothesis of constrained narrow-sense allometry. Here, we present the first phylogenetic comparative study of narrow-sense allometric exponents based on a reanalysis of data on eye span and body size in stalk-eyed flies (Diopsidae). Consistent with a role in sexual selection, we found strong evidence that male slopes were tracking optima based on sexual dimorphism and relative male trait size. This tracking was slow, however, with estimated times of 23 million years for adaptation to exceed ancestral influence on the trait. Our results are therefore consistent with adaptive evolution on million-year time scales, but cannot rule out that static allometry may act as a constraint on eye-span adaptation at shorter time scales.

Phylogenetic relationship of 73 accessions of kenaf, roselle and their wild relatives from 15 countries was assessed using 44 inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and jute (Corchorus olitorius L.) specific simple sequence repeats (SSR) Marchkers. A total of 113 alleles were identified of which 61.95 % were polymorphic. Jute specific SSR Marchkers exhibited high polymorphism and resolving power in kenaf, although ISSR Marchkers exhibited higher resolving power than SSR Marchkers. Number of polymorphic alleles varied from 1 to 5 for ISSR and 1 to 6 for SSR Marchkers. Cultivated species exhibited higher allele polymorphism (57 %) than the wild species (35 %), but the improved cultivars exhibited lower genetic diversity compared to germplasm accessions. Accessions with common genetic lineage and geographical distribution clustered together. Indian kenaf varieties were distinct from cultivars bred in other countries and shared more genetic homology with African accessions. High genetic diversity was observed in the Indian (J = 0.35-0.74) and exotic kenaf germplasm collections (J = 0.38-0.79), suggesting kenaf might have been introduced in India from Africa through Central Asia during early domestication. Genetic similarity-based cluster analysis was in close accordance with taxonomic classification of Hibiscus.

Studies that have quantified levels of ovary activation and reproduction among workers have largely supported this prediction. We sampled pre-emergent male pupae and adult workers from seven colonies at regular intervals throughout the reproductive part of the season. We show that the overall contribution of workers to male (drone) production is 4.2%, nearly 40 times higher than is generally reported, and is highest during reproductive swarming, when an average of 6.2% of the males genotyped are worker-produced. Similarly, workers in our samples were 100 times more likely to have active ovaries than previously assumed. Worker reproduction is seasonally influenced and peaks when colonies are rearing new queens. Not all worker subfamilies contribute equally to reproduction. Instead, certain subfamilies are massively over-represented in drone brood. By laying eggs within the period in which many colonies produce virgin queens, these rare worker subfamilies increase their direct fitness via their well-timed sons.

(2012). Deltocyathiidae, an early-diverging family of Robust corals (Anthozoa, Scleractinia). Zoologica Scripta, 00, 000000. Over the last Decemberade, molecular phylogenetics has called into question some fundamental aspects of coral systematics. Within the Scleractinia, most families composed exclusively by zooxanthellate species are polyphyletic on the basis of molecular data, and the second most speciose coral family, the Caryophylliidae (most members of which are azooxanthellate), is an unnatural grouping. As part of the process of resolving taxonomic affinities of caryophylliids', here a new Robust' scleractinian family (Deltocyathiidae fam. n.) is proposed on the basis of combined molecular (CO1 and 28S rDNA) and morphological data, accommodating the early-diverging clade of traditional caryophylliids (represented today by the genus Deltocyathus). Whereas this family captures the full morphological diversity of the genus Deltocyathus, one species, Deltocyathus magnificus, is an outlier in terms of molecular data, and groups with the Complex coral family Turbinoliidae. Ultrastructural data, however, place D.magnificus within Deltocyathiidae fam. November. Unfortunately, limited ultrastructural data are as yet available for turbinoliids, but D.magnificus may represent the first documented case of morphological convergence at the microstructural level among scleractinian corals.

We aimed to provide the best estimate of the age of Cichorieae and its subtribes based on available fossil evidence and DNA sequences and to interpret their biogeography in the light of Earth history. With more than 1,550 species, the chicory tribe (Cichorieae, Asteraceae) is distributed predominantly in the northern Hemisphere, with centres of distribution in the Mediterranean region, central Asia, and SW North America. Recently, a new phylogenetic hypothesis of Cichorieae based on ITS sequences has been established, shedding new light on phylogenetic relationships within the tribe, which had not been detected so far. Cichorieae possess echinolophate pollen grains, on the surface of which cavities (lacunae) are Septemberarated by ridges. These lacunae and ridges show patterns characteristic of certain groups within Cichorieae. Among the fossil record of echinolophate pollen, the Cichorium intybus-type is the most frequent and also the oldest type (22 to 28.4 million years old). By using an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock approach, the Cichorieae phylogenetic tree was calibrated with this fossil find. According to the analysis, the tribe originated no later than Oligocene. The species-rich core group originated no later than Late Oligocene or Early Miocene and its subtribes diversified no later than Middle/Late Miocene or Early Pliocene-an eventful period of changing geological setting and climate in the Mediterranean region and Eurasia. The first dispersal from Eurasia to North America, which resulted in the radiation of genera and species in North America (subtribe Microseridinae), also occurred no later than Middle or Late Miocene, suggesting the Bering land bridge as the route of dispersal.

The release of large datasets composed of millions of SNPs across hundreds of genomes by HAPMAP, the Human Genome Diversity Panel, and other projects has led to considerable effort to detect selection signals across the nuclear genome (Coop et al., 2009 Lopez Herraez et al., 2009 Sabeti et al., 2006, 2007 Voight et al., 2006). Most of the research has focused on positive selection forces although other selective forces, such as negative selection, may have played a substantive role on the shape of our genome. Here we studied the selective strengths acting presently on the genome by making computational predictions of the pathogenicity of nonsynonymous protein mutations and interpreting the distribution of scores in terms of selection. We could show that the genetic diversity for all the major pathways is still constrained by negative selection in all 11 human populations studied. In a single exception, we observed a relaxation of negative selection acting on olfactory receptors. Since a Decemberreased number of functioning olfactory receptors in human compared with other primates had already been shown, this suggests that the role of olfactory receptors for survival and reproductive success has Decemberreased during human evolution. By showing that negative selection is still relaxed, the present results imply that no plateau of minimal function has yet been reached in modern humans and therefore that olfactory capability might still be Decemberreasing. This is a first clue to present human evolution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Dominance and aggression are ubiquitous traits that are selectively advantageous in many animal societies and have the potential to impact the evolutionary trajectory of animal populations. Here we provide age- and sex-specific estimates of additive genetic and environmental components of variance for dominance rank and aggression rate in a free-living, human-habituated bird population subject to natural selection. We use a long-term data set on individually Marchked greylag geese (Anser anser) and show that phenotypic variation in dominance-related behaviours contains significant additive genetic variance, parental effects and permanent environment effects. The relative importance of these variance components varied between age and sex classes, whereby the most pronounced differences concerned nongenetic components. In particular, parental effects were larger in juveniles of both sexes than in adults. In paired adults, the partner's identity had a larger influence on male dominance rank and aggression rate than in females. In sex- and age-specific estimates, heritabilities did not differ significantly between age and sex classes. Adult dominance rank was only weakly genetically correlated between the sexes, leading to considerably higher heritabilities in sex-specific estimates than across sexes. We discuss these patterns in relation to selection acting on dominance rank and aggression in different life history stages and sexes and suggest that different adaptive optima could be a mechanism for maintaining genetic variation in dominance-related traits in free-living animal populations.

Their phenotypes were almost entirely attributable to selection, rather than to history or ancestry. The fitness of evolved lines in the light was uniformly depressed, presumably through the accumulation of conditionally deleterious genes governing photosynthesis. Some evolved lines were no longer able to grow in the light and are thereby permanently isolated from their ancestors. Specialized autotrophs and heterotrophs may often evolve in algae through long-term shifts in the conditions of growth.

Cooling with strong dessication in the Pleistocene, along with rapid uplift of mountain ranges peripheral to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, appear to have had major impacts on the genetic structure of the flora. To understand the evolutionary history of Lagochilus and the divergence related to these past shifts of habitats among these regions, we sequenced the plastid intergenic spacers, psbA-trnH and trnS-trnG from populations throughout the known distributions of ten species of the genus. We investigated species-level phylogeographical patterns within Lagochilus. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using Neighbor-joining and Bayesian inference. The divergence times of major lineages were estimated with BEAST and IMa. Genetic structure and demographic history were inferred by AMOVA, neutrality tests, mismatch distribution, and Bayesian skyline plot analyses. The results showed that most chloroplast haplotypes were species-specific, and that the phylogeny of Lagochilus is geographically structured. The estimated Bayesian chronology and IMa suggested that the main divergence events for species between major eastern and western portions of the Chinese desert occurred at the Plio-/Pleistocene boundary (ca. 2.1-2.8 Ma ago), and likely coinciding with the formation of these deserts in Northwest China. The regional demographic expansions, in the western region at ca. 0.39 Ma, and in the eastern at ca. 0.06 Ma, or across all regions at ca. 0.26 Ma, showed the response to aridification accompanied by cooling of the Pleistocene sharply increased aridity in the Chinese deserts, which reflects a major influence of geologic and climatic events on the evolution of species of Lagochilus. We suggest that diversification is most likely the result of the past fragmentation due to aridification the expansion of the range of species along with the deserts was an adaptation to dry and cold environments during the Quaternary.

These differences can cause divergent selection on body size and/or shape. Here, we measured sex, age, length, and eight different morphological traits of the blackstripe topminnow, Fundulus notatus, from 19 lake and stream populations across four river drainages in central Illinois. Our goal was to determine whether size and shape differed consistently between lake and stream habitats across drainages. We also considered the effects of age and sex as they may affect size and morphology. We found large differences in body size of age 1 topminnows where stream fish were generally larger than lake fish. Body shape mainly varied as a function of sex. Adult male topminnows had larger morphological traits (with the exception of body width) than females, in particular longer dorsal and anal base lengths. Subtle effects of habitat were present. Stream fish had a longer dorsal fin base than lake fish. These phenotypic patterns may be the result of genetic and/or environmental variation. As these lakes are human-made, the observed differences, if genetic, would have had to occur relatively rapidly (within about 100 years).(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London	June 22, 2013Partial generic revision of Barbula (Musci: Pottiaceae): Re-establishment of Hydrogonium and Streblotrichum, and the new genus Gymnobarbula	TAXON	Barbula Gymnobarbula gen.

Large genera, that were defined using a restricted suite of morphological characters, are particularly prone to be polyphyletic. We analysed a representative selection of species traditionally assigned to the genus Barbula, believed to represent the largest genus of the moss family Pottiaceae, but which recently was suggested to be polyphyletic. Special attention was paid to species traditionally assigned to Barbula sect. Hydrogonium and sect. Convolutae, in which phylogenetic relationships are likely to be incongruent with morphological traits, which could have evolved in adaptation to hydric and otherwise extreme habitats. Our phylogenetic analysis was based on nrITS and chloroplast rps4 and trnM-trnV sequence data and resolved only the type of the genus, B. unguiculata, plus B. orizabensis, in subfamily Pottioideae, while most of the species occurring in the Northern Hemisphere are part of Trichostomoideae and need to be recognized within the re-established and partly re-defined genera Hydrogonium and Streblotrichum. The phylogenetically and morphologically divergent B. bicolor needs to be removed from Streblotrichum to a newly described genus, Gymnobarbula. Numerous taxonomic changes and nomenclatural Novemberelties, resulting from the molecular, morphological and nomenclatural studies are proposed for taxa of Hydrogonium, particularly within the H. consanguineum clade. Lectotypes are selected for Tortula angustifolia Hook. & Grev. ( Hydrogonium angustifolium (Hook. & Grey.) January Kucera, comb. November.), Tortula consanguinea Thwaites & Mitt.

Carrion feeding flies are ubiquitous and can be expected to feed on many vertebrate carcasses. Hence, we tested whether fly-derived DNA analysis may also serve as a Novemberel tool for mammalian diversity surveys. We screened DNA extracted from 201 carrion flies collected in tropical habitats of Cote d'Ivoire and Madagascar for mammal DNA using multiple PCR systems and retrieved DNA sequences from a diverse set of species (22 in Cote d'Ivoire, four in Madagascar) exploiting distinct forest strata and displaying a broad range of body sizes. Deep sequencing of amplicons generated from pools of flies performed equally well as individual sequencing approaches. We conclude that the analysis of fly-derived DNA can be implemented in a very rapid and cost-effective manner and will give a relatively unbiased picture of local mammal diversity. Carrion flies therefore represent an extraordinary and thus far unexploited resource of mammal DNA, which will probably prove useful for future inventories of wild mammal communities.

By using fossils from the well-dated Shungura Formation (lower Omo Valley, northern Turkana Basin, southern Ethiopia), we investigate palaeodietary changes in one bovid and in one suid lineage from 3 to 2 Ma using stable isotope analysis of tooth enamel. Results show unexpectedly large increases in C-4 dietary intake around 2.8 Ma in both the bovid and suid, and possibly in a previously reported hippopotamid species. Enamel delta C-13 values after 2.8 Ma in the bovid (Tragelaphus nakuae) are higher than recorded for any living tragelaphin, and are not expected given its conservative dental morphology. A shift towards increased C-4 feeding at 2.8 Ma in the suid (Kolpochoerus limnetes) appears similarly Decemberoupled from a well-documented record of dental evolution indicating gradual and progressive dietary change. The fact that two, perhaps three, disparate Pliocene herbivore lineages exhibit similar, and contemporaneous changes in dietary behaviour suggests a common environmental driver. Local and regional pollen, palaeosol and faunal records indicate increased aridity but no corresponding large and rapid expansion of grasslands in the Turkana Basin at 2.8 Ma. Our results provide new evidence supporting ecological change in the eastern African record around 2.8 Ma, but raise questions about the resolution at which different ecological proxies may be comparable, the correlation of vegetation and faunal change, and the interpretation of low delta C-13 values in the African Pliocene.

In this study, we examined and compared leaf epidermal features of 112 specimens, representing 105 species and one variety of Lithocarpus from China and adjacent areas and Notholithocarpus densiflorus. As a result of the different interpretations of terms in previous studies, trichome terminology in Lithocarpus and its relatives was re-assessed aiming to reveal the trichome evolutionary patterns in Fagaceae. Twelve types of trichomes and five types of trichome bases were detected in Lithocarpus, among which the broad-based trichome (BBT) is newly reported. Stomata in Lithocarpus are restricted to the cyclocytic type and their size range is 28.6 +/- A 8.2 mu m x 26.5 +/- A 9.3 mu m. The distribution of epidermal features in Lithocarpus revealed three distinct morphological groups: glabrous, BBT, and appressed parallel tufts (APT). The importance of epidermal features across Fagaceae for taxon delimitation is evaluated. Species of Lithocarpus can be accurately identified by the presence of APT or flat epidermal cells combined with non-dark stained subsidiary cells and non-cutinized trichome bases only, or in addition, fasciculate trichome bases. The phylogenetic distribution of epidermal features and their evolutionary trends in Fagaceae is also discussed.

The larval deposition strategy of Allobates femoralis was tested in Southeastern Peru using a blocked, fully crossed experimental design. Arrays of four pools were used to test the effects of pool size and the presence of a predatory insect (Belostomatid) on the deposition behavior of A. femoralis. Further experiments investigated the colonization of insect predators into potential larval habitats and interactions between predatory insects. Results suggest that pool size, the presence of predatory aquatic insects, and interactions between predators, influence larval deposition in A. femoralis. Similar ecological interactions may have driven toxic dendrobatids to the use of arboreal phytotelmata and associated derived reproductive strategies.

This variation in pelage brightness is associated with aspects of evolutionary ecology, particularly for primates, but little is known about the genetic mechanisms underlying light-dark differences in pelage pigmentation. Previous work, focusing particularly on macaques (Genus Macaca), has found no clear relationship between color variation and coding sequences of key pigmentation genes. This suggests that other loci and/or gene regulatory differences underlie this variation and raises the question of how patterns of gene expression differ in light verses dark hair follicles. Here, we examine relative expression levels of pigmentation genes in hair follicles from free-ranging rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) showing stark light-dark coat color variation. We quantified the brightness (reflectance) of plucked hair tufts using a spectrophotometer. We extracted RNA from the follicles and used quantitative RT-PCR to measure the relative amounts of gene product (mRNA) for seven candidate pigmentation genes (MITF, MC1R, MGRN1, ATRN, SLC24A5, TYRP1, and DCT). Expression values were normalized with the house-keeping gene ACTB. All candidate genes were expressed at similar levels in dark, intermediate, and light hair, and thus, light-dark variation in macaque coat color is unlikely to be due to differences in the expression of these key pigmentation genes. This study represents the first examination of gene expression and natural color variation in a non-human primate population. Our results indicate that even in a system, like pigmentation, where a candidate-gene approach is promising, identifying important intra-specific gene regulatory differences remains challenging.

Here, we conduct a genome-wide association study of Drosophila melanogaster courtship song variation using 168 sequenced inbred lines, and fail to find highly significant associations. However, by combining these data with results from a well-powered Evolve and Resequence (E&R) study on the same trait, we provide statistical evidence that some power to associate genotype and phenotype is available. Genes that are significant in both analyses are enriched for expression in the nervous system, and affect neural development and synaptic growth when perturbed. Quantitative complementation at one of these loci, Syntrophin-like 1, supports a hypothesis that variation at this locus affects variation in the inter-pulse interval of courtship song. These results suggest that experimental evolution may provide an approach for genome-scale replication in Drosophila.

We characterize a diverse clade of frogs (Kaloula, Microhylidae) in the Philippine island archipelago as an example of an adaptive radiation into three priMarchy habitat specialists or ecotypes. We use a Novemberel phylogenetic estimate for this clade to evaluate the tempo of lineage accumulation and morphological diversification. Because species-level phylogenetic estimates for Philippine Kaloula are lacking, we employ dense population sampling to determine the appropriate evolutionary lineages for diversification analyses. We explicitly take phylogenetic uncertainty into account when calculating diversification and disparification statistics and fitting models of diversification. Following dispersal to the Philippines from Southeast Asia, Kaloula radiated rapidly into several well-supported clades. Morphological variation within Kaloula is partly explained by ecotype and accumulated at high levels during this radiation, including within ecotypes. We pinpoint an axis of morphospace related directly to climbing and digging behaviors and find patterns of phenotypic evolution suggestive of ecological opportunity with partitioning into distinct habitat specialists. We conclude by discussing the components of phenotypic diversity that are likely important in amphibian adaptive radiations.

However, few studies in squamate reptiles have quantified interindividual colour variation that includes the structural ultraviolet (UV) component (300-400nm). In the present study, we investigated variability of a ventral UV/yellow-red ornamentation in the common lizard Zootoca vivipara, including an analysis of spatial distribution, as well as sex and age differences. We also investigated whether the expression of coloration is related to body size and condition. Our analyses revealed two distinct patches: a gular patch with a strong UV reflectance and a belly patch with a dominant yellow-red reflectance. Males displayed a less saturated throat coloration with higher UV chroma and UV hue, and had a redder but duller belly coloration than females. Yearlings had less elaborate ornaments than adults, although they already displayed a yellow-red sexual dichromatism on the belly. UV sexual dichromatism was only apparent in adults as a result of a weaker UV reflectance in females, suggesting potential fitness costs of a bright UV coloration in that sex. Different colour traits were related to body size in both sexes, as well as to body condition in males. We discuss the potential evolutionary scenarios leading to the maintenance of this ornament in common lizards.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 128-141.

We integrated morphological, vocal, genetic and behavioural data to test predictions pertaining to the hypothesis of parapatric ecological speciation associated with elevation in populations of a tropical montane songbird, the Grey-breasted Wood-wren (Henicorhina leucophrys: Troglodytidae), from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marchta, Colombia. We confirmed that two distinct populations exist along the elevational gradient. Phylogenetic analyses tentatively indicate that the two populations are not sister taxa, suggesting they did not differentiate from a single ancestor along the gradient, but rather resulted from Septemberarate colonization events. The populations showed Marchked divergence in morphometrics, vocalizations and genetic variation in mitochondrial and nuclear loci, and little to no evidence of hybridization. Individuals of both populations responded more strongly to their own local songs than to songs from another elevation. Although the two forms do not appear to have differentiated locally in parapatry, morphological and vocal divergence along the elevational gradient is consistent with adaptation, suggesting a possible link between adaptive evolution in morphology and songs and the origin of reproductive isolation via a behavioural barrier to gene flow. The adaptive value of phenotypic differences between populations requires additional study.

However, organisms with high dispersal potential across a spatially or temporally heterogeneous landscape pose an interesting challenge to this view requiring local selection every generation or when environmental conditions change to generate adaptation in adults. Here, we test for geographical and sequence-based signals of selection in five putatively adaptive and two putatively neutral genes identified in a previous genome scan of the highly dispersing purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Comparing six populations spanning the species' wide latitudinal range from Canada to Baja California, Mexico, we find positive tests for selection in the putative adaptive genes and not in the putative neutral genes. Specifically, we find an excess of low-frequency and nonsynonymous polymorphisms in two transcription factors and a transporter protein, and an excess of common amino acid polymorphisms in the two transcription factors, suggestive of spatially balancing selection. We test for a genetic correlation with temperature, a dominant environmental variable in this coastal ecosystem. We find mild clines and a stronger association of genetic variation with temperature than latitude in four of the five putative adaptive loci and a signal of local adaptation in the Southern California Bight. Overall, patterns of genetic variation match predictions based on spatially or temporally balancing selection in a heterogeneous landscape and illustrate the value of geographical and coalescent tests on candidate loci identified in a genome-wide scan for selection.

One putative pattern, known as Rensch's rule, posits that, among species with female-larger SSD, the relative degree of SSD Decemberlines with species' body size, whereas, among male-larger SSD species, relative SSD increases with size. Using a dataset of 196 chelonian species from all fourteen families, we investigated the correlation in body size evolution between male and female Chelonia and the validity of Rensch's rule for the taxon and within its major clades. We conclude that malefemale correlations in body size evolution are high, although these correlations differ among chelonian families. Overall, SSD scales isometrically with body size Rensch's rule is valid for only one family, Testudinidae (tortoises). Because macroevolutionary patterns of SSD can vary Marchkedly among clades, even in a taxon as morphologically conservative as Testudines, one must guard against inappropriately pooling clades in comparative studies of SSD. The results of the present study also indicate that regression models that assume the x-variable (e.g. male body size) is measured without statistical error, although frequently reported, will result in erroneous conclusions about phylogenetic trends in sexual size dimorphism.

Some mammals have highly organized vibrissae and are able to whisk them. Movement of vibrissae is influenced by intrinsic vibrissa musculature, striated muscle bands that attach directly to the vibrissa capsule. It is unclear if primates have organized vibrissae or intrinsic vibrissa musculature and it is uncertain if they can move their vibrissae. The present study used histomorphological techniques to compare vibrissae among 19 primates and seven non-primate mammalian taxa. Upper lips of these mammals were sectioned and processed for histochemical analysis. While controlling for phylogenetic effects the following hypotheses were tested: 1) mammals with well-organized vibrissae possess intrinsic vibrissa musculature and 2) intrinsic vibrissa musculature is best developed in nOctoberurnal, arboreal taxa. Our qualitative analyses show that only arboreal, nOctoberurnal prosimians possess intrinsic musculature. Not all taxa that possessed organized vibrissae had intrinsic vibrissa musculature. Phylogenetic comparative analyses revealed a 70% probability that stem mammals, primates, and haplorhines possessed intrinsic vibrissa musculature and well-organized vibrissae. These two traits most likely coevolved according to a discrete phylogenetic analysis. These results indicate that nOctoberurnal, arboreal primates have the potential to more actively use their vibrissae in spatial recognition and navigation tasks than diurnal, more terrestrial species, but there is a clear phylogenetic signal involved in the evolution of primate vibrissae and face touch.

Because they also may affect mate choice, they are candidates for having great importance in ecological speciation. Here, we use next-generation sequencing to test the general hypothesis of parallelism in patterns of MHCII diversity and bacterial infections among five dwarf and normal whitefish sympatric pairs. A second objective was to assess the functional relationships between specific MHCII alleles and pathogens in natural conditions. Each individual had between one and four alleles, indicating two paralogous loci. In Cliff Lake, the dwarf ecotype was monomorphic for the most common allele. In Webster Lake, the skew in the allelic distribution was towards the same allele but in the normal ecotype, underscoring the nonparallel divergence among lakes. Our signal of balancing selection matched putative peptide binding region residues in some cases, but not in others, supporting other recent findings of substantial functional differences in fish MHCII compared with mammals. Individuals with fewer alleles were less likely to be infected thus, we found no evidence for the heterozygote advantage hypothesis. MHCII alleles and pathogenic bacteria formed distinct clusters in multivariate analyses, and clusters of certain alleles were associated with clusters of pathogens, or sometimes the absence of pathogens, indicating functional relationships at the individual level. Given that patterns of MHCII and bacteria were nonparallel among dwarf and normal whitefish pairs, we conclude that pathogens driving MHCII evolution did not play a direct role in their parallel phenotypic evolution.

Sponges, the sister group of all other animals and probably the earliest branching multicellular lineage of extant animals, are thought to possess totipotent stem cells. This review introduces what is known about the stem cells in sponges based on histological studies and also on recent molecular biological studies that have started to reveal the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the stem cell system in sponges (mainly in demosponges). The currently proposed model of the stem cell system in demosponges is described, and the possible applicability of this model to other classes of sponges is discussed. Finally, a possible scenario of the evolution of stem cells, including how migrating stem cells arose in the urmetazoan (the last common ancestor of metazoans) and the evolutionary origin of germ line cells in the urbilaterian (the last common ancestor of bilaterians), are discussed.

In most species, however, males that engage in same-sex sexual behaviour also mate with females, and in theory, same-sex mating could even increase male reproductive fitness if males improve their chances of future heterosexual mating. Females regularly use social information to choose a mate e. g. male attractiveness increases after a male has interacted sexually with a female (mate choice copying). Here, we demonstrate that males of the tropical freshwater fish Poecilia mexicana increase their attractiveness to females not only by opposite-sex, but likewise, through same-sex interactions. Hence, direct benefits for males of exhibiting homosexual behaviour may help explain its occurrence and persistence in species in which females rely on mate choice copying as one component of mate quality assessment.

Here the micro-injection of extracts of male reproductive tissues is used to determine the effect of male and female strain on female fecundity and longevity. Four strains of C. chinensis, known to differ in their propensity to remate were assayed. The results indicate that male and female strain both influence female fecundity and longevity. However, consistent patterns of response were not observed as revealed by a significant interaction between male and female strains. The evolutionary implications of these results are discussed.

Sexual dimorphism is instead restricted to occur through sex-specific expression and splicing of gene products. Evolution of sexual dimorphism through these mechanisms should, however, also be constrained when the sexes share the genetic architecture for regulation of gene expression. Despite these obstacles, sexual dimorphism is prevalent in the animal kingdom and commonly evolves rapidly. Here, we ask whether the genetic architecture of gene expression is plastic and easily molded by sex-specific selection, or if sexual dimorphism evolves rapidly despite pervasive genetic constraint. To address this question, we explore the relationship between the intersexual genetic correlation for gene expression (r(MF)), which captures how independently genes are regulated in the sexes, and the evolution of sex-biased gene expression. Using transcriptome data from Drosophila melanogaster, we find that most genes have a high r(MF) and that genes currently exposed to sexually antagonistic selection have a higher average r(MF) than other genes. We further show that genes with a high r(MF) have less pronounced sex-biased gene expression than genes with a low r(MF) within D. melanogaster and that the strength of the r(MF) in D. melanogaster predicts the degree to which the sex bias of a gene's expression has changed between D. melanogaster and six other species in the Drosophila genus. In sum, our results show that a shared genome constrains both short- and long-term evolution of sexual dimorphism.

Genomic and transcriptomic developments have made it possible to assess sex-specific selection at the molecular level, and it is clear that sex-specific selection shapes the evolutionary properties of several genomic characteristics, including transcription, post-transcriptional regulation, imprinting, genome structure and gene sequence. Sex-specific selection is strongly influenced by mating system, which also causes neutral evolutionary changes that affect different regions of the genome in different ways. Here, we synthesize theoretical and molecular work in order to provide a cohesive view of the role of sex-specific selection and mating system in genome evolution. We also highlight the need for a combined approach, incorporating both genomic data and experimental phenotypic studies, in order to understand precisely how sex-specific selection drives evolutionary change across the genome.

The evolution of reptile herbivory and its relationship to mammalian diversification is poorly understood with respect to climate and the roles of predation pressure and competition for food resources. Here, we describe a giant fossil acrodontan lizard recovered with a diverse mammal assemblage from the late middle Eocene Pondaung Formation of MyanMarch, which provides a historical test of factors controlling body size in herbivorous squamates. We infer a predominately herbivorous feeding ecology for the new acrodontan based on dental anatomy, phylogenetic relationships and body size. Ranking body masses for Pondaung Formation vertebrates indicates that the lizard occupied a size niche among the larger herbivores and was larger than most carnivorous mammals. Paleotemperature estimates of Pondaung Formation environments based on the body size of the new lizard are approximately 2-5 degrees C higher than modern. These results indicate that competitive exclusion and predation by mammals did not restrict body size evolution in these herbivorous squamates, and elevated temperatures relative to modern climates during the Paleogene greenhouse may have resulted in the evolution of gigantism through elevated poikilothermic metabolic rates and in response to increases in floral productivity.

However, little is known about the action of single genes on adult mandible shape so far, since most developmentally relevant genes are already required during embryogenesis, i.e., knockouts lead to embryonic death or severe deformations, before the mandible is fully formed. We employ here a geometric morphometric approach to identify subtle phenotypic differences caused by dosage effects of candidate genes. We use mouse strains with specific gene modifications (knockouts and knockins) to compare heterozygous animals with controls from the same stock, which is expected to be equivalent to a change of gene expression of the respective locus. Such differences in expression level are also likely to occur as part of the natural variation. We focus on Bmp pathway genes (Bmp4, its antagonist Noggin, and combinations of Bmp5-7 genotypes), but include also two other developmental control genes suspected to affect mandible development in some way (Egfr and Irf6). In addition, we study the effects of Hoxd13, as well as an extracellular matrix constituent (Col2a1). We find that subtle but significant shape differences are caused by differences in gene dosage of several of these genes. The changes seen for Bmp4 and Noggin are partially compatible with the action of these genes known from birds and fish. We find significant shape changes also for Hoxd13, although this gene has so far only been implicated in skeletal patterning processes of the limbs. Comparing the effect sizes of gene dosage changes to the variation found in natural populations of mice as well as quantitative trait loci (QTL) effects on mandible shape, we find that the effect sizes caused by gene dosage changes are at the lower end of the spectrum of natural variation, but larger than the average additive effects found in QTL studies. We conclude that studying gene dosage effects have the potential to provide new insights into aspects of craniofacial development, variation, and evolution.

A number of causal factors have been proposed for the evolution of terrestrialized breeding. While predation has received repeated attention as a potential factor, the influence of other factors such as habitat has never been tested using appropriate data or methods. Using a dataset that comprises 180 amphibian species from various East African habitats, we tested whether species occurring in different habitats show different patterns of terrestrialization in their breeding strategy. We recovered a significant association between terrestrialized breeding strategies and forest habitats. In general, forest seems to act as a facilitator, providing a permissive environment for the evolution of terrestrialized breeding strategies. However, while terrestrial oviposition is strongly correlated with lowland and montane forest habitat, complete terrestrial development is significantly correlated with montane forest only, indicating different selective pressures acting at different steps towards complete terrestrial development.

Signals are particularly important for inter-sexual selection, where females use male signalling traits to select mates. Female preferences are therefore a major selective force in the evolution of these male signals, and these preferences can facilitate rapid changes in these traits in an evolutionary timeframe. This introduction of high levels of variation in inter-sexual signals may overshadow any phylogenetic patterns present. Such shadowing effects, however, should be dependant on the characteristics of traits (e.g. morphological, physiological and behavioural). Using male advertisement calls from 72 species of anuran amphibians, we tested the levels of phylogenetic signal present for a variety of call features in relation to trait types, and for calls as whole units using phylogenetic principal components analysis. We found that most call features displayed some level of phylogenetic autocorrelation (or signal), with traits that are dependent on morphology having much stronger phylogenetic signals than those based on behaviour. In addition, when calls were analysed as whole units, closely related species were found to be similar to each other, indicating that phylogenetic patterns had not been cancelled out by selection via female preferences. We suggest that signal functions, such as indicating male quality (e.g. mediated by body size) to potential mates, may place constraints on the amount of variation that can be introduced by female preferences. More research, particularly studies on other taxa, will be required to elucidate whether the patterns found in anurans are general across the animal kingdom.

To date, little evidence exists that several different components of colour elaboration are condition dependent and no direct evidence exists that different ornamental components are affected by different sources of variation. For example, in carotenoid-based plumage colouration, one of the best-known condition-dependent ornaments, colour elaboration stems from both condition-dependent pigment concentration and structural components. Some environmental flexibility of these components has been suggested, but specifically which and how they are affected remains unknown. Here, we tested whether multiple colour components may be condition dependent, by using a comprehensive 3x2 experimental design, in which we carotenoid supplemented and immune challenged great tit nestlings (Parus major) and quantified effects on different components of colouration. Plumage colouration was affected by an interaction between carotenoid availability and immune challenge. Path analyses showed that carotenoid supplementation increased plumage saturation via feather carotenoid concentration and via mechanisms unrelated to carotenoid deposition, while immune challenge affected feather length, but not carotenoid concentration. Thus, independent condition-dependent pathways, affected by different sources of variation, determine colour elaboration. This provides opportunities for the evolution of multiple signals within components of ornamental traits. This finding indicates that the selective forces shaping the evolution of different components of a composite trait and the trait's signal content may be more complex than believed so far, and that holistic approaches are required for drawing comprehensive evolutionary conclusions.

These weak activities do not affect the fitness of the organism under ordinary circumstances, but can serve as potential evolutionary precursors of new catalytic functions. We wondered whether different proteins with the same substrate ambiguous activity evolve differently under identical selection conditions. Patrick et al. (Patrick WM, Quandt EM, Swartzlander DB, Matsumura I. 2007. Multicopy suppression underpins metabolic evolvability. Mol Biol Evol. 24: 2716-2722.) previously showed that three multicopy suppressors, gph, hisB, and ytjC, rescue Delta serB Escherichia coli cells from starvation on minimal media. We directed the evolution of variants of Gph, histidinol phosphatase (HisB), and YtjC that complemented Delta serB more efficiently, and characterized the effects of the amino acid changes, alone and in combination, upon the evolved phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP) activity. Gph and HisB are members of the HAD superfamily of hydrolases, but they adapted through different, kinetically distinguishable, biochemical mechanisms. All of the selected mutations, except N102T in YtjC, proved to be beneficial in isolation. They exhibited a pattern of antagonistic epistasis, as their effects in combination upon the kinetic parameters of the three proteins in reactions with phosphoserine were nonmultiplicative. The N102T mutation exhibited sign epistasis, as it was deleterious in isolation but beneficial in the context of other mutations. We also showed that the D57N mutation in the chromosomal copy of hisB is sufficient to suppress the Delta serB deletion. These results in combination show that proteomes can offer multiple mechanistic solutions to a molecular recognition problem.

In this study, we compared DNA sequence variability of the three genomes (nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplastic) of a gynodioecious species, Silene nutans, with that of a closely related dioecious species, Silene otites. In the light of theoretical models, we expect cytoplasmic diversity to differ between the two species due to the selective dynamics that acts on cytoplasmic genomes in gynodioecious species: under an epidemic scenario, the gynodioecious species is expected to exhibit lower cytoplasmic diversity than the dioecious species, while the opposite is expected in the case of balancing selection maintaining sterility cytoplasms in the gynodioecious species. We found no difference between the species for nuclear gene diversity, but, for the cytoplasmic loci, the gynodioecious S. nutans had more haplotypes, and higher nucleotide diversity, than the dioecious relative, S. otites, even though the latter has a relatively high rate of mitochondrial synonymous substitutions, and therefore presumably a higher mutation rate. Therefore, as the mitochondrial mutation rate cannot account for the higher cytoplasmic diversity found in S. nutans, our findings support the hypothesis that gynodioecy in S. nutans has been maintained by balancing selection rather than by epidemic-like dynamics.

Hexaploid wild oat (Avena fatua) is a global crop weed and many populations have evolved herbicide resistance. We studied plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase)-inhibiting herbicide resistance in hexaploid wild oat and revealed that resistant individuals can express one, two or three different plastidic ACCase gene resistance mutations (IIe-1781-Leu, Asp-2078-Gly and Cys-2088-Arg). Using ACCase resistance mutations as molecular Marchkers, combined with genetic, molecular and biochemical approaches, we found in individual resistant wild-oat plants that (1) up to three unlinked ACCase gene loci assort independently following Mendelian laws for disomic inheritance, (2) all three of these homoeologous ACCase genes were transcribed, with each able to carry its own mutation and (3) in a hexaploid background, each individual ACCase resistance mutation confers relatively low-level herbicide resistance, in contrast to high-level resistance conferred by the same mutations in unrelated diploid weed species of the Poaceae (grass) family. Low resistance conferred by individual ACCase resistance mutations is likely due to a dilution effect by susceptible ACCase expressed by homoeologs in hexaploid wild oat and/or differential expression of homoeologous ACCase gene copies. Thus, polyploidy in hexaploid wild oat may slow resistance evolution. Evidence of coexisting non-target-site resistance mechanisms among wild-oat populations was also revealed. In all, these results demonstrate that herbicide resistance and its evolution can be more complex in hexaploid wild oat than in unrelated diploid grass weeds. Our data provide a starting point for the daunting task of understanding resistance evolution in polyploids.

Molecular phylogenetics, biogeography and evolutionary tempo of the 'Gondwanan' midge Stictocladius Edwards (Diptera: Chironomidae)	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	New Zealand Drowning Gondwana Vicariance Dispersal BEAST	NEW-ZEALAND GOODBYE GONDWANA MIXED MODELS DISPERSAL ORIGIN RECONSTRUCTIONS VICARIANCE INFERENCE ANCIENT SUPPORT	Many insect clades, especially within the Diptera (true flies), have been considered classically 'Gondwanan', with an inference that distributions derive from vicariance of the southern continents. Assessing the role that vicariance has played in the evolution of austral taxa requires testing the location and tempo of diversification and speciation against the well-established predictions of fragmentation of the ancient super-continent. Several early (anecdotal) hypotheses that current austral distributions originate from the breakup of Gondwana derive from studies of taxa within the family Chironomidae (non-biting midges). With the advent of molecular phylogenetics and biogeographic analytical software, these studies have been revisited and expanded to test such conclusions better. Here we studied the midge genus Stictocladius Edwards, from the subfamily Orthocladiinae, which contains austral-distributed clades that match vicariance-based expectations. We resolve several issues of systematic relationships among morphological species and reveal cryptic diversity within many taxa. Time-calibrated phylogenetic relationships among taxa accorded partially with the predicted tempo from geology. For these apparently vagile insects, vicariance-dated patterns persist for South America and Australia. However, as often found, divergence time estimates for New Zealand at c. 50 mya post-date Septemberaration of Zealandia from Antarctica and the remainder of Gondwana, but predate the proposed Oligocene 'drowning' of these islands. We detail other such 'anomalous' dates and suggest a single common explanation rather than stochastic processes. This could involve synchronous establishment following recovery from 'drowning' and/or deleteriously warming associated with the mid-Eocene climatic optimum (hence 'waving', which refers to cycles of drowning events) plus new availability of topography providing of cool running waters, or all these factors in combination. Alternatively a vicariance explanation remains available, given the uncertain duration of connectivity of Zealandia to Australia-Antarctic-South America via the Lord Howe and Norfolk ridges into the Eocene.

If the prey vary in toxicity, the predators may alternatively learn to capture and taste-sample prey carefully before ingesting or rejecting them (go-slow behaviour). An increase in prey toxicity is generally thought to Decemberrease predation on prey populations. However, while prey with a higher toxin load are more harmful to ingest, they may also be easier to recognize and reject owing to greater distastefulness, which can facilitate a taste-sampling foraging strategy. Here, the classic diet model is used to study the Septemberarate effects of taste and toxicity on predator preferences. The taste-sampling process is modelled using signal detection theory. The model is applicable to automimicry and Batesian mimicry. It shows that when the defensive toxin is sufficiently distasteful, a mimicry complex may be less profitable to the predator and better protected against predation if the models are moderately toxic than if they are highly toxic. Moreover, taste mimicry can reduce the profitability of the mimicry complex and increase protection against predation. The results are discussed in relation to the selection pressures acting on prey defences and the evolution of mimicry.

The nonanadromous individuals, frequently males, mature at a much smaller size in freshwater without undergoing Marchine migrations and often successfully fertilize many eggs laid by anadromous females. Because these small males do not recruit to fisheries, they are often not regarded in high esteem by fishers. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Johnstone etal. () demonstrate that by substantially contributing to reproduction, such males help maintain genetic diversity in a Decemberlining population of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Their results show that estimates of effective population size (Ne), obtained by counting the number of anadromous adults returning from sea and correcting for unequal sex ratios, are lower than estimates generated from genetic Marchkers. Many mechanisms are expected to reduce Ne below the adult census population size (N) the opposite pattern of Ne>N observed by Johnstone etal. () is difficult to explain unless the reproductive effort of nonanadromous males is accounted for. The results have important implications for the conservation of small populations and highlight the challenges of relating Ne to N in organisms with complex life histories.

There are two different classes of adaptive explanation for associations between early-life adversity and accelerated reproduction, both based on the idea of predictive adaptive responses (PARs). According to external PAR hypotheses, early-life adversity provides a 'weather forecast' of the environmental conditions into which the individual will mature, and it is adaptive for the individual to develop an appropriate phenotype for this anticipated environment. In internal PAR hypotheses, early-life adversity has a lasting negative impact on the individual's somatic state, such that her health is likely to fail more rapidly as she gets older, and there is an advantage to adjusting her reproductive schedule accordingly. We use a model of fluctuating environments to derive evolveability conditions for acceleration of reproductive timing in response to early-life adversity in a long-lived organism. For acceleration to evolve via the external PAR process, early-life cues must have a high degree of validity and the level of annual autocorrelation in the individual's environment must be almost perfect. For acceleration to evolve via the internal PAR process requires that early-life experience must determine a significant fraction of the variance in survival prospects in adulthood. The two processes are not mutually exclusive, and mechanisms for calibrating reproductive timing on the basis of early experience could evolve through a combination of the predictive value of early-life adversity for the later environment and its negative impact on somatic state.

This review sumMarchises and discusses, for the Metazoa, the general aspects of mitochondrial transcription and replication with respect to control regions as well as several proposed models of gene rearrangements. As whole genome sequencing projects accumulate, more and more observations about mitochondrial gene transfer to the nucleus are reported. Thus occurrence and phylogenetic aspects concerning nuclear mitochondrial-like sequences (NUMTS) is another aspect of this review. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

(2011) suggesting that specimen SEMC-F97 is the result of the skimming behavior of a neopteran insect and, more importantly, fossil evidence of ... surface skimming as a precursor to the evolution of flight in insects (Marchden 2013) is found to be deficient on three fronts: (1) the principal specimen was never viewed firsthand which led to significant morphological misinterpretations (2) poorly designed and executed neoichnological experiments led to incredulous results and (3) the assumption that this specimen is fossil evidence supporting the surface skimming hypothesis of the origin of insect flight despite the fact that since its induction into the literature that hypothesis has been refuted based on significant paleontological, phylogenetic, genetic, and developmental evidence.

We evaluated diversity at two MHC class II B genes, DQB and DRB, in the New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri, NZSL) a species that has suffered high mortality owing to bacterial epizootics, using Sanger sequencing and haplotype reconstruction, together with next-generation sequencing. Despite this species' prolonged history of small population size and highly restricted distribution, we demonstrate extensive diversity at MHC DRB with 26 alleles, whereas MHC DQB is dimorphic. We identify four DRB codons, predicted to be involved in antigen binding, that are evolving under adaptive evolution. Our data suggest diversity at DRB may be maintained by balancing selection, consistent with the role of this locus as an antigen-binding region and the species' recent history of mass mortality during a series of bacterial epizootics. Phylogenetic analyses of DQB and DRB sequences from pinnipeds and other carnivores revealed significant allelic diversity, but little phylogenetic depth or structure among pinniped alleles thus, we could neither confirm nor refute the possibility of trans-species polymorphism in this group. The phylogenetic pattern observed however, suggests some significant evolutionary constraint on these loci in the recent past, with the pattern consistent with that expected following an epizootic event. These data may help further elucidate some of the genetic factors underlying the unusually high susceptibility to bacterial infection of the threatened NZSL, and help us to better understand the extent and pattern of MHC diversity in pinnipeds.

Thus, for protein-coding genes, phylogenetic inference is expected to be more accurate under codon models. So far, phylogeny reconstruction under codon models has been elusive due to computational difficulties of dealing with high dimension matrices. Here, we present a fast maximum likelihood (ML) package for phylogenetic inference, CodonPhyML offering hundreds of different codon models, the largest variety to date, for phylogeny inference by ML. CodonPhyML is tested on simulated and real data and is shown to offer excellent speed and convergence properties. In addition, CodonPhyML includes most recent fast methods for estimating phylogenetic branch supports and provides an integral framework for models selection, including amino acid and DNA models.

However, progress in understanding how maturation phenotypes evolve has been held back by confusion over how best to model maturation Decemberisions and a lack of studies comparing genotypic variation in maturation. Here, we fitted probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs) to data collected from five clones of Daphnia magna and five of Daphnia pulex collected from within and between different populations. We directly compared the utility of modeling approaches that assume maturation to be a process with an instantaneous rate with those that do not by fitting maturation rate and logistic regression models, and emphasize similarities and differences between them. Our results demonstrate that in Daphnia, PMRNs using a logistic regression approach were simpler to use and provided a better fit to the data. The Decemberision to mature was plastic across a range of growth trajectories and dependent upon both body size and age. However, the age effect was stronger in D. magna than D. pulex and varied considerably between clones. Our results support the idea that maturation thresholds can evolve but also suggest that the notion of a threshold based on a single fixed state is an oversimplification that underestimates the adaptability of these important traits.

Humans are generally believed to produce low bite forces and spend less time chewing compared with other apes because advances in mechanical and thermal food processing techniques alter food material properties in such a way as to reduce overall masticatory effort. However, when hominins began regularly consuming mechanically processed or cooked diets is not known. Here, we apply a model for estimating maximum bite forces and stresses at the second molar in modern human, nonhuman primate, and hominin skulls that incorporates skeletal data along with species-specific estimates of jaw muscle architecture. The model, which reliably estimates bite forces, shows a significant relationship between second molar bite force and second molar area across species but does not confirm our hypothesis of isometry. Specimens in the genus Homo fall below the regression line describing the relationship between bite force and molar area for nonhuman anthropoids and australopiths. These results suggest that Homo species generate maximum bite forces below those predicted based on scaling among australopiths and nonhuman primates. Because this Decemberline occurred before evidence for cooking, we hypothesize that selection for lower bite force production was likely made possible by an increased reliance on nonthermal food processing. However, given substantial variability among in vivo bite force magnitudes measured in humans, environmental effects, especially variations in food mechanical properties, may also be a factor. The results also suggest that australopiths had ape-like bite force capabilities. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

PHASE-CHANGE GENOME SIZE	Mediterranean pines represent an extremely heterogeneous assembly. Although they have evolved under similar environmental conditions, they diversified long ago, ca. 10 Mya, and present distinct biogeographic and demographic histories. Therefore, it is of special interest to understand whether and to what extent they have developed specific strategies of adaptive evolution through time and space. To explore evolutionary patterns, the Mediterranean pines' phylogeny was first reconstructed analyzing a new set of 21 low-copy nuclear genes with multilocus Bayesian tree reconstruction methods. Secondly, a phylogenetic approach was used to search for footprints of natural selection and to examine the evolution of multiple phenotypic traits. We identified two genes (involved in pines' defense and stress responses) that have likely played a role in the adaptation of Mediterranean pines to their environment. Moreover, few life-history traits showed historical or evolutionary adaptive convergence in Mediterranean lineages, while patterns of character evolution revealed various evolutionary trade-offs linking growth-development, reproduction and fire-related traits. Assessing the evolutionary path of important life-history traits, as well as the genomic basis of adaptive variation is central to understanding the past evolutionary success of Mediterranean pines and their future response to environmental changes.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether melanin-based coloration could signal the ability of mothers to mount a humoral response and to transfer maternal antibodies (Ab) to their young. We injected differently coloured (pale and dark) female feral pigeons (Columba livia) with Chlamydiae (a natural antigen) and Keyhole Limpet Haemocyanin (KLH, an artificial antigen), and found no significant difference in humoral response between differently coloured females. However, darker females transferred more Ab against Chlamydiae into their eggs than paler ones, despite similar circulating levels of Ab. In addition to this, melanin-based coloration showed a high heritability value. This suggests that a genetically based coloured trait might be linked to the ability of females to transfer specific Ab against Chlamydiae (but not against KLH) to their offspring, independent of their ability to produce Ab. This suggests that transmission of maternal Ab is antigen dependent, and that melanin-based coloration might signal female ability to transmit specific Ab against natural pathogens.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 108, 647-657.

Despite its importance, there is little information on its genetic basis or its phenotypic and genetic correlation with fitness-related traits. Here, we examine the heritability of melanism in the wing dimorphic sand cricket and determine its phenotypic and genetic correlation with wing morphology, gonad mass and size of the dorso-longitudinal muscles (the principle flight muscles). Previously demonstrated trade-offs among these traits are significant factors in the evolution of life history variation. Using path analysis, we show that melanization is causally related to gonad mass, but not flight muscle mass. Averaged over the sexes, the heritability of melanism was 0.61, the genetic correlation with gonad mass was -0.36 and with wing morph was 0.51. The path model correctly predicted the ranking of melanization score in lines selected for increased ovary mass, increased flight muscle mass, an index that increased both traits and an unselected control. Our results support the general hypothesis that melanization is costly for insects and negatively impacts investment in early reproduction.

Recently, genome-wide identification and evolutionary analyses of the ANK gene family have been carried out in Arabidopsis and rice. However, little is known regarding the ANK genes in the entire maize genome. In this study, we described the identification and structural characterization of 71 ANK genes in maize (ZmANK). Then, comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of ZmANK genes family were performed including phylogenetic, domain and motif analysis, chromosomal localization, intron/exon structural patterns, gene duplications and expression profiling. Domain composition analyses showed that ZmANK genes formed ten subfamilies. Five tandem duplications and 14 segmental duplications were identified in ZmANK genes. Furthermore, we took comparative analysis of the total ANK gene family in Arabidopsis, rice and maize, ZmANKs were more closely paired with OsANKs than with AtANKs. At last, expression profile analyses were performed. Forty-one members of ZmANK genes held EST sequences records. Semi-quantitative expression and microarray data analysis of these 41 ZmANK genes demonstrated that ZmANK genes exhibit a various expression pattern, suggesting that functional diversification of ZmANK genes family. The results will present significant insights to explore ANK genes expression and function in future studies in maize.

GENUS METSCHNIKOWIA ASCOMYCETOUS YEASTS MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD EPHEMERAL FLOWERS POPULATION-STRUCTURE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENTS NITIDULID BEETLES GREEN LACEWINGS	Metschnikowia (Saccharomycetales, Metschnikowiaceae/Metschnikowia clade) is an ascomycetous yeast genus whose species are associated mostly with angiosperms and their insect pollinators over all continents. The wide distribution of the genus, its association with angiosperm flowers, and the fact that it includes some of the best-studied yeasts in terms of biogeography and ecology make Metschnikowia an excellent group to investigate a possible co-radiation with angiosperm lineages. We performed phylogenetic analyses implementing Bayesian inference and likelihood methods, using a concatenated matrix (approximate to 2.6 Kbp) of nuclear DNA (ACT1, 1st and 2nd codon positions of EF2, Mcm7, and RPB2) sequences. We included 77 species representing approximately 90% of the species in the family. Bayesian and parsimony methods were used to perform ancestral character reconstructions within Metschnikowia in three key morphological characters. Patterns of evolution of yeast habitats and divergence times were explored in the Metschnikowia clade lineages with the purpose of inferring the time of origin of angiosperm-associated habitats within Metschnikowiaceae. This paper presents the first phylogenetic hypothesis to include nearly all known species in the family. The polyphyletic nature of Clavispora was confirmed and Metschnikowia species (and their anamorphs) were shown to form two groups: one that includes mostly floricolous, insect-associated species distributed in mostly tropical areas (the large-spored Metschnikowia clade and relatives) and another that comprises more heterogeneous species in terms of habitat and geographical distribution. Reconstruction of character evolution suggests that sexual characters (ascospore length, number of ascospores, and ascus formation) evolved multiple times within Metschnikowia. Complex and dynamic habitat transitions seem to have punctuated the course of evolution of the Metschnikowiaceae with repeated and independent origins of angiosperm-associated habitats. The origin of the family is placed in the Late Cretaceous (71.7 Ma) with most extant species arising from the Early Eocene. Therefore, the Metschnikowiaceae likely radiated long after the Mid-Cretaceous radiations of angiosperms and their diversification seems to be driven by repeated radiation on a pre-existing diverse resource.

A comment on Harrison	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	bacteria fitness kin selection phenotypic plasticity siderophore	PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA COOPERATION PARASITES VIRULENCE EVOLUTION BEHAVIOR	Micro-organisms are known to exhibit phenotypic plasticity in response to changes in their environment. Recent studies have shown that a parasite strain can adjust its host exploitation strategies to the presence of unrelated strains, e.g. for Plasmodium chabaudi by adjusting its sex-ratio. J. Evol. Biol. 2013 26: 1370-1378 claims to report a similar plastic response to the presence of unrelated strains in the case of siderophore-producing bacteria. I argue that she does not provide sufficient evidence to support the interpretation of the plastic response she observes (increasing siderophore production in the presence of cheaters) through a cooperator/cheater framework. I show that known plastic responses to physicochemical factors, such as siderophore or iron concentration, seem to offer a clearer and more parsimonious explanation. Finally, I also challenge the parallel she makes between the process she observes in siderophore-producing bacteria and compensation in bi-parental care models.

Similar to a nuclear genome, the entire bacterial assemblage maintains an ancestral signal of the host's evolution leading to cophylogeny between the host and the microbes they harbour (Brucker & Bordenstein 2012b). The stability of such associations is of great interest as they provide a means for species to acquire new traits and genetic diversity that their own genomes lack (McFall-Ngai etal. 2013). The role of gut microbiota, for example, in host health and nutrition is widely recognized and a shared characteristic among animals. The role of bacteria colonizing the outside surfaces of animals is less well understood, but rather than random colonization, these microbes on skin, cuticles, scales and feathers in many cases provide benefits to the host. The symbiosis of leaf-cutter ants, their fungus gardens and their microbiota is a fascinating and complex system. Whether culture-independent bacterial diversity on the cuticle of leaf-cutter ants is high or highly constrained by subcuticular gland secretions is one prominent question. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Andersen etal. (2013) show that leaf-cutting ants, Acromyrmex echinatior, maintain a dominant and colony-specific bacterium called Pseudonocardia on their cuticles (the laterocervical plates in particular). This bacterium is involved in protecting the ants and their fungal gardens from disease. Other fungus-gardening attine species as well as soil and vegetation can harbour Pseudonocardia. However, it was previously unknown how stable the bacterial strain-ant colony association was through the lifetime of the colony.

Frequent gains and losses of miRNA genes have been reported to occur during evolution. However, little is known systematically about the periods of evolutionary origin of the present miRNA gene repertoire of an extant mammalian species. Thus, in this study, we estimated the evolutionary periods during which each of 1,433 present human miRNA genes originated within 15 periods, from human to platypus-human common ancestral branch and a class conserved beyond theria, priMarchily using multiple genome alignments of 38 species, plus the pairwise genome alignments of five species. The results showed two peak periods in which the human miRNA genes originated at significantly accelerated rates. The most accelerated rate appeared in the period of the initial phase of hominoid lineage, and the second appeared shortly before Laurasiatherian divergence. Approximately 53% of the present human miRNA genes have originated within the simian lineage to human. In particular, approximately 28% originated within the hominoid lineage. The early phase of placental mammal radiation comprises approximately 28%, while no more than 15% of human miRNAs have been conserved beyond placental mammals. We also clearly showed a general trend, in which the miRNA expression level Decemberreases as the miRNA becomes younger. Intriguingly, amid this Decemberreasing trend of expression, we found one significant rise in the expression level that corresponded to the initial phase of the hominoid lineage, suggesting that increased functional acquisitions of miRNAs originated at this particular period.

Among them, miR-1, miR-206, and miR-133, which are encoded as bicistronic gene clusters in the genome, play major roles in the control of vertebrate myogenesis. To address how the gene organization and function of these miRs evolved, we identified their homologues in the cyclostomes, the chondrichthyans and the teleosts, and examined their patterns of expression during development. It was suggested that the chondrichthyans and the cyclostome lampreys possess fewer miR-1/miR-133 genes than the medaka. The medaka additionally possessed the miR-206 gene which was not found in the genomes of chondrichthyans and lampreys. In contrast, the number and genomic organization of medaka miR-1(206)/miR-133 were similar to those found in mammals. In the lamprey, shark and medaka, miR-1 and miR-133 were expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle cells in adults, a developmental feature traced back to chordate invertebrates such as ascidians. We further examined the expression of these miRs in different muscle tissues in medaka embryos. miR-206 was expressed in both the tail and pectoral fin muscles, whereas miR-1, which shares the similar nucleotide sequence with miR-206, was not detectable in the embryonic pectoral fins. Comparison of the relative positions with the neighboring protein-coding genes showed high conservation of synteny between the miR-1(206)/miR-133 clusters in a single species, as well as across the vertebrate taxa. Our results suggest that, after the gene duplications, these muscle-specific miRs acquired differential regulatory functions and have contributed to the establishment of diverse and complex musculature of vertebrates.

The goal of this project was to ask whether the theoretical association between antemortem tooth loss and uniquely human behaviors is supported empirically in a large skeletal sample of human hunter-gatherers, chimpanzees, orangutans, and baboons. Binomial regression modeling in a Bayesian framework allows for the investigation of the effects of tooth class, genus, age, and sex on the likelihood of tooth loss. The results strongly suggest that modern humans experience more antemortem tooth loss than non-human primates and identify age in years as an important predictor. Once age is accounted for, the difference between the humans and the closest non-human genus (chimpanzees) is less pronounced humans are still more likely on average to experience antemortem tooth loss though 95% uncertainty envelopes around the average prediction for each genus show some overlap. These analyses support theoretical links between antemortem tooth loss and modern human characteristics humans' significantly longer life history and a positive correlation between age and antemortem tooth loss explain, in part, the reason why humans are more likely to experience tooth loss than non-human primates, but the results do not exclude behavioral differences as a contributing factor.

Despite its importance, migratory connectivity is poorly estimated for most species. Traditionally, visual observations and bird ringing have been used to monitor migration, but these methods require more effort for relatively little return. Genetic Marchkers and stable isotope signatures have increasingly been used to study connectivity. Each approach has its distinct strengths and weaknesses, and as is often the case, a combination may yield the most insight. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Rundel and colleagues (2013) present a Novemberel Bayesian statistical framework in which genetics and stable isotope data can be combined to improve the assignment of individuals to different winter or breeding regions. The development of such new statistical methods combined with the increasing number and ease of access of isotopic and genetic data sets will greatly enhance our understanding of migratory connectivity. Add to this the developments of miniature devices to track movements of individuals, and the field is destined to make major progression in the Decemberades to come.

Evolutionary biologists have been fascinated by miniaturization because this transition has occurred numerous times, often among close relatives, providing a model system for studying convergent evolution and its underlying mechanisms. Much of the developmental work describing the ontogeny of miniature species suggests that paedomorphosis is the predominant avenue of miniaturization. Nevertheless, specific alterations to ontogeny appear highly variable, so that even related lineages with similar miniaturized traits produce those similarities via distinct ontogenetic paths. One major vertebrate group that has been overlooked in research on miniaturization is turtles. In the present study, we examined patterns of shape change in the plastron (the ventral part of the shell) over the course of ontogeny in a small clade of turtles (Emydinae) aiming to investigate whether two independently evolved diminutive members of the clade (Glyptemys muhlenbergii and Clemmys guttata) should be considered as miniaturized. We employ geometric morphometric methods to quantify the patterns of shape change these potentially miniaturized species and their relatives undergo during ontogeny, and use molecular phylogenetic trees to reconstruct ancestral conditions and provide information on the polarity of shape changes. We find that differing changes in ontogenetic parameters relative to ancestral conditions accompany the evolution of small size in emydines: G.muhlenbergii changes the duration of ontogeny and rate of shape change, whereas C.guttata changes growth rate. The observed ontogenetic repatterning of these species is reminiscent of changes in ontogeny and life history often found in miniaturized taxa. However, we conclude that C.guttata and G.muhlenbergii are not truly miniaturized because they still produce typical adult shell morphologies, and larger emydines display comparable ontogenetic flexibility. Because no emydines carry juvenile shell features forward into adulthood, we speculate that few, if any turtles, will show paedomorphic shell traits without corresponding changes in defensive strategy because such shells may offer insufficient protection.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London	June 22, 2013The Ancient and Widespread Nature of the ER-Mitochondria Encounter Structure	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION	ERMES complex organelle evolution hydrogenosomes and mitosomes ER-mitochondria contacts	ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM PREPROTEIN TRANSLOCASE MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD TRYPANOSOMA-BRUCEI EUKARYOTIC TREE OUTER-MEMBRANE LIPID EXCHANGE MIXED MODELS PROTEINS MORPHOLOGY	Mitochondria are the result of a billion years of integrative evolution, converting a once free-living bacterium to an organelle deeply linked to diverse cellular processes. One way in which mitochondria are integrated with nonendosymbiotically derived organelles is via endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact sites. The ER membrane is physically tethered to the mitochondrial outer membrane by the ER-mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES). However, to date, ERMES has only ever been found in the fungal lineage. Here, we bioinformatically demonstrate that ERMES is present in lineages outside Fungi and validate this inference by mass spectrometric identification of ERMES components in Acanthamoeba castellanii mitochondria. We further demonstrate that ERMES is retained in hydrogenosome-bearing but not mitosome-bearing organisms, yielding insight into the process of reductive mitochondrial evolution. Finally, we find that the taxonomic distribution of ERMES is most consistent with rooting the eukaryotic tree between Amorphea (Animals + Fungi + Amoebozoa) + Excavata and all other eukaryotes (Diaphoratickes).

Forcing each site to belong to one of these classes places unrealistic constraints on the distribution of selection parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an approximate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Marchkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined site classes. This leaves the distribution of selection parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows sites experiencing positive and purifying selection to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when sites assigned to the same site class experience different levels of positive or purifying selection-an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of site classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to analyze larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 sequences). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest HyPhy distribution (http://www.hyphy.org), as well as on the Datamonkey web server ( http://www.datamonkey.org/).

Studies may include measures of body size but typically group individuals into size/age classes or compare populations. Such broad comparisons may obscure the details of interactions that ultimately determine how socially contingent characteristics evolve. We propose that understanding cannibalism is facilitated by using an interacting phenotypes perspective that includes the influences of the phenotype of a social partner on the behaviour of a focal individual and focuses on variation in individual pairwise interactions. We investigated how relative body size, a composite trait between a focal individual and its social partner, and the sex of the partners influenced precannibalistic aggression in the endangered Socorro isopod, Thermosphaeroma thermophilum. We also investigated whether differences in mating interest among males and females influenced cannibalism in mixed sex pairs. We studied these questions in three populations that differ Marchkedly in range of body size and opportunities for interactions among individuals. We found that relative body size influences the probability of and latency to attack. We observed differences in the likelihood of and latency to attack based on both an individual's sex and the sex of its partner but found no evidence of sexual conflict. The instigation of precannibalistic aggression in these isopods is therefore a property of both an individual and its social partner. Our results suggest that interacting phenotype models would be improved by incorporating a new conditional , which describes the strength of a social partner's influence on focal behaviour.

Moreover, fossil studies rarely distinguish between the effects of atmospheric CO2 and temperature, which limits their ability to identify the causal controls on biodiversity. Plants are excellent organisms for testing climate-diversity hypotheses owing to their strong sensitivity to CO2, temperature and moisture. We find that pollen morphospecies richness in an angiosperm-dominated record from the Palaeogene and early Neogene (65-20 Ma) of Colombia and Venezuela correlates positively to CO2 much more strongly than to temperature (both tropical sea surface temperatures and estimates of global mean surface temperature). The weaker sensitivity to temperature may be due to reduced variance in long-term climate relative to in higher latitudes, or to the occurrence of lethal or sub-lethal temperatures during the warmest times of the Eocene. Physiological models predict that productivity should be the most sensitive to CO2 within the angiosperms, a prediction supported by our analyses if productivity is linked to species richness however, evaluations of non-angiosperm assemblages are needed to more completely test this idea.

JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	inclusive fitness life history evolution maternal effects nongenetic effects offspring size theory	EGG SIZE OFFSPRING SIZE LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY MATERNAL INVESTMENT PROPAGULE SIZE CLUTCH SIZE DISPERSAL NUMBER POPULATIONS	Models of parental investment typically assume that populations are well mixed and homogeneous and have devoted little attention to the impact of spatial variation in the local environment. Here, in a patch-structured model with limited dispersal, we assess to what extent resource-rich and resource-poor mothers should alter the size of their young in response to the local environment in their patch. We show that limited dispersal leads to a correlation between maternal and offspring environments, which favours plastic adjustment of offspring size in response to local survival risk. Strikingly, however, resource-poor mothers are predicted to respond more strongly to local survival risk, whereas resource-rich mothers are predicted to respond less strongly. This lack of sensitivity on the part of resource-rich mothers is favoured because they accrue much of their fitness through dispersing young. By contrast, resource-poor mothers accrue a larger fraction of their fitness through philopatric young and should therefore respond more strongly to local risk. Mothers with more resources gain a larger share of their fitness through dispersing young partly because their fitness in the local patch is constrained by the limited number of local breeding spots. In addition, when resource variation occurs at the patch level, the philopatric offspring of resource-rich mothers face stronger competition from the offspring of other local mothers, who also enjoy abundant resources. The effect of limited local breeding opportunities becomes less pronounced as patch size increases, but the impact of patch-level variation in resources holds up even with many breeders per patch.

I measured the strength of assortative mating within a species complex of Tilapia in Lake Ejagham, Cameroon, a celebrated example of incipient sympatric adaptive radiation. This species complex is in the earliest stages of speciation: morphological and ecological divergence are incomplete, species differ priMarchily in breeding coloration, and introgression is common. I captured 27 mated pairs in situ and measured the diet, color, size, and morphology of each individual. I found strong assortative mating by color, size, head depth, and dietary source of benthic or pelagic prey along two independent dimensions of assortment. Thus, Ejagham Tilapia showed strong assortative mating most conducive to sympatric speciation. Nonetheless, in contrast to a morphologically bimodal Sarotherodon cichlid species pair in the lake, Ejagham Tilapia show more limited progress toward speciation, likely due to insufficient strength of disruptive selection on morphology estimated in a previous study ( = 0.16). This supports the predicted dependence of sympatric speciation on strong assortment and strong disruptive selection by examining a potentially stalled example in nature.

To unravel the causes for the patterns of extreme inconsistencies at the base of the metazoan tree of life, we constructed a Novemberel supermatrix containing 122 genes, enriched with non-bilaterian taxa. Comparative analyses of this supermatrix and its two non-overlapping multi-gene partitions (including ribosomal and non-ribosomal genes) revealed conflicting phylogenetic signals. We show that the levels of saturation and long branch attraction artifacts in the two partitions correlate with gene sampling. The ribosomal gene partition exhibits significantly lower saturation levels than the non-ribosomal one. Additional systematic errors derive from significant variations in amino acid substitution patterns among the metazoan lineages that violate the stationarity assumption of evolutionary models frequently used to reconstruct phylogenies. By modifying gene sampling and the taxonomic composition of the outgroup, we were able to construct three different yet well-supported phylogenies. These results show that the accuracy of phylogenetic inference may be substantially improved by selecting genes that evolve slowly across the Metazoa and applying more realistic substitution models. Additional sequence-independent genomic Marchkers are also necessary to assess the validity of the phylogenetic hypotheses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although this phenomenon is of greatest importance, it has rarely been investigated and quantified. It is especially crucial for taxonomy and incidentally for biodiversity analyses to account for it, because otherwise, the number of described species might exceed that of actual species within any group. Early ammonoids (Early Devonian, Paleozoic) typically suffer from this bias. For instance, most specimens from the same layer and the same region (e.g., the Erbenoceras beds of the Moroccan eastern Anti-Atlas studied here) differ morphologically from each other. Depending on the importance given to certain morphological characters, therefore, one could create a new species for almost every specimen. In this study, we measured nearly 100 such specimens from a restricted stratigraphic interval and quantified their intraspecific variability. There is a variable but strong overlap of the quantified shell characters at most ontogenetic stages, and only two species are here Septemberarated rather than the four previously recognized in Morocco. When ontogenetic trajectories of the Moroccan specimens are compared with coeval faunas from other regions (assigned to other species), a strong overlap between the morphospaces occupied by these taxa becomes apparent. The justification of some of these latter species is thus questionable even if their mean values in some conch parameters differ considerably from the mean values of the Moroccan species. Hence, the number of currently valid species of these loosely coiled early ammonoids is probably much too high. Extreme caution must therefore be taken when examining the diversity of groups in which the intraspecific variability is poorly known.

We integrate this theoretical framework with field observations and laboratory experiments involving the sexually size dimorphic fishing spider, Dolomedes tenebrosus, to test the prediction that this species exhibits monogyny. Field surveys revealed a male-biased sex ratio, likely resulting from different life-history strategies (early male maturation). Results from mating trials supported our prediction of monogyny as we discovered that males mate with a single female. Unexpectedly, however, we observed that mating results in obligate male death and genital mutilation. Additional field observations of released individuals suggest that males are not limited by their ability to encounter additional females. Controlled laboratory assays demonstrated that males discriminate among virgin and non-virgin female silk cues, consistent with predictions of first-male sperm precedence. In sumMarchy, we report a Novemberel case of male self-sacrifice in a species that exhibits female-biased sexual size dimorphism, male-biased sex ratio, genital mutilation and a suggestion of first-male sperm precedence all of which are consistent with theoretical predictions of the evolution of monogyny.

Cases of divergent evolution, where there is morphological divergence between closely related species exploiting different environments, are less well studied. Here we show divergent evolution in the morphology of the proximal phalanges of several closely related African antelope species inhabiting different environments. This morphological divergence was consistently observed in both a neutral morphospace and an externally ordinated morphospace. Divergence, but not convergence, was also observed when size and shape were considered independently. Finally, convergent evolution of the morphology of the proximal phalanges was observed, but only in the externally ordinated morphospace. Size shows less correlation with phylogeny than does shape. Therefore, we suggest that divergence in size will occur more readily when a species encounters new environmental conditions than divergence in shape. These findings are compatible with observations of rapid dwarfing on islands (Foster's rule).

In particular, adaptive morphological convergence is common in small, highly diverse invertebrate taxa sharing similar life history strategies such as parasitoidism. The genus Notiospathius is a braconid parasitoid wasp group with a vast, undetermined number of species distributed throughout the Neotropics. Members of this genus possess a considerably elongated, petiolate first metasomal tergite. This structure, however, also occurs in species of other doryctine genera, both closely and distantly related, probably due to adaptation for attacking wood and bark boring coleopteran larvae. Here we investigated the phylogenetic relationships among 117 species assigned to Notiospathius, including species of its closely related genera Masonius and Tarasco, as well as members of a number of other dotyctine genera in order to test its monophyly. Septemberarate and concatenated Bayesian partitioned analyses were carried out using two mitochondrial and three nuclear gene Marchkers. The influence of each gene on the overall topology was verified using a cross-validation analysis for each Marchker with a leave-one-out approach. Moreover, the historical biogeography of Notiospathius was assessed calculating divergence time estimates of clades with BEAST and performing ancestral area reconstruction analyses both with RASP (Bayesian and S-DIVA) and Lagrange (December). All analyses recovered a polyphyletic Notiospathius consisting of three Septemberarate clades that were more related to other doryctine genera than to each other. The relationships reconstructed could not be used to confidently establish the limits of Notiospathius with respect to its closely related genera Tarasco and Masonius, and thus the generic status of the latter two taxa is maintained. Our divergence time estimates and ancestral area reconstructions indicate that the most recent common ancestor of Notiospathius sensu stricto originated in the Caribbean subregion during the Oligocene-Miocene boundary, and subsequently diversified during the mid- to late Miocene, radiating throughout the Neotropics.

This study begins to investigate this link by comparing integration among shoulder girdle elements (e.g. scapular blade, glenoid, coracoid, etc.) during the origin and evolution of therian mammals, and within modern bat, opossum and mouse populations. In this study, correlations among skeletal elements and patterns of allometry are used as proxies for integration. Results suggest that shoulder girdle elements tended to vary and evolve independently during the origin of mammals and subsequent radiation of placentals, consistent with the elements' distinct developmental and evolutionary origins. This finding suggests that skeletal element correlations, and therefore integration, can be conserved over large taxonomic and temporal scales. However, Marchsupials display a different pattern in which shoulder girdle elements tend to be more integrated, with the exception of the coracoid. This finding is consistent with a shift in the pattern of skeletal element integration coincident with the appearance of the Marchsupial mode of reproduction. This finding provides further evidence that development can play a significant role in the establishment of patterns of skeletal element correlation and that patterns of skeletal element correlation can themselves evolve when faced with sufficient selective pressures.

In this work we examine the differences between the use of two- and three-dimensional morphometric techniques for the analysis of macroevolutionary patterns of morphological variation in the mandible of the South American caviomorph rodents, which displays varying degrees of hystricognathy. The variation patterns were similar for 2D and 3D coordinate datasets. However, phylogenetic comparative statistical analyses showed widely different results for mandible variation. Both the phylogenetic signal values and the results of phylogenetic regressions were Marchkedly different between the two macroevolutionary mandible datasets. This suggests that the inclusion of the third coordinate to characterize a hystricognathous mandible may lead to completely different interpretations concerning the processes that could be regulating the morphological diversification of the caviomorph mandible. We also compare these results with the 2D and 3D macroevolutionary patterns of variation in cranial shape and the intra-specific mandible variation. The variation patterns were similar for 2D and 3D coordinate for all these comparative datasets. The differing results obtained at different evolutionary scales, give strength to the statement about careful selection of data not only in studies of morphological variation in caviomorphs but also for other groups of organisms.

November. et sp. November. from the late Early Cretaceous of northeastern Brazil, and extant aquatic flowering plants are comparatively studied. Characteristic features indicate that Jaguariba gen. November. is a member of Nymphaeaceae, and may belong to Nymphaeoideae. The occurrence of both Nymphaeaceae and Cabombaceae (e.g., Pluricarpellatia peltata) in the Lower Cretaceous contradicts recent molecular dating implying a Late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary divergence for those families. Furthermore, the morphology of the fossil and sedimentologic and taphonomic data indicate that Jaguariba gen. November. had an aquatic ecology similar to living Nymphaeaceae. Thus the taxon was part of the aquatic vegetation of the Crato lake in association with Pluricarpellatia peltata, an earlier described cabombaceaen aquatic angiosperm.

Together with a mere handful of like-minded scientists, Morris established himself as a leader in the molecular phylogenetic revolution of the 1960s. The effects of this revolution are most evident in this journal, which he founded in 1992. Happily for lemur biologists, one of Morris Goodman's priMarchy interests was in reconstructing the phylogeny of the primates, including the tooth-combed Lorisifomes of Africa and Asia, and the Lemuriformes of Madagascar (collectively referred to as the suborder Strepsirrhini). This paper traces the development of molecular phylogenetic and evolutionary genetic trends and methods over the 50-year expanse of Morris Goodman's career, particularly as they apply to our understanding of lemuriform phylogeny, biogeography, and biology. Notably, this perspective reveals that the lemuriform genome is sufficiently rich in phylogenetic signal such that the very earliest molecular phylogenetic studies many of which were conducted by Goodman himself have been validated by contemporary studies that have exploited advanced computational methods applied to phylogenomic scale data studies that were beyond imagining in the earliest days of phylogeny reconstruction. Nonetheless, the frontier still beckons. New technologies for gathering and analyzing genomic data will allow investigators to build upon what can now be considered a nearly-known phylogeny of the Lemuriformes in order to ask inNovemberative questions about the evolutionary mechanisms that generate and maintain the extraordinary breadth and depth of biological diversity within this reMarchkable clade of primates.

However, a collection of small effect mutations could have a large effect on a given biological pathway that includes many genes, and such a polygenic mode of adaptation has not been systematically investigated in humans. We propose here to evidence polygenic selection by detecting signals of adaptation at the pathway or gene set level instead of analyzing single independent genes. Using a gene-set enrichment test to identify genome-wide signals of adaptation among human populations, we find that most pathways globally enriched for signals of positive selection are either directly or indirectly involved in immune response. We also find evidence for long-distance genotypic linkage disequilibrium, suggesting functional epistatic interactions between members of the same pathway. Our results show that past interactions with pathogens have elicited widespread and coordinated genomic responses, and suggest that adaptation to pathogens can be considered as a priMarchy example of polygenic selection.

The residual yolk is internalized before emergence from the egg is completed and the yolk is subsequently metabolized during early neonatal life. Here we provide the first description of the mechanism of yolk internalization in non-avian reptiles. We describe the hatching of two lizard species (Physignathus lesueurii and Varanus rosenbergii) and provide a step-by-step account of sequence of events leading to yolk internalization and emergence from the egg. We also conducted incubation experiments to determine the cause of failed yolk internalization. Contraction of the ruptured amnion is the mechanism by which the residual yolk is internalized, which provides an explanation for the functional significance of amniotic contractions. Failures of internalization occur when the amount of residual yolk exceeds that which can be enclosed by the ruptured amnion. We conclude that, because of the connections formed between the amnion and both the allantois and chorion, the pipping and retraction of the amnion pulls the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) off the surface of the eggshell, which impairs the capacity for gas exchange and forces the embryo to breach the eggshell to commence breathing. We further speculate that the loss of amniotic contractions in mammals may indicate an incompatibility of amnion-assisted yolk internalization with viviparity, an evolutionary process that could be tested by examining viviparous squamates.

These oversimplified assumptions are refuted by the observation that compositional variability characterizes extant biological sequences. Branch-heterogeneous models of protein evolution that account for compositional variability have been developed, but are not yet in common use because of the large number of parameters required, leading to high computational costs and potential overparameterization. Here, we present a new branch-nonhomogeneous and nonstationary model of protein evolution that captures more accurately the high complexity of sequence evolution. This model, henceforth called Correspondence and likelihood analysis (COaLA), makes use of a correspondence analysis to reduce the number of parameters to be optimized through maximum likelihood, focusing on most of the compositional variation observed in the data. The model was thoroughly tested on both simulated and biological data sets to show its high performance in terms of data fitting and CPU time. COaLA efficiently estimates ancestral amino acid frequencies and sequences, making it relevant for studies aiming at reconstructing and resurrecting ancestral amino acid sequences. Finally, we applied COaLA on a concatenate of universal amino acid sequences to confirm previous results obtained with a nonhomogeneous Bayesian model regarding the early pattern of adaptation to optimal growth temperature, supporting the mesophilic nature of the Last Universal Common Ancestor.

However, a growing number of papers report simultaneous ecological and evolutionary change, suggesting that the eco-evolutionary consequences of environmental change for populations can only be fully understood through the simultaneous analysis of statistics used to describe both ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Here we argue that integral projection models (IPM), and matrix approximations of them, provide a powerful approach to integrate population ecology, life history theory, and evolution. We discuss key questions in population biology that can be examined using these models, the answers to which are essential for a general, population-level understanding of eco-evolutionary change.

Recent studies demonstrate that MSA algorithms can produce different outcomes when analyzing genomes, including phylogenetic tree inference and the detection of adaptive evolution. These studies also suggest that the difference between MSA algorithms is of a similar order to the uncertainty within an algorithm and suggest integrating across this uncertainty. In this study, we examine further the problem of disagreements between MSA algorithms and how they affect downstream analyses. We also investigate whether integrating across alignment uncertainty affects downstream analyses. We address these questions by analyzing 200 chordate gene families, with properties reflecting those used in large-scale genomic analyses. We find that newly developed distance metrics reveal two significantly different classes of MSA methods (MSAMs). The similarity-based class includes progressive aligners and consistency aligners, representing many methodological inNovemberations for sequence alignment, whereas the evolution-based class includes phylogenetically aware alignment and statistical alignment. We proceed to show that the class of an MSAM has a substantial impact on downstream analyses. For phylogenetic inference, tree estimates and their branch lengths appear highly dependent on the class of aligner used. The number of families, and the sites within those families, inferred to have undergone adaptive evolution depend on the class of aligner used. Similarity-based aligners tend to identify more adaptive evolution. We also develop and test methods for incorporating MSA uncertainty when detecting adaptive evolution but find that although accounting for MSA uncertainty does affect downstream analyses, it appears less important than the class of aligner chosen. Our results demonstrate the critical role that MSA methodology has on downstream analysis, highlighting that the class of aligner chosen in an analysis has a demonstrable effect on its outcome.

Based on estimates of synonymous nucleotide diversity in Escherichia coli, a recent study claimed that the per-nucleotide mutation rate in a gene Decemberreases with the rise of its expression level or the intensity of purifying selection and that this trend reflects adaptive risk management. Here, we demonstrate that this argument is theoretically untenable, especially in the lack of mechanisms that simultaneously tune the mutabilities of multiple genes with similar fractions of deleterious mutations. Analyzing published genome sequences of E. coli mutation accumulation lines, we show that mutation rates are actually higher in more highly expressed genes, similar to previous genome-wide observations in Salmonella typhimurium, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the human germline. These general patterns likely arise from transcription-associated mutagenesis that exceeds transcription-coupled repair.

In the context of antibiotic resistance, the resulting genotype-by-environment interactions potentially make selection on resistance unpredictable in heterogeneous environments. Furthermore, resistant bacteria frequently fix additional mutations during evolution in the absence of antibiotics. How do these two types of mutations interact to determine the bacterial phenotype across different environments? To address this, I used Escherichia coli as a model system, measuring the effects of nine different rifampicin resistance mutations on bacterial growth in 31 antibiotic-free environments. I did this both before and after approximately 200 generations of experimental evolution in antibiotic-free conditions (LB medium), and did the same for the antibiotic-sensitive wild type after adaptation to the same environment. The following results were observed: (i) bacteria with and without costly resistance mutations adapted to experimental conditions and reached similar levels of competitive fitness (ii) rifampicin resistance mutations and adaptation to LB both indirectly altered growth in other environments and (iii) resistant-evolved genotypes were more phenotypically different from the ancestor and from each other than resistant-nonevolved and sensitive-evolved genotypes. This suggests genotype-by-environment interactions generated by antibiotic resistance mutations, observed previously in short-term experiments, are more pronounced after adaptation to other types of environmental variation, making it difficult to predict long-term selection on resistance mutations from fitness effects in a single environment.

The coevolution of plant reward and animal choosiness, however, involves an apparent paradox due to incomplete information and limited mutation rates: plant rewards evolve only when animals are choosy, but choosy animals purge the heritable variations of plants, which then favors less choosy animals. Here we use a two-species mathematical model to illustrate how non-heritable phenotypic variances of plants may facilitate the coevolution of rewards and choosiness and solve the paradox with low mutation rates. We simultaneously track the ecological and evolutionary dynamics and show that the population ratio links the two processes and tunes the stable ecoevolutionary equilibrium. Numerical simulations confirm the analytic prediction with varying mutation rates (heritable variance). The efficiency of a biological Marchket is generally suboptimal due to the information constraint and individual competition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

But these associations can only succeed if effective partners can be enticed to interact. In some mutualisms, partners can actively seek one another out. However, plants, which use mutualists for a wide array of essential life history functions, do not have this option. Instead, natural selection has repeatedly favoured the evolution of rewards - nutritional substances (such as sugar-rich nectar and fleshy fruit) with which plants attract certain organisms whose feeding activities can then be co-opted for their own benefit. The trouble with rewards, however, is that they are usually also attractive to organisms that confer no benefits at all. Losing rewards to 'exploiters' makes a plant immediately less attractive to the mutualists it requires if the reward cannot be renewed quickly (or at all), then mutualistic service is precluded entirely. Thus, it is in plants' interests to either restrict rewards to only the most beneficial partners or somehow punish or deter exploiters. Yet, at least in cases where the rewards are highly nutritious, we can expect counter-selection for exploiter traits that permit them to skirt such control. How, then, can mutualisms persist? In this issue, Orona-Tamayo et al. (2013) describe a reMarchkable adaptation that safeguards one particularly costly reward from nonmutualists. Their study helps to explain the evolutionary success of an iconic interaction and illuminates one way in which mutualism as a whole can persist in the face of exploitation.

We investigated how the FBs are protected from exploiting nonmutualists. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the FB proteomes and consecutive protein sequencing indicated the presence of several Kunitz-type protease inhibitors (PIs). PIs extracted from Acacia FBs were biologically active, as they effectively reduced the trypsin-like and elastase-like proteolytic activity in the guts of seed-feeding beetles (Prostephanus truncatus and Zabrotes subfasciatus), which were used as non-adapted herbivores representing potential exploiters. By contrast, the legitimate mutualistic consumers maintained high proteolytic activity dominated by chymotrypsin 1, which was insensitive to the FB PIs. Larvae of an exploiter ant (Pseudomyrmex gracilis) taken from Acacia hosts exhibited lower overall proteolytic activity than the mutualists. The proteases of this exploiter exhibited mainly elastase-like and to a lower degree chymotrypsin 1-like activity. We conclude that the mutualist ants possess specifically those proteases that are least sensitive to the PIs in their specific food source, whereas the congeneric exploiter ant appears partly, but not completely, adapted to consume Acacia FBs. By contrast, any consumption of the FBs by non-adapted exploiters would effectively inhibit their digestive capacities. We suggest that the term 'exclusive rewards' can be used to describe situations similar to the one that has evolved in myrmecophytic Acacia species, which reward mutualists with FBs but safeguard the reward from exploitation by generalists by making the FBs difficult for the nonadapted consumer to use.

The genus Sphaerospora Thelohan, 1892, which includes pathogenic species that cause significant impacts on fisheries and aquaculture, is one of the most polyphyletic taxa and exemplifies the current challenges facing myxozoan taxonomists. The type species, S. elegans, clusters within the Sphaerospora sensu stricto clade, members of which share similar tissue tropism and long insertions in their variable rRNA gene regions. However, other morphologically similar sphaerosporids lie in different branches of myxozoan phylogenetic trees. Herein, we significantly extend taxonomic sampling of sphaerosporids with SSU + LSU rDNA and EF-2 sequence data for 12 taxa including three representatives of the morphologically similar genus Polysporoplasma Sitja-Bobadilla et Alvarez-Pellitero, 1995. These taxa were sampled from different vertebrate host groups, biogeographic realms and environments. Our phylogenetic analyses and statistical tests of single and concatenated datasets revealed Sphaerospora s. s. as a strongly supported monophyletic lineage, that clustered sister to the whole myxosporean clade (freshwater + Marchine lineages). Generally, Sphaerospora s. s. rDNA sequences (up to 3.7 kb) are the longest of all myxozoans and indeed metazoans. The sphaerosporid clade has two lineages, which have specific morphological, biological and sequence traits. Lineage A taxa (Marchine Sphaerospora spp.) have a single binucleate sporoplasm and shorter AT-rich rDNA inserts. Lineage B taxa (freshwater/brackish Sphaerospora spp. + Marchine/brackish Polysporoplasma spp.) have 2-12 uninucleate sporoplasms and longer GC-rich rDNA inserts. Lineage B has four subclades that correlate with host group and habitat all Polysporoplasma species, including the type species, cluster together in one of these subclades. We thus suppress the genus Polysporoplasma and the family Polysporoplasmidae and emend the generic diagnosis of the genus Sphaerospora. The combination of morphological, biological and DNA sequence data applied in this study helped to elucidate an important part of the taxonomic puzzle within the phylum Myxozoa.

In Archaea, the N-linked glycans that Decemberorate experimentally characterized glycoproteins reveal a diversity in composition and content unequaled by their bacterial or eukaryal counterparts. At the same time, relatively little is known of archaeal N-glycosylation pathways outside of a handful of model strains. To gain insight into the distribution and evolutionary history of the archaeal version of this universal protein-processing event, 168 archaeal genome sequences were scanned for the presence of agIB, encoding the known archaeal oligosaccharyltransferase, an enzyme key to N-glycosylation. Such analysis predicts the presence of AgIB in 166 species, with some species seemingly containing multiple versions of the protein. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the events leading to agIB duplication occurred at various points during archaeal evolution. In many cases, agIB is found as part of a cluster of putative N-glycosylation genes. The presence, arrangement and nucleotide composition of genes in agIB-based clusters in five species of the halophilic archaeon Haloferax points to lateral gene transfer as contributing to the evolution of archaeal N-glycosylation.

Particularly interesting are the Tupi and Je speaker dispersions. At present, a large number of individuals speak languages of these two stocks for instance, Tupi-Guarani is one of the official languages in Paraguay, Bolivia, and the Mercosul economic block. Although the Tupi expansion can be compared in importance to the Bantu migration in Africa, little is known about this event relative to others. Equal and even deeper gaps exist concerning the Je-speakers' expansion. This study aims to elucidate some aspects of these successful expansions. To meet this purpose, we analyzed Native American mtDNA complete control region from nine different populations and included HVS-I sequences available in the literature, resulting in a total of 1,176 samples investigated. Evolutionary relationships were explored through median-joining networks and genetic/geographic/linguistic correlations with Mantel tests and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Both Tupi and Je showed general traces of ancient or more recent fission-fusion processes, but a very different pattern of demographic expansion. Tupi populations displayed a classical isolation-by-distance pattern, while Je groups presented an intricate and nonlinear mode of dispersion. We suggest that the collective memory and other cultural processes could be important factors influencing the fission-fusion events, which likely contributed to the genetic structure, evolution, and dispersion of Native American populations.

The extension of structural differences between conformers characterizes the conformational diversity of the protein. In this study, we found a negative correlation between conformational diversity and protein evolutionary rate. Conformational diversity was expressed as the maximum root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the available conformers in Conformational Diversity of Native State database. Evolutionary rate estimations were calculated using 16 different species compared with human sharing at least 700 orthologous proteins with known conformational diversity extension. The negative correlation found is independent of the protein expression level and comparable in magnitude and sign with the correlation between gene expression level and evolutionary rate. Our findings suggest that the structural constraints underlying protein dynamism, essential for protein function, could modulate protein divergence.

In arvicoline rodents, hybridization is known to occur in the wild and/or in captivity. In the Microtus arvalis group, cytogenetic studies revealed that there were two distinct chromosomal forms (2n?=?46 but a different fundamental number of autosomes). These forms have been attributed to two cryptic species: the common (arvalis) and Altai (obscurus) voles. Recently, individuals with intermediate karyotypes (F1 and backcrosses) were discovered in central European Russia, and, for this reason, other studies have regarded obscurus and arvalis as conspecific. In the present study, to address the question of the species limits in the Altai vole and to infer its evolutionary history, a phylogeographical analysis combined with multivariate morphometric methods and original chromosome data was performed. Two obscurus lineages were identified: the Sino-Russian and South Caucasian lineages. Both lineages are characterized by low genetic diversity, resulting, in the former, from a past bottleneck event caused by encroaching periglacial areas and, in the latter, from recent rapid population divergence. Introgressive hybridization between the Altai and common voles appears to be the result of a secondary contact following the Last Glacial Maximum in central European Russia. Despite the fact that speciation is an ongoing process in most arvicoline species, the common and Altai voles are genetically divergent, morphologically and karyologically distinct, and exhibit contrasting evolutionary histories. For all these reasons, they should be ranked as species: M.?arvalis and M.?obscurus.

The flowers of some species possess spurs curving into a circle. However, it is unclear whether spur circle diameter is under direct selection pressure from different sources, such as pollinators and nectar robbers. In this study, we quantified selection on some floral traits, such as spur circle diameter in Impatiens oxyanthera (Balsaminaceae) using phenotypic selection analysis and compared the relative importance of pollinators and nectar robbers as selective agents using mediation analysis. The study showed that pollinators caused significant selection on corolla length, spur curvature and spur circle diameter while nectar robbers only imposed strong selection on spur circle diameter. Pollinators favored flowers with large corolla, curly spurs and large spur circle while nectar robbers preferred flowers with small spur circle. More pollinator visits resulted in higher female reproductive success, while robbery reduced female fitness. Conflicting selection on spur traits from pollinators and nectar robbers was not found. Mediation analysis showed that selection on floral traits through nectar robbing was stronger than selection through pollination. The results suggested that pollinators and nectar robbers jointly mediated the directional selection for large spur circle, and nectar robbers caused stronger selection than pollinators on floral traits.

Originally described as unrelated species, they have recently been interpreted as a clade their flexible tentacles, camera-type eyes, lateral fins, internal gills, axial cavity, and funnel point to a relationship with the cephalopods. However, aspects of this reinterpretation, including the relevance of the group to cephalopod evolution, have been called into question. Here, I examine new and existing nectocaridid material, including a large new form that may represent a sexual dimorph of Nectocaris pteryx. Differences between existing taxa largely represent taphonomic variation between sites and specimens-which provides further constraint on the organisms' anatomy. I revise the morphology of the tentacles and fins, and describe mouthparts and phosphatized gills for the first time. A mathematical analysis supports the presence of the earliest known camera-type eyes, and fluid mechanical considerations suggest that the funnel is optimized for efficient jet propulsion in a low Reynolds number flow regime. Nectocaridids closely resemble coleoid cephalopods, but a position deeper within Cephalopoda raises fewer stratigraphic challenges. Whether its coleoid-like construction reflects common ancestry or profound convergence, the Nectocaris body plan adds substantially to Cambrian disparity, demonstrating the rapid colonization of nektobenthic niches after the Cambrian explosion.

But only a small fraction of current molecular systematic studies methodically examine and effectively account for the potentially confounding effect of non-stationarity. The problem is especially overlooked in multi-locus or phylogenomic scale analyses, in part because no efficient tools exist to accommodate base composition heterogeneity in large data sets. We present a detailed analysis of a data set with 20 genes and 214 taxa to study the phylogeny of flatfishes (Pleuronectiformes) and their position among percomorphs. Most genes vary significantly in base composition among taxa and fail to resolve flatfish monophyly and other emblematic groups, suggesting that non-stationarity may be causing systematic error. We show a strong association between base compositional bias and topological discordance among individual gene partitions and their inferred trees. Phylogenetic methods applying non-homogeneous models to accommodate non-stationarity have relatively minor effect to reduce gene tree discordance, suggesting that available computer programs applying these methods do not scale up efficiently to the data set of modest size analysed in this study. By comparing phylogenetic trees obtained with species tree (STAR) and concatenation approaches, we show that gene tree discordance in our data set is most likely due to base compositional biases than to incomplete lineage sorting. Multi-locus analyses suggest that the combined phylogenetic signal from all loci in a concatenated data set overcomes systematic biases induced by non-stationarity at each partition. Finally, relationships among flatfishes and their relatives are discussed in the light of these results. We find support for the monophyly of flatfishes and confirm findings from previous molecular phylogenetic studies suggesting their close affinity with several carangimorph groups (i.e., jack and allies, barracuda, archerfish, billfish and swordfish, threadfin, moonfish, beach salmon, and snook and barramundi).

Here, we address these questions by analyzing patterns of regulatory variation in motifs for 177 DNA binding proteins in 37 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Between S. cerevisiae strains, we found considerable polymorphism in regulatory motifs across strains (mean pi = 0.005) as well as diversity in regulatory motifs (mean 0.91 motifs differences per regulatory region). Population genetics analyses reveal that motifs are under purifying selection, and there is considerable heterogeneity in the magnitude of selection across different motifs. Finally, we obtained RNA-Seq data in 22 strains and identified 49 polymorphic DNA sequence motifs in 30 distinct genes that are significantly associated with transcriptional differences between strains. In 22 of these genes, there was a single polymorphic motif associated with expression in the upstream region. Our results provide comprehensive insights into the evolutionary trajectory of regulatory variation in yeast and the characteristics of a compendium of regulatory alleles.

However, with the rapidly growing amount of data, this task remains a computational bottleneck. Recently, approximation methods such as the RAxML rapid bootstrap (RBS) and the Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test have been introduced to speed up the bootstrap. Here, we suggest an ultrafast bootstrap approximation approach (UFBoot) to compute the support of phylogenetic groups in maximum likelihood (ML) based trees. To achieve this, we combine the resampling estimated log-likelihood method with a simple but effective collection scheme of candidate trees. We also propose a stopping rule that assesses the convergence of branch support values to automatically determine when to stop collecting candidate trees. UFBoot achieves a median speed up of 3.1 (range: 0.66-33.3) to 10.2 (range: 1.32-41.4) compared with RAxML RBS for real DNA and amino acid alignments, respectively. Moreover, our extensive simulations show that UFBoot is robust against moderate model violations and the support values obtained appear to be relatively unbiased compared with the conservative standard bootstrap. This provides a more direct interpretation of the bootstrap support. We offer an efficient and easy-to-use software (available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree) to perform the UFBoot analysis with ML tree inference.

Species confined between various barriers (Atlas Mountains, arid environments such as the Sahara in the south, water masses such as the Mediterranean Sea in the north, and the Atlantic Ocean in the west) were generally forced to adapt locally to environmental changes instead of tracking their habitat by shifting their distribution area. The present study aims at providing first insight into the evolution of the genus Mus, and more specifically of the western Mediterranean species Mus spretus in this area. The study relies on the abundant Late Pleistocene and Middle Holocene fossil assemblage from the El Harhoura 2 cave (Rabat-TeMarcha, Morocco). This exceptional record was studied using geometric morphometrics applied to first upper and lower molars, constituting the most informative and best preserved fossil remains for such small rodents. Two main issues were addressed. (1) Geometric morphometrics was used to clarify taxonomic status and phylogenetic relationships among fossil and modern species in this area. Morphometric analysis revealed good discrimination of most modern and fossil species but failed to document intermediate forms tracing anagenetic evolution. Not mutually exclusive, the occurrence of complex processes of morphological evolution in this genus such as parallel evolution and the action of stabilizing selection may make it difficult to translate patterns of morphological evolution into phylogenetic conclusions. (2) The record was shown to document a sequence of intraspecific evolution of M.spretus. The morphology of the molars through the fossil record of El Harhoura 2 was surprisingly stable despite extensive modern variation. The limited temporal variation largely failed to correlate to palaeoenvironmental proxies. The mouse fossil record at El Harhoura 2 thus presents an intriguing case of morphological stasis despite extensive environmental changes. This long-term stability may have been recently perturbed by anthropogenic factors including landscape changes and introduction of various competitors and predators, leading to a size reduction.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 599-621.

SYMPATRIC STICKLEBACKS GASTEROSTEUS WHITEFISH COREGONUS ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION TRADE-OFFS THREESPINE STICKLEBACK FORAGING EFFICIENCY PARALLEL EVOLUTION GENETIC-DIVERGENCE SPECIES PAIRS	North temperate fish in post-glacial lakes are textbook examples for rapid parallel adaptive radiation into multiple trophic specialists within individual lakes. Speciation repeatedly proceeded along the benthic-limnetic habitat axis, and benthic-limnetic sister species diverge in the number of gill rakers. Yet, the utility of different numbers of gill rakers for consuming benthic vs. limnetic food has only very rarely been experimentally demonstrated. We bred and raised families of a benthic-limnetic species pair of whitefish under common garden conditions to test whether these species (i) show heritable differentiation in feeding efficiency on zooplankton, and (ii) whether variation in feeding efficiency is predicted by variation in gill raker numbers. We used zooplankton of three different size classes to investigate prey size dependency of divergence in feeding efficiency and to investigate the effect strength of variation in the number of gill rakers. Our results show strong interspecific differences in feeding efficiency. These differences are largest when fish were tested with the smallest zooplankton. Importantly, feeding efficiency is significantly positively correlated with the number of gill rakers when using small zooplankton, also when species identity is statistically controlled for. Our results support the hypothesis that a larger number of gill rakers are of adaptive significance for feeding on zooplankton and provide one of the first experimental demonstrations of trait utility of gill raker number when fish feed on zooplankton. These results are consistent with the suggested importance of divergent selection driven feeding adaptation during adaptive radiation of fish in post-glacial lakes.

A close genetic homogeneity was found within and between the Antarctic and Fuegian populations, while more significant levels of genetic differentiation were detected within and between the two Arctic populations, as well as between these populations and the Antarctic/Fuegian ones. The phylogeographical pattern that was derived from these data indicates that gene flow is not limited among Arctic populations it equally connects the Arctic and Antarctic populations either directly, or through the Fuegian population. This indication reinforces previous evidence from laboratory assays of mating interactions between some of the strains analysed in this work that Southern and Northern polar populations of E. nobilii belong to a unique, panmictic population that substantially share the same gene pool.

Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) is a common form of such manipulation, where a (currently uncharacterized) bacterial modification of male sperm induces the early death of embryos unless the fertilized eggs carry the same bacteria, inherited from the mother. The death of uninfected embryos provides an indirect selective advantage to infected ones, thus enabling the spread of the bacteria. Here we use and expand recently developed algorithms to infer the genetic architecture underlying the complex incompatibility data from the mosquito Culex pipiens. We show that CI requires more genetic determinants than previously believed and that quantitative variation in gene products potentially contributes to the observed CI patterns. In line with population genetic theory of CI, our analysis suggests that toxin factors (those inducing embryo death) are present in fewer copies in the bacterial genomes than antitoxin factors (those ensuring that infected embryos survive). In combination with comparative genomics, our approach will provide helpful guidance to identify the genetic basis of CI and more generally of other toxin/antitoxin systems that can be conceptualized under the same framework.

These models have greatly enhanced our understanding of evolutionary processes. Rarely are such models empirically tested in the laboratory, and even more rare, are such models exploited to generate Novemberel molecules useful for synthetic biology. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the heterotachy model of evolution captures signatures of functional divergence among homologous elongation factors (EFs) between bacterial EF-Tu and eukaryotic eEF1A. These EFs are GTPases that participate in protein translation by presenting aminoacylated-tRNAs to the ribosome. Upon release from the ribosome, the EFs are recharged by nucleotide exchange factors EF-Ts in bacteria or eEF1B in eukaryotes. The two nucleotide exchange factors perform analogous functions despite not being homologous proteins. The heterotachy model was used to identify a set of sites in eEF1A/EF-Tu associated with eEF1B binding in eukaryotes and another reciprocal set associated with EF-Ts binding in bacteria. Introduction of bacterial EF-Tu residues at these sites into eEF1A protein efficiently disrupted binding of cognate eEF1B as well as endowed eEF1A with the Novemberel ability to bind bacterial EF-Ts. We further demonstrate that eEF1A variants, unlike yeast wild-type, can function in a reconstituted in vitro bacterial translation system.

Range shifts typically involve the repeated establishment and growth of leading-edge populations well ahead of the main species range. How these populations recover from founder events and associated diversity loss remains poorly understood. To help fill this gap, we exhaustively investigated a newly established population of holm oak (Quercus ilex) growing more than 30 km ahead of the nearest larger stands. Pedigree reconstructions showed that plants belong to two non-overlapping generations and that the whole population originates from only two founder trees. The four first-generation trees that have reached maturity showed disparate mating patterns despite being full-sibs. Long-distance pollen immigration was notable despite the strong isolation of the stand: 6 per cent gene flow events in acorns collected on the trees (n = 255), and as much as 27 per cent among their established offspring (n = 33). Our results show that isolated leading-edge populations of wind-pollinated forest trees can rapidly restore their genetic diversity through the interacting effects of efficient long-distance pollen flow and purging of inbred individuals during recruitment. They imply that range expansions of these species are priMarchily constrained by initial propagule arrival rather than by subsequent gene flow.

In insects, smaller species are usually shown to be more specialized than larger-bodied ones. Various hypotheses have attempted to explain this pattern but rigorous proof of the body sizediet breadth relationship has been lacking, priMarchily because the scarceness of reliable phylogenetic information has precluded formal comparative analyses. Explicitly using phylogenetic information for a group of herbivores (geometrid moths) and their host plant range, we perform a comparative analysis to study the body sizediet breadth relationship. Considering several alternative measures of body size and diet breadth, our results convincingly demonstrate without previous methodological issuesa first for any taxona positive association between these traits, which has implications for evaluating various central aspects of the evolutionary ecology of herbivorous insects. We additionally demonstrate how the methods used in this study can be applied in assessing hypotheses to explain the body sizediet breadth relationship. By analyzing the relationship in tree-feeders alone and finding that the positive relationship remains, the result suggests that the body sizediet breadth relationship is not solely driven by the type of host plant that species feed on.

The resulting lower pH impairs the senses of reef fishes and reduces their survival, and might similarly impact commercially targeted fishes that produce most of the seafood eaten by humans. Shelled molluscs will also be negatively affected, whereas cephalopods and crustaceans will remain largely unscathed. Habitat changes will reduce seafood production from coral reefs, but increase production from seagrass and seaweed. Overall effects of ocean acidification on priMarchy productivity and, hence, on food webs will result in hard-to-predict winners and losers. Although adaptation, parental effects, and evolution can mitigate some effects of ocean acidification, future seafood platters will look rather different unless CO2 emissions are curbed.

Surprisingly, formal estimates of selection on offspring size are rare, and the degree to which selection (particularly nonlinear selection) varies among environments remains poorly explored. We estimate linear and nonlinear selection on offspring size, module size, and senescence rate for a sessile Marchine invertebrate in the field under three different intensities of interspecific competition. The intensity of competition strongly modified the strength and form of selection acting on offspring size. We found evidence for differences in nonlinear selection across the three environments. Our results suggest that the fitness returns of a given offspring size depend simultaneously on their environmental context, and on the context of other offspring traits. Offspring size effects can be more pervasive with regards to their influence on the fitness returns of other traits than previously recognized, and we suggest that the evolution of offspring size cannot be understood in isolation from other traits. Overall, variability in the form and strength of selection on offspring size in nature may reduce the efficacy of selection on offspring size and maintain variation in this trait.

Previously, the group was assumed to have gone locally extinct in northern Africa shortly after the Eocene Oligocene boundary, with a last record at the similar to 31.5 Ma Taqah locality in Oman. Here we describe a tiny oligopithecid from the youngest (similar to 29.5-30 Ma) primate-bearing horizon in the Jebel Qatrani Formation, based on a partial hemimandible with a largely complete first molar. This is the first record of an oligopithecid in the upper sequence of that Formation, occurring 160 m above the next-youngest oligopithecid-bearing locality (Quarry E), and provides a new last appearance datum for Oligopithecidae. The species is Marchkedly smaller than its older oligopithecid relatives Catopithecus and Oligopithecus, and indeed is one of the smallest anthropoids known, suggesting that it represents a member of a dwarfed lineage. This material adds to the evidence provided by the co-occurring species Afrotarsius chatrathi and Qatrania fleaglei for a fairly diverse, but exceedingly rare, small primate fauna at a horizon that is otherwise dominated by much larger and more derived propliopithecids and parapithecids.

EVODEVO	Phylogeny Evolution Metazoa SSU Ribosomal RNA Maximum likelihood	MOLECULAR-DATA ANIMAL PHYLOGENY	On 12 Februaryruary 1988 (by coincidence Charles Darwin's birthday), a paper published in Science by Katherine Field, Rudy Raff, and colleagues presented the first credible molecular analysis of metazoan phylogeny based on sequences from the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU). Here I examine the main conclusions reached in this manuscript. I reconstitute their dataset and, by recompiling software available in 1988, I consider how they might have achieved a more accurate tree. I show how three common methods to avoid systematic error - more data, careful taxon sampling and superior models of evolution - overcome the errors that exist in the original paper. This approach illustrates the basis of some of the major advances of the past 25 years resulting in our current understanding of animal phylogeny.

Presently, many theoretical analyses of the RQH typically examine fitness interactions in host-parasite frameworks. Less emphasis has been placed on understanding the impact of host ploidy in these systems. In this study, we look to investigate the high observed rates of recombination observed in two common haplodiploid species (Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris). We compared haplodiploid to diploid host populations under infection with haploid asexual parasites, using a matching allele model. Results from a simulation analysis showed that the Red Queen does not run in haplodiploid hosts and is therefore, probably not responsible for the high recombination rates observed so far in haplodiploid hosts.

It is unknown whether or not cry2 underwent adaptive evolution in these insects. In the present study, we cloned and sequenced the full-length cry2 from a fig pollinator species, Ceratosolen solmsi (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea: Agaonidae), and examined the molecular evolution and daily expression of this gene. Our results suggest that cry2 underwent positive selection in the branch leading to hymenopteran insects. The function of CRY2 might have been fixed since undergoing natural selection in the ancestor of Hymenoptera. Male pollinators showed stronger rhythmicity in the host figs, which reflect an adaptation to their life cycles.

Despite the widespread importance of this speciation mechanism, its genetic basis has been explored in only a few groups. Here, we characterize the genetic basis of pollinator-mediated divergence of two species in genus Ipomopsis, I. guttata and I. tenuifolia, using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses of floral traits and other variable phenotypes. We detected one to six QTLs per trait, with each QTL generally explaining small to modest amounts of the phenotypic variance of a backcross hybrid population. In contrast, flowering time and anthocyanin abundance (a metric of color variation) were controlled by a few QTLs of relatively large effect. QTLs were strongly clustered within linkage groups, with 26 of 37 QTLs localized to six Marchker-interval 'hotspots,' all of which harbored pleiotropic QTLs. In contrast to other studies that have examined the genetic basis of pollinator shifts, our results indicate that, in general, mutations of small to modest effect on phenotype were involved. Thus, the evolutionary transition between the distinct pollination modes of I. guttata and I. tenuifolia likely proceeded incrementally, rather than saltationally.

Oddly, the role of functional importance, mainly measured by essentiality, in determining evolutionary rate has been challenged in recent studies. Several variables other than protein essentiality, such as expression level, gene compactness, protein-protein interactions, etc., have been suggested to affect protein evolutionary rate. In the present review, we try to refine the concept of functional importance of a gene, and consider three factors-functional importance, expression level, and gene compactness, as independent determinants of evolutionary rate of a protein, based not only on their known correlation with evolutionary rate but also on a reasonable mechanistic model. We suggest a framework based on these mechanistic models to correctly interpret the correlations between evolutionary rates and the various variables as well as the interrelationships among the variables.

Understanding the relationship between these two types of allometry is crucial to understanding the evolution of allometry and, more generally, the evolution of shape. However, the effects of ontogenetic allometry on static allometry remain largely unexplored. Here, we first show analytically how individual variation in ontogenetic allometry and body size affect static allometry. Using two longitudinal data sets on ontogenetic and static allometry, we then estimate variances and covariances for the different parameters of the ontogenetic allometry defined in our model and assess their relative contribution to the static allometric slope. The mean ontogenetic allometry is the main parameter that determines the static allometric slope, while the covariance between the ontogenetic allometric slope and body size generates most of the discrepancies between ontogenetic and static allometry. These results suggest that the apparent evolutionary stasis of the static allometric slope is not generated by internal (developmental) constraints but more likely results from external constraints imposed by selection.

Bird species restricted to these habitats have patchy distributions, although connectivity may have been influenced by past glacial cycles as a result of the substitution of forest by savanna. Because these landscape changes are a matter of debate in the history of Amazonia, we studied the diversification of Xenopipo atronitens, a white sand specialist, aiming to infer the effects of past climate changes. The split of Xenopipo atronitens from its sister species, Xenopipo uniformis, may be related to Tepuis erosion and retreat of escarpments during the Miocene, or to a dispersal event. Compared with birds from terra firme forest, X.atronitens has low genetic structure. Low levels of unidirectional gene flow were found from the Guyana Shield to adjacent areas. Demographic expansion starting approximately 25 kyr BP was detected for some populations and is probably related to the Last Glacial Maximum and subsequent climate improvement. Landscape genetic analyses indicate that the forested (terra firme) matrix acts as a barrier for the dispersal of X.atronitens. The results of the present study indicate that glacial cycles have deeply influenced Amazonian biogeographical history, demonstrating a complex interaction between forest and nonforest habitats during the Pleistocene.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 60-76.

They are subject to environmental influences, chance appearance and fixation of mutations, and numerous other idiosyncrasies. Genomics is detailing the molecular signature of effects of these mechanisms on phenotypes, but because numerous distinct evolutionary explanations can produce a given genomic pattern, the molecular details, rather than elucidating process, typically distract from explanatory insight and contribute little to predictive capability. While genomic research has burgeoned, direct study of evolutionary and developmental processes has lagged. We advocate for reinvigoration of direct study of process, along with refocusing of attention on questions of broad biological import, as more productive of urgently needed insights, which genomic approaches are not providing.

An example is cross-protection, where physiological adaptation against a present environmental stressor can protect an organism against a future stressor. Another is anticipation, where an organism uses information about its present environment to trigger gene expression and other physiological changes adaptive in future environments. Predictive abilities like this exist in organisms that have been exposed to periodic changes in environments. It is unknown how readily they can evolve. To answer this question, we carried out laboratory evolution experiments in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Specifically, we exposed three replicate populations of yeast to environments that varied cyclically between two stressors, salt stress and oxidative stress, every 10 generations, for a total of 300 generations. We evolved six replicate control populations in only one of these stressors for the same amount of time. We analyzed fitness changes and genome-scale expression changes in all these evolved populations. Our populations evolved asymmetric cross protection, where oxidative stress protects against salt stress but not vice versa. Gene expression data also suggest the evolution of anticipation and basal gene expression changes that occur uniquely in cyclic environments. Our study shows that highly complex physiological states that are adaptive in future environments can evolve on very short evolutionary time scales.

The posterior body of female Osedax penetrates into the bone forming extensions known as 'roots', which host heterotrophic symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes beneath the epidermis. The Osedax root epithelium presumably absorbs bone collagen and/or lipids, which are metabolized by the symbiotic bacteria that in turn serve for Osedax's nutrition. Here, we show that Osedax roots express extremely high amounts of vacuolar-H+-ATPase (VHA), which is located in the apical membrane and in cytoplasmic vesicles of root and ovisac epithelial cells. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA), which catalyses the hydration of CO2 into H+ and HCO3-, is also expressed in roots and throughout Osedax body. These results suggest Osedax roots have massive acid-secreting capacity via VHA, fuelled by H+ derived from the CA-catalysed hydration of CO2 produced by aerobic metabolism. We propose the secreted acid dissolves the bone carbonate matrix to then allow the absorption of bone-derived nutrients across the skin. In an exciting example of convergent evolution, this model for acid secretion is reMarchkably similar to mammalian osteoclast cells. However, while osteoclasts dissolve bone for repairing and remodelling, the Osedax root epithelium secretes acid to dissolve foreign bone to access nutrients.

Given the importance of estrogen in maintaining physiological systems aside from fertility, similar ovarian aging in humans and chimpanzees combined with somatic aging differences indicates an important role for noNovemberarian estrogen. Consistent with this framework, researchers have nominated the adrenal androgen dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DHEAS), which can be peripherally converted to estrogen, as a bioMarchker of aging in humans and other primates. Faster Decemberline in production of this steroid with age in chimpanzees could help explain somatic aging differences. Here, we report circulating levels of DHEAS in captive female chimpanzees and compare them with published levels in women. Instead of faster, the Decemberline is slower in chimpanzees, but from a much lower peak. Levels reported for other great apes are lower still. These results point away from slowed Decemberline but toward increased DHEAS production as one of the mechanisms underlying the evolution of human longevity. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The current literature of these methods centers on three competing hypotheses-stasis, random walk, and directional trend-corresponding to an increasing scaling of variance with time interval (unchanging, for stasis linear, for random walk quadratic, for trend). For applications to a single trait there are powerful methods for discriminating among these hypotheses but for multivariate data sets, especially the very high-dimensional multivariate data arising in image-feature-based and morphometric studies, current statistical approaches appear to be of less help. This paper proves that in the limiting case of high-dimensional morphospaces, the principal component or principal coordinate ordination of every sufficiently lengthy isotropic random walk tends to the same geometrical shape, which is not that of an ellipsoid and for which the principal components or coordinates are not independent even though they are uncorrelated. Specifically, the scatter of PC1 against PC2 is just a parabolic curve. The quantitative characteristics of this specific shape are not described appropriately by the corresponding covariance structure or Gaussian model, and the discrepancy may be pertinent to much of the existing literature of methods for differentiating among those three models of evolutionary multivariate time series. From a close examination of this common geometry of the ideal random walk model as seen in its principal components, I suggest a test for stasis, along with a mixed model illustrated by a reanalysis of some data of Gunz et al., and a related test for directional trend. These comments are intended to apply to all high-dimensional morphospaces, not just those arising in geometric morphometrics. Applications of principal components in this context distort high-dimensional data in ways that have a tendency to mislead but these distortions can be intercepted so that studies of tempo and mode can nevertheless proceed.

SALMON SALMO-SALAR INDUCED EVOLUTION INDUCED SELECTION GENOTYPING ERRORS FISH STOCKS BALTIC SEA FLOW CONSEQUENCES	Over the recent years, growing number of studies suggests that intensive size-selective fishing can cause evolutionary changes in life-history traits in the harvested population, which can have drastic negative effects on populations, ecosystems and fisheries. However, most studies to date have overlooked the potential role of immigration of fish with different phenotypes as an alternative plausible mechanism behind observed phenotypic trends. Here, we investigated the evolutionary consequences of intensive fishing simultaneously at phenotypic and molecular level in Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) population in the Baltic Sea over a 24-year period. We detected Marchked changes in size- and age-distributions and increase in juvenile growth rate. We also observed reduction of age at sexual maturity in males that has frequently been considered to support the hypothesis of fisheries-induced evolution. However, combined individual-based life-history and genetic analyses indicated increased immigration of foreign individuals with different life-history patterns as an alternative mechanism behind the observed phenotypic change. This study demonstrates the value of combining genetic and phenotypic analyses and suggests that replacement or breakdown of locally adapted gene complexes may play important role in impeding the recovery of fish populations.

They not only share strong morphological similarities, such as the presence of a reptant stem but also some cytogenetic characteristics. Several species in section Corniculatae share a base chromosome number x = 5 with species in section Ripariae, while other species in the former have a x = 6. We used a molecular and cytogenetic approach to determine the phylogenetic relationships, test the previous taxonomic classification and study the genome rearrangements that led to the differences in chromosome size and basic chromosome number between both sections. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred based on DNA sequences from chloroplast and nuclear ribosomal ITS. The molecular phylogenetic analyses found that neither of the sections are monophyletic, but do support two clades. The first group contains diploid species with x = 5, large chromosomes and high DNA content and the second diploid and polyploidy species with x = 6, small chromosomes and low DNA content. The x = 5 clade comprises species of both sections, while the x = 6 clade was formed mainly by section Corniculatae species and O. serpens from section Ripariae. Our results suggest that x = 5 and high DNA content are derived conditions, which may have resulted from descendent disploidy and proliferation of transposable elements. Thus, cytogenetic data superimposed on the phylogeny have shown two different modes of chromosome evolution in both lineages: (1) chromosome rearrangements and increase in genome size in the x = 5 lineage and (2) polyploidy playing the main role in chromosome evolution among species in the x = 6 species. A taxonomic revision for the two sections is suggested. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The genes coding for these peptides are tandemly located on the same chromosome. A tandem duplication occurring in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates has been proposed as responsible. In contrast to the two peptide hormones, only one oxytocin receptor (OXTR) but three arginine vasopressin receptors (AVPR1A, AVPR1B, and AVPR2) are known these receptors probably arose from two rounds of genome duplication in the common ancestor of vertebrates. In this study, we addressed the molecular evolution of the OXT-OXTR system in eutherians. Our analyses suggest that an amino acid change from isoleucine to lysine on the eighth site (I8L) of the peptide, which corresponded to a change from mesotocin to OXT, had occurred during the common ancestral lineage of eutherians. At around the same time that the emergence of OXT occurred, functional constraints on the OXT receptor (pre-OXTR) might have relaxed, and a series of nonsynonymous substitutions might have accumulated. Only a few of these nonsynonymous substitutions might have contributed to reestablishing the molecular relationship between the OXT ligand and its receptor, after which functional constraints on the OXTR were reinstated. Since the OXT-OXTR system plays an important role in eutherians, the evolution of the OXT-OXTR system was probably an essential component of the genesis of the eutherian signature.

An exploration of the evolutionary mechanism of this functional transition is made. To identify homologous genes of P34, syntenic network was constructed using syntenic relationships from the Plant Genome Duplication Database. The collected homologous genes, along with SPE31, a highly homologous protein to P34 from the seeds of Pachyrhizus erosus, were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. The results show that multiple gene duplications, exon shuffling and following granulin domain loss and some critical point mutations are associated with the functional transition. Although some tests suggested the existence of positive selection, the possibility that random fixation under relaxation of purifying selection results in the functional transition is also supported. In addition, the genes Glyma08g12340 and Medtr8g086470 may belong to a new group within the papain family.

However, unlike protein-coding regions, paired epistatic interactions have lacked the appropriate statistical tools for the detection of departures from selective neutrality. Here, a model is presented for the analysis of paired epistatic regions that draws upon the population genetics of the compensatory substitution process to detect the relative strength of natural selection acting against deleterious combinations of alleles. The method is based upon the relative rates of double and single substitution, and can differentiate between nonindependent interactions and negatively epistatic ones. The model is implemented in a fully Bayesian framework for parameter estimation and is demonstrated using a 5S rRNA data set. In addition to the detection of selection, modeling the double and single substitution processes in this manner inherently accounts for a substantial proportion of rate variation among stem positions.

Auxin promotes postembryonic root initiation in both groups but from different cell types. In several euphyllophytes, such as Arabidopsis, rice, and maize, AS2/LOB-domain (ASL/LBD) proteins act directly downstream of auxin and are conserved elements necessary for root initiation. It is currently unknown whether similar or different genetic mechanisms act downstream of auxin for root initiation in lycophytes and euphyllophytes. We searched for ASL/LBD proteins in genome sequences spanning the tree of life to retrace their evolutionary history. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of ASL/LBD proteins and mapped the functions of all characterized ASL/LBD onto the phylogenetic trees. We identified a clade specifically associated with root development, which includes no lycophyte sequence. This points toward the existence of distinct genetic mechanisms downstream of auxin for root initiation in lycophytes and euphyllophytes.

However, the mechanistic basis of these clines has not been investigated so far. Here, we investigate the utilization of lipids during starvation as a function of duration of stress in D. ananassae. We found higher lipid content responsible for high starvation resistance at lower latitudes. Lipids were utilized during starvation only not during any other climatic stresses like desiccation or thermal stresses. We also found a cline for consumption of total body lipids as more content (out of total amount of lipids) was utilized by flies at lower latitudes and lesser at higher latitudes. But, there was no latitudinal cline for threshold lipid amount in the case of females while for males there was a positive cline. Lastly, parallel clines have evolved under contrasting climatic conditions i.e. drier and colder northern localities have flies with lower lipid and reduced starvation resistance while hot and humid localities favor flies with higher lipid levels and greater starvation tolerance. Thus, the evolution of clines associated with starvation and lipid content might have resulted due to specific ecological conditions i.e. humidity gradient on the Indian subcontinent.

Lessons from seaweeds (Fucus) in the Baltic Sea	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	biophysical ocean modelling clonality Fucus radicans Fucus vesiculosus long-distance drift parallel divergence		Parallel evolution has been invoked as a forceful mechanism of ecotype and species formation in many animal taxa. However, parallelism may be difficult to Septemberarate from recently monophyletically diverged species that are likely to show complex genetic relationships as a result of considerable shared ancestral variation and secondary hybridization in local areas. Thus, species' degrees of reproductive isolation, barriers to dispersal and, in particular, limited capacities for long-distance dispersal will affect demographical structures underlying mechanisms of divergent evolution. Here, we used nine microsatellite DNA Marchkers to study intra- and interspecific genetic diversity of two recently diverged species of brown macroalgae, Fucus radicans (L. Bergstrom & L. Kautsky) and F.vesiculosus (Linnaeus), in the Baltic Sea. We further performed biophysical modelling to identify likely connectivity patterns influencing the species' genetic structures. For each species, we found intraspecific contrasting patterns of clonality incidence and population structure. In addition, strong genetic differentiation between the two species within each locality supported the existence of two distinct evolutionary lineages (F-ST=0.15-0.41). However, overall genetic clustering analyses across both species' populations revealed that all populations from one region (Estonia) were more genetically similar to each other than to their own taxon from the other two regions (Sweden and Finland). Our data support a hypothesis of parallel speciation. Alternatively, Estonia may be the ancestral source of both species, but is presently isolated by oceanographic barriers to dispersal. Thus, a limited gene flow in combination with genetic drift could have shaped the seemingly parallel structure.

Initially believed to be restricted to plants, paramutation has recently been observed in animal models, and a paramutation-like event has been noted in humans. Despite the accumulating evidence suggesting that trans-acting epigenetic effects can be inherited transgenerationally and therefore generate non-genomic phenotypic variation, these effects have been largely ignored in the context of evolutionary theory. The model presented here incorporates paramutation into the standard model of viability selection at one locus and demonstrates that paramutation can create long-term biological diversity in the absence of genetic change, and even in the absence of the original paramutagenic allele. Therefore, if paramutation is present, attributing evolution to only a traditional genetic model may fail to encompass the broad scope of phenotypic differences observed in nature. Moreover, we show also that an unusual mathematical behaviour, analogous to Ewens' gap of the two-locus two-allele symmetric-selection model, occurs: when the rate of one parameter - for example, the rate of paramutation - is increased, a pair of equilibria may disappear only to reappear as this parameter increases further. In sumMarchy, by incorporating even the simplest epigenetic parameters into the standard population-genetic model of selection, we show how this type of inheritance system can profoundly alter the course of evolution.

The case of Toxoplasma gondii	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	trophic transmission behavioural manipulation vertical transmission adaptive dynamics population genetics approach virulence	EVOLUTIONARY EPIDEMIOLOGY TRANSMISSION BEHAVIOR INFECTION RATS VIRULENCE MODELS POPULATIONS PREDATORS MIGRATION	Parasites with complex life cycles are expected to manipulate the behaviour of their intermediate hosts (IHs), which increase their predation rate and facilitate the transmission to definitive hosts (DHs). This ability, however, is a double-edged sword when the parasite can also be transmitted vertically in the IH. In this situation, as the manipulation of the IH behaviour increases the IH death rate, it conflicts with vertical transmission, which requires healthy and reproducing IHs. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, a widespread pathogen, combines both trophic and vertical transmission strategies. Is parasite manipulation of host behaviour still adaptive in this situation? We model the evolution of the IH manipulation by T. gondii to study the conflict between these two routes of transmission under different epidemiological situations. Model outputs show that manipulation is particularly advantageous for virulent strains and in epidemic situations, and that different levels of manipulation may evolve depending on the sex of the IH and the transmission routes considered. These results may help to understand the variability of strain characteristics encountered for T. gondii and may extend to other trophically transmitted parasites.

Sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal ITS region and the chloroplast trnL intron/trnL-F spacer region were used in this study to determine the systematic position of Parodiodoxa. For this purpose, taxa were sampled both at the tribal and generic levels. Results from tribal-level sampling support the inclusion of Parodiodoxa in the tribe Thelypodieae, whereas those at the generic level reveal a relationship to Weberbauera (W. rosulans and W. herzogii). Topologies within the Thelypodieae were poorly resolved, in agreement with previous studies. Morphological characteristics of Parodiodoxa are also discussed in relation to other genera of the tribe.

An alternate or additional mechanism could be adaptive partner or symbiont choice mediating horizontal cultivar transmission or de Novembero domestication of free-living fungi. Using microsatellite genotyping for the attine ant Mycocepurus smithii and ITS rDNA sequencing for fungal cultivars, we provide the first detailed population genetic analysis of local ant-fungus associations to test for the relative importance of vertical vs. horizontal transmission in a single attine species. M.smithii is the only known asexual attine ant, and it is furthermore exceptional because it cultivates a far greater cultivar diversity than any other attine ant. Cultivar switching could permit the ants to re-acquire cultivars after garden loss, to purge inferior cultivars that are locally mal-adapted or that accumulated deleterious mutations under long-term asexuality. Compared to other attine ants, symbiont choice and local adaptation of ant-fungus combinations may play a more important role than partner-fidelity feedback in the co-evolutionary process of M.smithii and its fungal symbionts.

In a critical review of 17 fossil and living clades of shell-bearing molluscs with photosymbionts (two of them newly inferred), adaptive shell modifications and ecological aspects are discussed in the broader context of photosymbioses in other phyla. Fossil candidates have characteristics that are rare or unknown in living photosymbiotic molluscs, including cementation, porous shell microstructure, and epifaunal habits on carbonate muds. Many ancient photosymbioses may have lived in planktonically more productive environments than are typical of living tropical forms. This may be related to the late appearance (Early Eocene) of the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium, which can thrive under highly oligotrophic conditions. Living photosymbiotic molluscs represent a small and atypical sample of all the photosymbiotic clades that have evolved.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 497-511.

This proximate-ultimate dynamic brings genetic variation in social environments to the forefront of evolutionary theory. However, the extent of this variation remains largely unknown. Here, we use a member of the Enchenopa binotata species complex of treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae) to assess how mate preferences are influenced by genetic variation in the social environment. We used full-sibling split-families as 'treatment' social environments, and reared focal females alongside each treatment family, describing the mate preferences of the focal females. With this method, we detected substantial genetic variation in social influence on mate preferences. The mate preferences of focal females varied according to the treatment families along with which they grew up. We discuss the evolutionary implications of the presence of such genetic variation in social influence on mate preferences, including potential contributions to the maintenance of genetic variation, the promotion of divergence, and the adaptive evolution of social effects on fitness-related traits.

An extreme example is rapid phenotypic differentiation despite genetic similarity. Another extreme is morphological stasis despite substantial genetic divergence. These opposite patterns have been viewed as reflecting opposite properties of the lineages. In this study, phenotypic radiation accompanied by both rapid divergence and long-term conservatism is documented in the inferred molecular phylogeny of the micro land snails Cavernacmella (Assimineidae) on the Ogasawara Islands. The populations of Cavernacmella on the Sekimon limestone outcrop of Hahajima Island showed Marchked divergence in shell morphology. Within this area, one lineage diversified into types with elongated turret shells, conical shells and flat disc-like shells without substantial genetic differentiation. Additionally, a co-occurring species with these types developed a much larger shell size. Moreover, a lineage adapted to live inside caves in this area. In contrast, populations in the other areas exhibited no morphological differences despite high genetic divergence among populations. Accordingly, the phenotypic evolution of Cavernacmella in Ogasawara is characterized by a pattern of long-term stasis and periodic bursts of change. This pattern suggests that even lineages with phenotypic conservatism could shift to an alternative state allowing rapid phenotypic divergence.

In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phylogenetic tree from molecular data for Novemberices. In the example illustrated here, the program MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby eliminating the need to learn several programs, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, KuMarch S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. Mol Biol Evol. 28:2731-2739). The first step, identification of a set of homologous sequences and downloading those sequences, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those sequences, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phylogenetic tree from the aligned sequences, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible interface for the final step, actually drawing the tree for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a Novemberice to start with a sequence of interest and to build a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that sequence. MEGA is available for use on PCs and Macs from www.megasoftware.net.

Representatives of all clades and grades were considered, spanning the entire stratigraphical range of temnospondyls from the Early Carboniferous through to the Early Cretaceous. Several major groups are defined phylogenetically (node or branch-based) rather than by apomorphies. The following groups were unequivocally found to be monophyletic: Edopoidea (node), Dvinosauria (stem, excl. Brachyopidae), Dissorophoidea (node), Eryopidae (stem), and Stereospondyli (node). The latter encompass three well-defined, branch-based taxa: Rhinesuchidae, Trematosauria and Capitosauria. Trematosauria (stem) contain Trematosauroidea (node), which includes the classic trematosaurids, metoposaurids, and possibly part of the rhytidosteids (Peltostega) but their in-group relationships remain unsettled most other short-snouted stereospondyls (chigutisaurids, brachyopids, Laidleria and the plagiosaurids) are probably monophyletic and likely nest in some form with trematosauroids. Capitosauria (stem) include the Capitosauroidea (node) spanned by Parotosuchus and Mastodonsaurus, with the successive stem taxa Edingerella, Benthosuchus, Wetlugasaurus and Watsonisuchus. In all variant analyses, edopoids form the basalmost temnospondyl clade, followed by a potential clade (or grade) of small terrestrial taxa containing Balanerpeton and Dendrerpeton (Dendrerpetontidae'). All taxa higher than Edopoidea are suggested to form the monophyletic stem taxon Eutemnospondyli, tax. November. The remainder of Temnospondyli fall into four robust and undisputed clades: (1) Dvinosauria (2) Zatracheidae plus Dissorophoidea (3) Eryopidae and (4) Stereospondyli. These taxa are together referred to as Rhachitomi (node). Eryopidae and Stereospondylomorpha are probably monophyletic, here referred to as Eryopiformes (tax. November.). The position of Dissorophoidea + Zatracheidae is still ambiguous it may either form the sister taxon of Dvinosauria, or nest between Dvinosauria and Eryopiformes, whereas there is no support for Euskelia (Dissorophoidea + Eryopidae) after basal taxa of each clade are better understood.

Inferring the evolution of complex social behaviour	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	birds character evolution parental care parental investment phylogenetic comparative methods sex role	EXTRA-PAIR PATERNITY IN-HOUSE SPARROWS PARENTAL CARE QUANTITATIVE GENETICS SEXUAL SELECTION BIPARENTAL CARE BIRDS CONFLICT DIVERSIFICATION POPULATIONS	Phylogenetic comparative analyses of complex traits often reduce the traits of interests into a single (or a few) component variables. Here, we show that this may be an over-simplification, because components of a complex trait may evolve independently from each other. Using eight components of parental care in 400 bird species from 89 avian families that represent the relative contribution of male vs. female to a particular type of care, we show that some components evolve in a highly correlated manner, whereas others exhibit low (or no) phylogenetic correlation. Correlations were stronger within types of parental activity (brooding, feeding, guarding) than within stages of the breeding cycle (incubation, prefledging care, post-fledging care). A phylogenetically corrected cluster analysis identified two groups of parental care components that evolved in a correlated fashion: one group included incubation and brooding, whereas the other group comprised of the remaining components. The two groups of components provide working hypotheses for follow-up studies to test the underlying genetic, developmental and ecological co-evolutionary mechanism between male and female care. Furthermore, the components within each group are expected to respond consistently to different ambient and social environments.

The evolutionary modes commonly included in PCMs are Brownian motion (genetic drift) and the OrnsteinUhlenbeck process (stabilizing selection), whose likelihood functions are mathematically tractable. More complicated models of evolutionary modes, such as branch-specific directional selection, have not been used because calculations of likelihood and parameter estimates in the maximum-likelihood framework are not straightforward. To solve this problem, we introduced a population genetics framework into a PCM, and here, we present a flexible and comprehensive framework for estimating evolutionary parameters through simulation-based likelihood computations. The method does not require analytic likelihood computations, and evolutionary models can be used as long as simulation is possible. Our approach has many advantages: it incorporates different evolutionary modes for phenotypes into phylogeny, it takes intraspecific variation into account, it evaluates full likelihood instead of using sumMarchy statistics, and it can be used to estimate ancestral traits. We present a successful application of the method to the evolution of brain size in primates. Our method can be easily implemented in more computationally effective frameworks such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), which will enhance the use of computationally intensive methods in the study of phenotypic evolution.

The topology of several taxa remains contradictory, and requires further investigations with a larger taxon sampling and additional molecular Marchkers.

The first robust phylogenetic hypothesis for the horse fly tribe Scionini is provided, completing the systematic placement of all tribes in the subfamily Pangoniinae. The Scionini consists of seven mostly southern hemisphere genera distributed in Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand and South America. A 5757 bp alignment of 6 genes, including mitochondrial (COI and COW, ribosomal (28S) and nuclear (AATS and CAD regions 1, 3 and 4) genes, was analysed for 176 taxa using both Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. Results indicate the Scionini are strongly monophyletic, with the exclusion of the only northern hemisphere genus Goniops. The South American genera Fidena, Pityocera and Scione were strongly monophyletic, corresponding to current morphology-based classification schemes. The most widespread genus Scaptia was paraphyletic and formed nine strongly supported monophyletic clades, each corresponding to either the current subgenera or several previously synonymised genera that should be formally resurrected. Molecular results also reveal a newly recognised genus endemic to New Zealand, formerly placed within Scaptia. Divergence time estimation was employed to assess the global biogeographical patterns in the Pangoniinae. These analyses demonstrated that the Scionini are a typical Gondwanan group whose diversification was influenced by the fragmentation of that ancient land mass. Furthermore, results indicate that the Scionini most likely originated in Australia and subsequently radiated to New Zealand and South American by both long distance dispersal and vicariance. The phylogenetic framework of the Scionini provided herein will be valuable for taxonomic revisions of the Tabanidae. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We show that for avian evolutionary relationships, improved taxon sampling, longer sequences and additional data sets are giving stability to the prediction of the grouping of pelecaniforms and ciconiiforms, thus allowing inferences to be made about long-term niche occupancy. Here we report the phylogeny of the pelecaniform birds and their water-carnivore allies using complete mitochondrial genomes, and show that the basic groupings agree with nuclear sequence phylogenies, even though many short branches are not yet fully resolved. In detail, we show that the Pelecaniformes (minus the tropicbird) and the Ciconiiformes (storks, herons and ibises) form a natural group within a seabird water-carnivore clade. We find pelicans are the closest relatives of the shoebill (in a clade with the hammerkop), and we confirm that tropicbirds are not pelecaniforms. In general, the group appears to be an adaptive radiation into an 'aquatic carnivore' niche that it has occupied for 60-70 million years. From an ecological and life history perspective, the combined pelecaniform-ciconiform group is more informative than focusing on differences in morphology. These findings allow a start to integrating molecular evolution and macroecology. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

All phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that specimens from Tam Dao are nested in Kurixalus bisacculus, indicating that they belong to K. bisacculus. R. appendiculatus is closer to genus Kurixalus than to other genera with strong support values. In combination with morphological evidence, it is suggested that R. appendiculatus should be placed in Kurixalus. Kurixalus verrucosus is not related to Kurixalus appendiculatus and it is the sister taxon to the clade of K. bisacculus and Kurixalus odontotarsus, which rejects that K. verrucosus is a synonym of K. appendiculatus. The genus Kurixalus needs redefinition by clear synapomorphic characters, and generic status of Kurixalus ananjevae deserves further examination. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

STR HYBRIDIZATION PLANTS EVOLUTION	Phylogeny reconstruction based on multiple unlinked Marchkers is often hampered by incongruent gene trees, especially in closely related species complexes with high degrees of hybridization and polyploidy. To investigate the particular strengths and limitations of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), low-copy nuclear and multicopy nuclear Marchkers for elucidating the evolutionary history of such groups, we focus on Hieracium s.str., a predominantly apomictic genus combining the above-mentioned features. Sequences of the trnV-ndhC and trnT-trnL intergenic spacers were combined for phylogenetic analyses of cpDNA. Part of the highly variable gene for squalene synthase (sqs) was applied as a low-copy nuclear Marchker. Both gene trees were compared with previous results based on the multicopy external transcribed spacer (ETS) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. The power of the different Marchkers to detect hybridization varied, but they largely agreed on particular hybrid and allopolyploid origins. The same crown groups of species were recognizable in each dataset, but basal relationships were strongly incongruent among cpDNA, sqs and ETS trees. The ETS tree was considered as the best approximation of the species tree. Both cpDNA and sqs trees showed basal polytomies as well as merging or splitting of species groups of non-hybrid taxa. These patterns can be best explained by a rapid diversification of the genus with ancestral polymorphism and incomplete lineage sorting. A hypothetical scenario of Hieracium speciation based on all available (including non-molecular) evidence is depicted. Incorporation of seemingly contradictory information helped to better understand species origins and evolutionary patterns in this notoriously difficult agamic complex.

To evaluate the hypothesis that monoterpene diversity is related to functional diversification after gene duplication, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of monoterpene synthases (TPSb) - the genes underlying monoterpene synthesis - in Protium, a taxonomically and chemically diverse genus of tropical trees. We isolated multiple copies of TPSb genes from chemically divergent Protium species, reconstructed the phylogeny of this gene family, used maximum-likelihood estimation of selection coefficients, and inferred residues evolving under positive selection. We found evidence for one ancient and multiple more recent duplication events giving rise to three, and potentially five, copies of TPSb genes currently present in Protium. There was evidence for adaptive evolution in one copy with a positively selected residue likely involved in protein folding and product specificity. All other copies were inferred to be evolving under a combination of stabilizing and/or relaxed selection. Although gene copy number is consistent with the extensive phenotypic diversity in monoterpenes shown in Protium, selection analyses suggest that not all copies are undergoing divergent selection consistent with a coevolutionary arms race with enemies, but instead may be under stabilizing and relaxed selection consistent with signaling or physiological stress functionality.

This variability in sex expression can be found within species and has been found to be influenced by external factors such as resource levels. The sexual strategy selected will depend not only on the number of pollen grains and seeds an individual can produce but also on the chance of success of this production. Production depends on trade-offs between female and male functions of hermaphrodites according to resource level and subsequent fate is influenced by selfing, inbreeding depression and competition among offspring. The goal of this study is to determine how interactions between these key parameters, resources availability, selfing and density-dependent competition within offspring influence the evolution of reproductive systems. We showed with a theoretical approach that (i) a change in resource level at the population level affects sexual strategies only in certain conditions (ii) density-dependent seedling mortality disadvantages females compared to hermaphrodites and interacts strongly with resource level.

The question of why such genes are frequently mobile has received increasing attention. Here, we use an explicit population genetic approach to model the evolution of plasmid-borne bacterial public goods production. Our findings highlight the importance of both transmission and relatedness as factors driving the evolution of plasmid-borne public goods production. We partition the effects of plasmid transfer of social traits into those of infectivity and the effect of increased relatedness. Our results demonstrate that, owing to its effect on relatedness, plasmid mobility increases the invasion and stability of public goods, in a way not seen in individually beneficial traits. In addition, we show that plasmid transfer increases relatedness when public goods production is rare but this effect Decemberlines when production is common, with both scenarios leading to an increase in the frequency of plasmid-borne public goods. Plasmids remain important vectors for the spread of social genes involved in bacterial virulence thus an understanding of their dynamics is highly relevant from a public health perspective.

The effects of glacial events have left a genomic signature, resulting in concordant phylogeographical structures among many species. To investigate the effects of Quaternary climatic changes on the evolution in H. otakii, fragments of 471 bp at the 5' end of mitochondria! DNA control region were sequenced for 275 individuals from 10 localities in the Northern China and Japan. Both mismatch distribution analyses and neutrality tests suggested recent population expansion (64,000-227,000 years ago). Although estimated value of pairwise population differentiation (F-ST) was low, half (23 of 45) of the comparisons showed statistically significant. Coalescent-based estimates show that gene flow was asymmetric or directional, most of all comparisons (57 of 65) among populations showed low evaluation value of N-m (N-m < 10). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed genetic structuring among groups when the data was partitioned into six groups in this study. The defined pattern of genetic variation suggested a crucial role of habitat requirement, Marchine current, Marchine gyres and history process. Absence of genetic structure over hundreds of kilometers between AO and assemblage of QD, RZ and GY might imply the common coalescent other than current gene flow. Specific exchange mechanism and fine scale genetic structure need further research using faster evolution molecular Marchkers (microsatellite Marchkers) and further sampling. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditionally, such differences were qualitatively related to increased folivory in crouzeliines. This was subsequently disproved by microwear and shearing crest analyses, indicating that all pliopithecids were soft-fruit eaters, except for the more folivorous crouzeliine Barberapithecus. This seems however at odds with the occlusal morphology of the latter, intermediate between those of Pliopithecus and the more derived crouzeliine Anapithecus. To further assess dietary evolution in this group, we report results of dental microwear for two Iberian pliopithecids: Pliopithecus canmatensis, from several Abocador de Can Mata localities (11.8-11.7 Ma, MN8), and Barberapithecus huerzeleri from Castell de Barbera (ca. 11.2-10.5 Ma, MN8, or MN9). Contrary to previously published results, our analyses suggest that all pliopithecids, including Barberapithecus, had a frugivorous diet with a significant sclerocarpic component-apparently more Marchked in some pliopithecines (such as P. canmatensis) than in the crouzeliine Anapithecus. If our interpretation is correct, it would mean that, within the framework of a frugivorous diet with some hard-object feeding, crouzeliine dental evolution would have been driven by selection pressures towards increased soft-fruit consumption instead of folivory. Dental differences between pliopithecids and hominoids with a significant sclerocarpic component (i.e., orangutans) might be related to phylogenetic constraints, different food-processing methods and/or fracture toughness of hard foods consumed. Although additional research would be required, results suggest that dietary niche partitioning played a significant role in the radiation of European pliopithecids. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It has often been assumed theoretically that aside from dominance, selective parameters do not differ between cells of varying ploidy. Using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, I compared the effect size of 20 adaptive mutations in haploids and homozygous diploids and found, surprisingly, that the same mutations often had a much larger effect in haploids than homozygous diploids. This empirical result demonstrates that it cannot be assumed that mutations will have the same effect in haploids and homozygous diploids.

We present the results of a dated molecular phylogeny and a survey of morphology, micromorphology and stem anatomy revealing the phylogenetic relationships and historical biogeography of the subfamily as well as its morphological evolution. The results are converted into a new classification of the group. The divergence of Polycnemoideae from AMarchanthaceae s.str. dates back to the Eocene and the oldest split in the subfamily Septemberarated a Northern Hemisphere lineage (Polycnemum) and a predominantly Southern Hemisphere lineage (Nitrophila, Hemichroa, Surreya gen. November.) around the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. There is some evidence for a southern connection via Antarctica in the ancestor of the Nitrophila/Hemichroa/Surreya clade. The amphitropical genus Nitrophila likely originated in South America and reached North America via long-distance dispersal. Genera of Polycnemoideae diversified during the Miocene and Pliocene. They are species-poor and appear relictual. The morphological and micromorphological survey revealed a number of useful diagnostic characters which permit a clear definition of all four genera and 13 species recognized here. Hemichroa in its traditional circumscription lacks diagnostic characters. Hemichroa pentandra is much more similar to Nitrophila and shares a number of symplesiomorphies with it, while H. diandra and H. mesembryanthema, which form a highly supported clade, show several clear synapomorphic characters. Therefore the latter two species are here described within a new genus, Surreya R. Masson & G. Kadereit.

Over the past Decemberade it has become increasingly clear that there is a continuum between disomic and multisomic inheritance, with the rate of tetrasomy differing among species and among chromosomes within species. Here, we use a simple population genetic model to study the impact of the mode of inheritance on the genetic diversity and population divergence of tetraploids. We found that under almost strict disomic inheritance the tetraploid genome is divided into two Septemberarate subgenomes, such as found in classical allopolyploids. In those cases, assuming full tetrasomy in the analysis of polyploid genetic data will lead to an important bias in estimates of genetic diversity and population divergence. However, we found that even a low rate of allele exchange between the two subgenomes, at about one event per generation, is sufficient to homogenise the allele frequencies over the subgenomes, and the estimates become essentially unbiased. The inbreeding coefficient FIS can then be used to detect whether the estimates of diversity and divergence will be biased when full multisomy is assumed. Finally, we found that different sumMarchy statistics for measuring the strength of population differentiation are differentially affected by a deviation from full tetrasomy. Our model results provide several useful guidelines for the analysis of polyploid data, helping researchers to determine when their inferences are biased and which sumMarchy statistics to use.

Polyploidy is found in many plants and some animal species and today we know that polyploidy has had a role in the evolution of all angiosperms. Despite its widespread occurrence, the direct effect of polyploidy on evolutionary success of a species is still largely unknown. Over the years many attractive hypotheses have been proposed in an attempt to assign functionality to the increased content of a duplicated genome. Among these hypotheses are the proposal that genome doubling confers distinct advantages to a polyploid and that these advantages allow polyploids to thrive in environments that pose challenges to the polyploid's diploid progenitors. This article revisits these long-standing questions and explores how the integration of recent genomic developments with ecological, physiological and evolutionary perspectives has contributed to addressing unresolved problems about the role of polyploidy. Although unsatisfactory, the current conclusion has to be that despite significant progress, there still isn't enough information to unequivocally answer many unresolved questions about cause and effect of polyploidy on evolutionary success of a species. There is, however, reason to believe that the increasingly integrative approaches discussed here should allow us in the future to make more direct connections between the effects of polyploidy on the genome and the responses this condition elicits from the organism living in its natural environment.

We used PCR assays that target the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of Bd to determine the prevalence and genetic diversity of Bd in South Korea, where Bd is widely distributed but is not known to cause morbidity or mortality in wild populations. We isolated Korean Bd strains from native amphibians with low infection loads and compared them to known worldwide Bd strains using 19 polymorphic SNP and microsatellite loci. Bd prevalence ranged between 12.5 and 48.0%, in 11 of 17 native Korean species, and 24.7% in the introduced bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus. Based on ITS sequence variation, 47 of the 50 identified Korean haplotypes formed a group closely associated with a native Brazilian Bd lineage, Septemberarated from the Bd-GPL lineage. However, multilocus genotyping of three Korean Bd isolates revealed strong divergence from both Bd-GPL and the native Brazilian Bd lineages. Thus, the ITS region resolves genotypes that diverge from Bd-GPL but otherwise generates ambiguous phylogenies. Our results point to the presence of highly diversified endemic strains of Bd across Asian amphibian species. The rarity of Bd-GPL-associated haplotypes suggests that either this lineage was introduced into Korea only recently or Bd-GPL has been outcompeted by native Bd strains. Our results highlight the need to consider possible complex interactions among native Bd lineages, Bd-GPL and their associated amphibian hosts when assessing the spread and impact of Bd-GPL on worldwide amphibian populations.

The dynamics of adaptation depend on the fitness landscape and possibly on the genetic background on which new mutations arise. Here, we model the dynamics of adaptive evolution at the phenotypic and genotypic levels, focusing on a Fisherian landscape characterized by a single peak. We find that Fisher's geometrical model of adaptation, extended to allow for small random environmental variations, is able to explain several features made recently in experimentally evolved populations. Consistent with data on populations evolving under controlled conditions, the model predicts that mean population fitness increases rapidly when populations face Novemberel environments and then achieves a dynamic plateau, the rate of molecular evolution is reMarchkably constant over long periods of evolution, mutators are expected to invade and patterns of epistasis vary along the adaptive walk. Negative epistasis is expected in the initial steps of adaptation but not at later steps, a prediction that remains to be tested. Furthermore, populations are expected to exhibit high levels of phenotypic diversity at all times during their evolution. This implies that populations are possibly able to adapt rapidly to Novemberel abiotic environments.

We tested the hypothesis that parasitoids with different strategies select for alternative host defense characteristics and in doing so contribute to the maintenance of fitness variation and produce trade-offs among traits. We characterized defense traits of Drosophila when exposed to parasitoids with different host searching behaviors (Aphaereta sp. and Leptopilina boulardi). We used host larvae with different natural alleles of the gene Dopa Decemberarboxylase (Ddc), a gene controlling the production of dopamine and known to influence the immune response against parasitoids. Previous population genetic analyses indicate that our focal alleles are maintained by balancing selection. Genotypes exhibited a trade-off between the immune response against Aphaereta sp. and the ability to avoid parasitism by L. boulardi. We also identified a trade-off between the ability to avoid parasitism by L. boulardi and larval competitive ability as indicated by differences in foraging and feeding behavior. Genotypes differed in dopamine levels potentially explaining variation in these traits. Our results highlight the potential role of parasitoid biodiversity on host fitness variation and implicate Ddc as an antagonistic pleiotropic locus influencing larval fitness traits.

Increasingly elaborate codon models are used in a likelihood framework for this estimation. Although there is widespread concern about the robustness of the estimation of the omega ratio, more efforts are needed to estimate this robustness, especially in the context of complex models. Here, we focused on the branch-site codon model. We investigated its robustness on a large set of simulated data. First, we investigated the impact of sequence divergence. We found evidence of underestimation of the synonymous substitution rate for values as small as 0.5, with a slight increase in false positives for the branch-site test. When dS increases further, underestimation of dS is worse, but false positives Decemberrease. Interestingly, the detection of true positives follows a similar distribution, with a maximum for intermediary values of dS. Thus, high dS is more of a concern for a loss of power (false negatives) than for false positives of the test. Second, we investigated the impact of GC content. We showed that there is no significant difference of false positives between high GC (up to similar to 80%) and low GC (similar to 30%) genes. Moreover, neither shifts of GC content on a specific branch nor major shifts in GC along the gene sequence generate many false positives. Our results confirm that the branch-site is a very conservative test.

In fish, the degree of lateralization varies between high- and low-predation populations. While lateralization appears to be widespread in invertebrates, we do not know whether heredity and early experience interact during development as in vertebrates. Here we show, for the first time, that an exposure to predator odour prior to hatching modulates visual lateralization in newly hatched cuttlefish. Only cuttlefish that have been exposed to predator odour display a left-turning bias when tested with blank seawater in a T-shaped apparatus. Exposure to predator odour all the incubation long could appear as an acute predictor of a high-predation surrounding environment. In addition, cuttlefish of all groups display a left-turning preference when tested with predator odour in the apparatus. This suggests the ability of cuttlefish to innately recognize predator odour. To our knowledge, this is the first clear demonstration that lateralization is vulnerable to ecological challenges encountered during embryonic life, and that environmental stimulation of the embryo through the olfactory system could influence the development of subsequent visual lateralization.

Here, we report the first case where this pattern is reversed. The modern (sub)tropical species plexus Globigerinoides sacculifer is characterized by large morphological variability, which has led to the proliferation of taxonomic names attributed to morphological end-members within the plexus. In order to clarify the taxonomic status of its morphotypes and to investigate the genetic connectivity among its currently partly disJunect (sub)tropical populations, we carried out a global survey of two ribosomal RNA regions (SSU and ITS-1) in all recent morphotypes of the plexus collected throughout (sub)tropical surface waters of the global ocean. Unexpectedly, we find an extremely reduced genetic variation within the plexus and no correlation between genetic and morphological divergence, suggesting taxonomical overinterpretation. The genetic homogeneity within the morphospecies is unexpected, considering its partly disJunect range in the (sub)tropical Atlantic and Indo-Pacific and its old age (early Miocene). A sequence variant in the rapidly evolving ITS-1 region indicates the existence of an exclusively Atlantic haplotype, which suggests an episode of relatively recent (last glacial) isolation, followed by subsequent resumption of unidirectional gene flow from the Indo-Pacific into the Atlantic. This is the first example in planktonic foraminifera where the morphological variability in a morphospecies exceeds its rDNA genetic variability. Such evidence for inconsistent scaling of morphological and genetic diversity in planktonic foraminifera could complicate the interpretation of evolutionary patterns in their fossil record.

However, studies using endocasts or the cranium itself are limited to investigating external surface features and the overall size and shape of the brain. A complementary approach uses comparative primate data to estimate the size of internal brain areas. Previous attempts to do this have generally assumed that identical total brain volumes imply identical internal organization. Here, we argue that, in the case of Neanderthals and AMHs, differences in the size of the body and visual system imply differences in organization between the same-sized brains of these two taxa. We show that Neanderthals had significantly larger visual systems than contemporary AMHs (indexed by orbital volume) and that when this, along with their greater body mass, is taken into account, Neanderthals have significantly smaller adjusted endocranial capacities than contemporary AMHs. We discuss possible implications of differing brain organization in terms of social cognition, and consider these in the context of differing abilities to cope with fluctuating resources and cultural maintenance.

Commonly, one assumes that the substitution model is homogeneous across sites within large partitions of the alignment, assigns these partitions a priori, and then fixes their underlying substitution model to the best-fitting model from a hierarchy of named models. Here, we introduce an automatic model selection and model averaging approach within a Bayesian framework that simultaneously estimates the number of partitions, the assignment of sites to partitions, the substitution model for each partition, and the uncertainty in these selections. This new approach is implemented as an add-on to the BEAST 2 software platform. We find that this approach dramatically improves the fit of the nucleotide substitution model compared with existing approaches, and we show, using a number of example data sets, that as many as nine partitions are required to explain the heterogeneity in nucleotide substitution process across sites in a single gene analysis. In some instances, this improved modeling of the substitution process can have a measurable effect on downstream inference, including the estimated phylogeny, relative divergence times, and effective population size histories.

Formal models assume prosocial reputations correlate with the number of cooperative acts one performs however, if reputations flow through information networks, then the number of individuals one assists may be a better proxy. Formal models demonstrate indirect experience must track behaviour with the same fidelity as direct experience for reputations to become viable however, research on corporate reputations suggests performance change does not always affect reputation change. Debate exists over the cognitive mechanisms employed for assessing reputation dynamics. Image scoring suggests reputations fluctuate relative to the number of times one fails to assist others in need, while standing strategy claims reputations fluctuate relative to the number of times one fails to assist others in good standing. This study examines the behavioural correlates of prosocial reputations and their dynamics over a 20-month period in an Afro-Caribbean village. Analyses suggest prosocial reputations: (i) are correlated with the number of individuals one assists in economic production, not the number of cooperative acts (ii) track cooperative behaviour, but are anchored across time and (iii) are captured neither by image scoring nor standing strategy-type mechanisms.

However, the design principles of PDAs remain largely uninvestigated. In this study, we constructed networks to connect domain architectures that had grown out from the same single domain for every single domain in the Pfam-A database and found that there are three main distinctive types of these networks, which suggests that evolution can exploit PDAs in three different ways. Further analysis showed that these three different types of PDA networks are each adopted by different types of protein domains, although many networks exhibit the characteristics of more than one of the three types. Our results shed light on nature's blueprint for protein architecture and provide a framework for understanding architectural design from a network perspective.

Crocodylomorpha, including living crocodilians and their extinct relatives, is the only group of pseudosuchians that survived into the Jurassic. We reassess changes in pseudosuchian morphological diversity (disparity) across this time interval, using considerably larger sample sizes than in previous analyses. Our results show that metrics of pseudosuchian disparity did not change significantly across the TJ boundary, contrasting with previous work suggesting low pseudosuchian disparity in the Early Jurassic following the TJ mass extinction. However, a significant shift in morphospace occupation between Late Triassic and Early Jurassic taxa is recognized, suggesting that the TJ extinction of many pseudosuchian lineages was followed by a major and geologically rapid adaptive radiation of crocodylomorphs. This Marchks the onset of the spectacularly successful evolutionary history of crocodylomorphs in Jurassic and Cretaceous ecosystems.

For this purpose, comparative studies are necessary, which need to take into account the phylogenetic structure of interspecific data. This study applies several of the standard tools of geometric morphometrics, which mostly have been used in intraspecific studies, in the new context of analyzing integration and modularity based on comparative data. Morphometric methods such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, partial least squares, and modularity tests can be applied to phylogenetically independent contrasts of shape data. We illustrate this approach in an analysis of cranial evolution in 160 species from all orders of birds. Mapping the shape information onto the phylogeny indicates that there is a significant phylogenetic signal in skull shape. Multivariate regression of independent contrasts of shape on independent contrasts of size reveals clear evolutionary allometry. Regardless of whether or not a correction for allometry is used, evolutionary integration between the face and braincase is strong, and tests reject the hypothesis that the face and braincase are Septemberarate evolutionary modules. These analyses can easily be applied to other taxa and can be combined with other morphometric tools to address a wide range of questions about evolutionary patterns and processes.

Here, we studied a captive population of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) in which selection lines for male courtship rate have been established. We measure BMR in these lines to see whether selection on male sexual activity would change BMR as a potentially correlated trait. We find that the genetic correlation between courtship rate and BMR is practically zero, indicating that the two traits can evolve independently of each other. Interestingly, we find that the heritability of BMR in our population (h(2) = 0.45) is Marchkedly higher than was previously reported for a captive zebra finch population from Norway. A comparison of the two studies shows that additive genetic variance in BMR has been largely depleted in the Norwegian population, especially the genetic variance in BMR that is independent of body mass. In our population, the slope of BMR increase with body mass differs not only between the sexes but also between the six selection lines, which we tentatively attribute to genetic drift and/or founder effects being strong in small populations. Our study therefore highlights two things. First, the evolvability of BMR may be less constrained by genetic correlations and lack of independent genetic variation than previously described. Second, genetic drift in small populations can rapidly lead to different evolvabilities across populations.

Identifying queen pheromones in multiple species would give new insight into the selective pressures and evolutionary constraints acting on these ubiquitous signals. Here, we present experimental and comparative evidence that 3-methylalkanes, hydrocarbons present on the queen's cuticle, are a queen pheromone throughout the ant genus Lasius. Interspecific variation in the chemical profile is consistent with 3-methylalkanes evolving more slowly than other types of hydrocarbons, perhaps due to differential selection or evolutionary constraints. We argue that the sensory ecology of the worker response imposes strong stabilizing selection on queen pheromones relative to other hydrocarbons. 3-Methylalkanes are also strongly physiologically and genetically coupled with fecundity in at least one Lasius species, which may translate into evolutionary constraints. Our results highlight how honest signalling could minimize evolutionary conflict over reproduction, promoting the evolution and maintenance of eusociality.

Background: Divergent evolutionary lineages of several post-glacial fish species including the threespine stickleback are found together in Ireland. Goals: To investigate the morphological diversity of stickleback populations in Ireland and assess whether morphology evolved in parallel between evolutionary lineages. Methods: We sampled stickleback from lake, river, and coastal habitats across Ireland. Microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA data revealed evolutionary history. Geometric morphometrics and linear trait measurements characterized morphology. We used a multivariate approach to quantify parallel and non-parallel divergence within and between lineages. Results: Repeated evolution of similar morphologies in similar habitats occurred across Ireland, concordant with patterns observed elsewhere in the stickleback distribution. A strong pattern of habitat-specific morphology existed even among divergent lineages. Furthermore, a strong signal of shared morphological divergence occurred along a Marchine freshwater axis. Evidently, deterministic natural selection played a more important role in driving freshwater adaptation than independent evolutionary history.

Can an organism's environment elicit fitness trade-offs between armour development and somatic growth? Background: Wallace Lake, located in south-central Alaska, contains a population of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) exhibiting a bimodal distribution of pelvic phenotypes with modes at both highly reduced and fully developed pelvic armour. The lake has low ion availability, abundant macroinvertebrate predators, and introduced piscivorous fish. Methods: Analyse temporal variability of the bimodal frequency distribution of pelvic phenotypes, direction and degree of asymmetry in bilateral armour traits, and whether extent of pelvic girdle development is inversely related to body size. Conclusions: Distributions of pelvic phenotypes and of individuals with asymmetrical pelvic girdles persist over a 20-year time span. Individuals with greater pelvic expression exhibit more symmetrical anterior processes and ascending branches than those with pelvic reduction. Both directional and fluctuating asymmetry are present in armour traits. Stickleback with complete pelvic structures do not appear to experience reduced somatic growth compared with those with reduced pelvic girdles.

STREAM STICKLEBACK COOK INLET BODY SHAPE ANCESTRAL PLASTICITY GENETIC-DIVERGENCE ADAPTIVE RADIATION EXTINCTION RISK EVOLUTION LAKE	Questions: Do threespine stickleback populations that exhibit pelvic reduction exist at lower densities than populations expressing the full pelvic girdle? Does population size fluctuate more in pelvic-reduced populations? Does trout stocking contribute to fluctuations, if they are present? Organisms: Twenty-three populations of lake-dwelling freshwater threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Populations are of three types: 12 full-pelvic populations, all but two with predatory rainbow trout five pelvic-reduced populations lacking trout and six pelvic-reduced populations originally lacking trout, but into which trout are now stocked. Time and place: Annual field collections within the Cook Inlet region of Alaska, 1993-2010. Analytical methods: Nested ANovemberAs (lake nested within population type) of logCPUE (catch-per-unit-effort), pooling all samples from each lake category in each year. ANovemberA on coefficient of variation (CV) across populations and types. ANovemberAs followed by planned comparisons. Results: Pelvic-reduced populations of both types exist at about one-third the density of full-pelvic populations. However, the coefficient of variations did not differ significantly. No effect of trout stocking was evident. Conclusions: Although catch-per-unit-effort values are only relative rather than absolute population size estimates, if our values of CPUE are comparable across populations, then populations that have evolved pelvic reduction have lower population densities than do full-pelvic populations. The small size of lakes supporting these unique populations and their lower fish density suggest that this rare type of stickleback population may be at elevated risk of extinction.

How much morphological variability is functional given the common potential for stochastic founder effects when new habitats are colonized? Organism and sites: Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from 56 isolated watersheds with Septemberarate Marchine ancestry encompassing 102 freshwater localities ranging from large oligotrophic mountain lakes to darkly stained bog lakes and ponds on the Haida Gwaii archipelago, western Canada. Field data: Biophysical attributes of the habitat (lake volume, depth, percent light transmission at 400 nm, calcium availability, pH, distance to Marchine waters, predation regime including puncturing, compression, and grappling species), morphological traits of the fish (body size, body depth, lateral plate number and position, dorsal spine length, pelvic girdle size, ascending process height, cross-sectional diameter, basal and lateral plate structural overlap), and geographical distance between localities. Based on previous surveys in this archipelago, we predicted the greatest expression of post-capture defences in lakes with high water clarity and the greatest reduction in small stained ponds, as this characterizes regular shifts in the predation landscape. Analyses: Principal components, univariate linear models, and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) analyses. Results: Populations range from 30 to 90 mm in adult male standard length, from full-plated to naked, and from full-spined to un-spined. Again and again, populations converge towards functional multivariate or univariate phenotypes predicted by the biophysical attributes of each habitat, priMarchily lake volume, aquatic spectra, and predation regime. Across a broad diversity of lake volumes, body size is larger in stained lakes and we hypothesize that this is a defence adaptation for increased burst velocity and rapid access to the aphotic zones near the water surface. Defence armour is well developed in clear lakes, independent of lake volume, and in large stained lakes. Completely plated populations are only found in clear habitats. Reduction in posterior plates is associated with accentuated armour development in the anterior trunk in large lakes where predatory vertebrates are common. Anterior armour, including lateral plates and spines, is progressively reduced towards an unarmoured condition in shallow, stained ponds. Conclusion: Threespine stickleback from pristine lakes and ponds on the Haida Gwaii archipelago demonstrate reMarchkable morphological differentiation among populations associated with habitat differences that is largely consistent with changes in predation regime, potentially mediated through a shift from post-capture to pursuit adaptations. Thus, even if founder effects occur when new populations are colonized, natural selection is a major determinant of morphological evolution. Our study emphasizes the efficacy of selective landscapes in this adaptive radiation and provides an opportunity for informed integration of emerging genome-wide data of these populations.

Integrated bacteriophages (prophages) encode host-adaptive traits and represent a sizable fraction of bacterial chromosomes. We hypothesized that natural selection shapes prophage integration patterns relative to the host genome organization. We tested this idea by detecting and studying 500 prophages of 69 strains of Escherichia and Salmonella. Phage integrases often target not only conserved genes but also intergenic positions, suggesting purifying selection for integration sites. Furthermore, most integration hotspots are conserved between the two host genera. Integration sites seem also selected at the large chromosomal scale, as they are nonrandomly organized in terms of the origin-terminus axis and the macrodomain structure. The genes of lambdoid prophages are systematically co-oriented with the bacterial replication fork and display the host high frequency of polarized FtsK-orienting polar sequences motifs required for chromosome segregation. matS motifs are strongly avoided by prophages suggesting counter selection of motifs disrupting macrodomains. These results show how natural selection for seamless integration of prophages in the chromosome shapes the evolution of the bacterium and the phage. First, integration sites are highly conserved for many millions of years favoring lysogeny over the lytic cycle for temperate phages. Second, the global distribution of prophages is intimately associated with the chromosome structure and the patterns of gene expression. Third, the phage endures selection for DNA motifs that pertain exclusively to the biology of the prophage in the bacterial chromosome. Understanding prophage genetic adaptation sheds new lights on the coexistence of horizontal transfer and organized bacterial genomes.

Nevertheless, reliable and systematic inference of functionally relevant information from these masses of data remains challenging. The aim of this review is to highlight how the Gene Ontology (GO) database can be of use in resolving this challenge. The GO provides a largely species-neutral source of information on the molecular function, biological role and cellular location of tens of thousands of gene products. As it is designed to be species-neutral, the GO is well suited for cross-species use, meaning that, functional annotation derived from model organisms can be transferred to inferred orthologues in newly sequenced species. In other words, the GO can provide gene annotation information for species with nonannotated genomes. In this review, we describe the GO database, how functional information is linked with genes/gene products in model organisms, and how molecular ecologists can utilize this information to annotate their own data. Then, we outline various applications of GO for enhancing the understanding of molecular basis of traits in ecologically relevant species. We also highlight potential pitfalls, provide step-by-step recommendations for conducting a sound study in nonmodel organisms, suggest avenues for future research and outline a strategy for maximizing the benefits of a more ecological and evolutionary genomics-oriented ontology by ensuring its compatibility with the GO.

However, this hypothesis appears inconsistent with recent reconstructions of early hominin diet based on dental microwear and stable isotopes. Thus, it is likely that either the diets of some australopiths included a high proportion of foods these taxa were poorly adapted to consume (i.e., foods that they would not have processed efficiently), or that aspects of what we thought we knew about the functional morphology of teeth must be wrong. Evaluation of these possibilities requires a recognition that analyses based on microwear, isotopes, finite element modeling, and enamel chips and cracks each test different types of hypotheses and allow different types of inferences. Microwear and isotopic analyses are best suited to reconstructing broad dietary patterns, but are limited in their ability to falsify specific hypotheses about morphological adaptation. Conversely, finite element analysis is a tool for evaluating the mechanical basis of form-function relationships, but says little about the frequency with which specific behaviors were performed or the particular types of food that were consumed. Enamel chip and crack analyses are means of both reconstructing diet and examining biomechanics. We suggest that current evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that certain derived australopith traits are adaptations for consuming hard foods, but that australopiths had generalized diets that could include high proportions of foods that were both compliant and tough.

Species of the Australian Gehyra gecko radiation have historically proven difficult to delimit due the group's uniform, almost continent-wide geographic distribution and conservative morphology, contrasting high chromosomal and genetic diversity. Using an integrated approach to species delimitation taking advantage of morphological, geographic distributional and multi-locus genetic data, we investigate the diversity within three Gehyra species from the Australian arid zone. Our results show that these species represent eight distinct phylogenetic lineages, which display different patterns of morphological distinction and reproductive isolation. Using a recently developed Bayesian species delimitation method, we also find different levels of support for putative species dependent on priors for population size and timing of diversification assumed. Our results show that the current taxonomy does not adequately account for the diversity of the group. Discrepancies between lines of evidence indicate that diversification of the group is recent and ongoing, thus posing challenges for both species concepts and delimitation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Such 'experimental evolution' approaches offer a degree of resolution of evolutionary processes and their underlying genetics that is difficult or even impossible to achieve in more traditional comparative and retrospective analyses. In principle, experimental populations can be monitored for phenotypic and genetic changes with any desired level of replication and measurement precision, facilitating progress on fundamental and previously unresolved questions in evolutionary biology. Here, we sumMarchize 10 invited papers in which experimental evolution is making significant progress on a variety of fundamental questions. We conclude by briefly considering future directions in this very active field of research, emphasizing the importance of quantitative tests of theories and the emerging role of genome-wide re-sequencing.

This paper aims to provide a mathematical description of the inclusive fitness theory. Specifically, we provide a general framework based on a Marchkov chain that can implement basic models of inclusive fitness. Our framework is based on the probability distribution of offspring-to-parent map, from which the key concepts of the theory, such as fitness function, relatedness and inclusive fitness, are derived in a straightforward manner. We prove theorems showing that inclusive fitness always provides a correct prediction on which of two competing genes more frequently appears in the long run in the Marchkov chain. As an application of the theorems, we prove a general formula of the optimal dispersal rate in the Wright's island model with recurrent mutations. We also show the existence of the critical mutation rate, which does not depend on the number of islands and below which a positive dispersal rate evolves. Our framework can also be applied to lattice or network structured populations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This has unappreciated implications for understanding the selective advantage of psychopathic traits. Although clinical psychopathy is typically construed as a strategy of unconditional defection, subclinical psychopathy may promote strategic conditional defection, broadening the adaptive niche of psychopathy within human societies. To test this, we focus on a ubiquitous real-life source of conditional behaviour: the expected relational value of social partners, both in terms of their quality and the likely quantity of future interactions with them. We allow for conversational interaction among participants prior to their playing an unannounced, one-shot prisoner's dilemma game, which fosters naturalistic interpersonal evaluation and conditional behaviour, while controlling punishment and reputation effects. Individuals scoring higher on factor 1 (callous affect, interpersonal manipulation) of the Levenson self-report psychopathy scale defected conditionally on two kinds of low-value partners: those who interrupted them more during the conversation, and those with whom they failed to discover cues to future interaction. Both interaction effects support the hypothesis that subclinical priMarchy psychopathy potentiates defection on those with low expected relational value. These data clarify the function and form of psychopathic traits, while highlighting adaptive variation in human social strategies.

The fate of the onychophoran antenna (or any appendage-like precursor), also called the priMarchy antenna, has been discussed intensively, and there are conflicting suggestions that this anteriormost non-segmental appendage gave rise either to the arthropod labrum or, alternatively, to the so-called frontal filaments found in certain crustaceans. Our data on early axogenesis in anostracan crustaceans show that even in the earliest embryos, before the antennula and antennal nerves are developed, the circumoral anlagen of the brain display very prominent nerves which run into the frontal filament organ (also known as the cavity receptor organ). This situation resembles the development of the antennal nerves in onychophorans, which leads us to conclude that the frontal filaments are indeed homologous to the priMarchy antenna. Frontal filaments also appear to be more common in crustaceans than previously thought, removing the need for a complicated scenario of transformation from a priMarchy antenna into the labrum.

To gain insight into the evolutionary origins and spread of resistance and to inform glyphosate resistance management strategies, we investigated the geographical distribution of glyphosate resistance in C.canadensis across and surrounding the Central Valley, its spatial relationship to groundwater protection areas (GWPA), and the genetic diversity and population structure and history using microsatellite Marchkers. Frequencies of resistant individuals in 42 sampled populations were positively correlated with the size of GWPA within counties. Analyses of population genetic structure also supported spread of resistance in these areas. Bayesian clustering and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) analyses revealed multiple independent origins of resistance within the Central Valley. Based on parameter estimation in the ABC analyses, resistant genotypes underwent expansion after glyphosate use began in agriculture, but many years before it was detected. Thus, diversity in weed control practices prior to herbicide regulation in GWPA probably kept resistance frequencies low. Regionally coordinated efforts to reduce seed dispersal and selection pressure are needed to manage glyphosate resistance in C.canadensis.

Here we reconstruct the phylogeny of Collemataceae using Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses based on mitochondrial (mtSSU rDNA) and nuclear (nuLSU rDNA, Beta-tubulin and MCM7) Marchkers of 70 Collemataceae species. We studied the evolution of four morphological and ecological characters traditionally used to delimit genera and infra-generic groups. Finally, we tested if differences in branch-lengths between clades are due to differences in rates of molecular evolution. Eleven strongly supported groups were recovered in the resulting well-resolved and well-supported phylogeny. The presence/absence of a eucortex, which is currently used as the cardinal character to define genera in the group, does not characterize monophyletic groups corresponding to the genera as currently circumscribed. Ancestral state reconstruction indicates that the most recent common ancestor of the jelly lichens most likely was saxicolous/terricolous, lacked a tomentum, and had transversally Septembertate ascospores. Although the cortex state could not be reconstructed for the ancestor of the family, our observations indicate that a lack of cortex may have an evolutionary advantage in saxicolous/terricolous species in semi-arid environments, as non-corticate species tends to be larger and occur in higher frequency and abundance in such regions, compared to corticate species. A significant evidence for faster evolutionary rates was found in a lineage mainly including taxa that occur in the wet tropics and humid temperate regions, compared to other lineages. We suggest that this can explain the greater diversity of Collemataceae in tropical and humid areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	June 22, 2013Genome size in Filago L.

The aim of this study was to analyse the nuclear genome size in a phylogenetic framework in order to evaluate the systematic significance of this trait to provide insights into the dynamics of genome size evolution and to assess relationships among DNA content, specific life and ecological features within the study group. A holoploid genome size of 76 samples corresponding to 27 taxa was determined using flow cytometry, which represents the first estimates of genome size in Bombycilaena, Filago, Ifloga and Logfia. Chromosome counts were performed for six species. Parsimony and Bayesian analysis of ITS, ETS and rpl32-trnL intergenic spacer sequence data were used to construct molecular phylogenetic trees. The evolution of genome size was investigated troughout the Brownian motion model with the three scaling parameters lambda, kappa and delta. The mean 2C-value in the Filago group is relatively low (1.3644 +/- A 0.0079 pg) and homogeneous among species. A high degree of congruence was found between genome size distribution and the major phylogenetic lineages obtained. The generally accepted assumption that annual, ephemeral and autogamous species show low genome sizes was confirmed. Also the relatively high DNA contents found for a couple of species could be correlated with their highly specific ecological requirements. Phylogeny seems to represent the most important factor explaining the pattern of DNA amount variation in the Filago group. The DNA amount does not seem to be strongly influenced by selection.

In this study, an integrative revision of the genus is performed, based on a large number of specimens and geographical sampling. As a result, (1) the diagnostic characters at the genus level are re-described, (2) Purpuraria magna n. sp. based on morphological, morphometric and genetic data is described and (3) the taxonomic status of a formerly described subspecies is clarified. Intraspecific and interspecific morphometric differences have been found, indicating that the genus is undergoing a process of morphological diversification. Nevertheless, the possibility of interspecific mating between individuals of the two species is suggested, because no significant differences have been found between their respective calling songs. Genetic analyses using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences suggest that P. erna and P. magna are recent species with evidences of secondary contact episodes in the past.

In addition to Pijnackeria hispanica, the tetraploid all-female type species, molecular, karyological and SEM investigations led to the recognition of four bisexual and one triploid unisexual new species. Bisexuals' karyotypes (2n = 37/38) differ for minute traits and the haploid set is repeated, with few differences, three or four times in the polyploids that appeared to be of hybrid origin. Diagnostic morphological traits were found among body size parameters, antennal articles, male cerci, ovipositor valve and egg chorionic features. All species commonly feed on the broom Sarothamnus scoparius, but habitat disturbance appeared to induce food plant shifts. Moreover, trends from bisexuality to unisexuality through spanandry, probably related to habitat disruption, have been witnessed. The diploid species (Pijnackeria lucianae, Pijnackeria barbarae, Pijnackeria lelongi and Pijnackeria originis) have small ranges, while the polyploid hybrids (Pijnackeria masettii and P. hispanica) spread through Spain and Southern France, featuring a clear geographic parthenogenesis scenario, by colonizing wide areas and likely displacing their ancestors, or even leading them to extinction. Cyclic climatic changes and natural or anthropic habitat fragmentation may have been also of relevance in shaping present-day distribution.

Repairing mismatches in heteroduplexes often leads to single nucleotide substitutions in a process known as gene conversion. Gene conversion was shown to be GC-biased in different organisms that is, a W(A or T)S(G or C) substitution is more likely in this process than a SW substitution. Here, we show that the insertion/deletion ratio for short noncoding indels that reach fixation between species is positively correlated with the recombination rate in Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This correlation is both due to an increase of the fixation rate of insertions and Decemberrease of the fixation rate of deletions in regions of high recombination. Whole-genome data on indel polymorphism and divergence in D. melanogaster rule out mutation biases and selection as the cause of this trend, pointing to insertion-biased gene conversion as the most likely explanation. The bias toward insertions is the strongest for single-nucleotide indels, and Decemberreases with indel length. In regions of high recombination rate this bias leads to an up to approximate to 5-fold excess of fixed short insertions over deletions, and substantially affects the evolution of DNA segments.

Despite extensive theoretical work, the exact processes and mechanisms of recombination suppression and differentiation are not well understood. In threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a different sex chromosome system has recently evolved by a fusion between the Y chromosome and an autosome in the Japan Sea lineage, which diverged from the ancestor of other lineages approximately 2 Ma. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics and differentiation processes of sex chromosomes based on comparative analyses of these divergent lineages using 63 microsatellite loci. Both chromosome-wide differentiation patterns and phylogenetic inferences with X and Y alleles indicated that the ancestral sex chromosomes were extensively differentiated before the divergence of these lineages. In contrast, genetic differentiation appeared to have proceeded only in a small region of the neo-sex chromosomes. The recombination maps constructed for the Japan Sea lineage indicated that recombination has been suppressed or reduced over a large region spanning the ancestral and neo-sex chromosomes. Chromosomal regions exhibiting genetic differentiation and suppressed or reduced recombination were detected continuously and sequentially in the neo-sex chromosomes, suggesting that differentiation has gradually spread from the fusion point following the extension of recombination suppression. Our study illustrates an ongoing process of sex chromosome differentiation, providing empirical support for the theoretical model postulating that recombination suppression and differentiation proceed in a gradual manner in the very early stage of sex chromosome evolution.

In zoology, studies of this kind have largely been restricted to Bilateria. Hexactinellids (glass sponges) readily lend themselves to test such an approach for early-branching (non-bilaterian) animals: they have a long and rich fossil record, but for certain taxa paleontological evidence is still scarce or ambiguous. Furthermore, there is a lack of consensus for taxonomic interpretations, and discrepancies exist between neontological and paleontological classification systems. Using conservative fossil calibration constraints and the largest molecular phylogenetic data set assembled for this group, we infer divergence times of crown-group Hexactinellida in a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock framework. With some notable exceptions, our results are largely congruent with interpretations of the hexactinellid fossil record, but also indicate long periods of undocumented evolution for several groups. This study illustrates the potential of an integrated molecular/paleobiological approach to reconstructing the evolution of challenging groups of organisms.

Particularly for lineages that experienced rapid diversification, lack of sufficient information may lead to inconsistent and unstable results and a low degree of resolution. Coincidentally, such rapidly diversifying taxa are often among the biologically most interesting groups. Aphids provide such an example. Due to rapid adaptive diversification, they feature variability in many interesting biological traits, but consequently they are also a challenging group in which to resolve phylogeny. Particularly within the family Aphididae, many interesting evolutionary questions remain unanswered due to phylogenetic uncertainties. In this study, we show that molecular data derived from the symbiotic bacteria of the genus Buchnera can provide a more powerful tool than the aphid-derived sequences. We analyze 255 Buchnera gene sequences from 70 host aphid species and compare the resulting trees to the phylogenies previously retrieved from aphid sequences, only. We find that the host and symbiont data do not conflict for any major phylogenetic conclusions. Also, we demonstrate that the symbiont-derived phylogenies support some previously questionable relationships and provide new insights into aphid phylogeny and evolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

We applied a multivariate approach to reveal the mechanistic pathways by which variation in exploratory and aggressive behaviour is translated into variation in reproductive success in a natural population of blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Using path analysis, we demonstrate a key role for provisioning behaviour in mediating the link between personality and reproductive success (number of fledged offspring). Aggressive males fed their nestlings at lower rates than less aggressive individuals. At the same time, their low parental investment was associated with increased female effort, thereby positively affecting fledgling production. Whereas male exploratory behaviour was unrelated to provisioning behaviour and reproductive success, fast-exploring females fed their offspring at higher rates and initiated breeding earlier, thus increasing reproductive success. Our findings provide strong support for specific mechanistic pathways linking components of behavioural syndromes to reproductive success. Importantly, relationships between behavioural phenotypes and reproductive success were obscured when considering simple bivariate relationships, underlining the importance of adopting multivariate views and statistical tools as path analysis to the study of behavioural evolution.

A diversity of barriers exist, acting before, during and after mating. To understand speciation and coexistence, these barriers need to be quantified and their potential interactions revealed. We use the hybridising field crickets Gryllus bimaculatus and G. campestris as a model to understand the full compliment and relative strength of reproductive barriers. We find that males of both species prefer conspecific females, but the effect is probably too weak to represent a barrier. In contrast, prezygotic barriers caused by females being more attracted to conspecific male song and preferentially mounting and mating with conspecifics are strong and asymmetric. Postzygotic barriers vary in direction reductions in fecundity and egg viability create selection against hybridisation, but hybrids live longer than pure-bred individuals. Hybrid females show a strong preference for G. bimaculatus songs, which together with a complete lack of hybridisation by G. campestris females, suggests that asymmetric gene flow is likely. For comparison, we review reproductive barriers that have been identified between other Gryllids and conclude that multiple barriers are common. Different species pairs are Septemberarated by qualitatively different combinations of barriers, suggesting that reproductive isolation and even the process of speciation itself may vary widely even within closely related groups.

In colonies of permanently social spiders of the genus Stegodyphus less than half of the females reproduce, while all females, including nonreproducers, perform suicidal allo-maternal care. Some theoretical models suggest that reproductive skew is a result of contest competition within colonies, leading to size hierarchies where only the largest females become reproducers. We investigated the effect of competition on within-group body size variation over sixmonths in S. dumicola, by manipulating food level and colony size. We found no evidence that competition leads to increased size asymmetry within colonies, suggesting that contest competition may not be the proximate explanation for reproductive skew. Within-colony body size variation was high already in the juvenile stage, and did not increase over the course of the experiment, suggesting that body size variation is shaped at an early stage. This might facilitate task specialization within colonies and ensure colony-level reproductive output by early allocation of reproductive roles. We suggest that reproductive skew in social spiders may be an adaptation to sociality selected through inclusive fitness benefits of allo-maternal care as well as colony-level benefits maximizing colony survival and production.

MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	genotyping-by-sequencing hierarchical Bayesian model population genomics resequencing	MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA WIDE ASSOCIATION F-ST NEXT-GENERATION HIGH-ALTITUDE ADAPTATION EVOLUTION INFERENCE MarchKERS DROSOPHILA	Research in molecular ecology is now often based on large numbers of DNA sequence reads. Given a time and financial budget for DNA sequencing, the question arises as to how to allocate the finite number of sequence reads among three dimensions: (i) sequencing individual nucleotide positions repeatedly and achieving high confidence in the true genotype of individuals, (ii) sampling larger numbers of individuals from a population, and (iii) sampling a larger fraction of the genome. Leaving aside the question of what fraction of the genome to sample, we analyze the trade-off between repeatedly sequencing the same nucleotide position (coverage depth) and the number of individuals in the sample. We review simple Bayesian models for allele frequencies and utilize these in the analysis of how to obtain maximal information about population genetic parameters. The models indicate that sampling larger numbers of individuals, at the expense of coverage depth per nucleotide position, provides more information about population parameters. Dividing the sequencing effort maximally among individuals and obtaining approximately one read per locus and individual (1xcoverage) yields the most information about a population. Some analyses require genetic parameters for individuals, in which case Bayesian population models also support inference from lower coverage sequence data than are required for simple likelihood models. Low coverage sequencing is not only sufficient to support inference, but it is optimal to design studies to utilize low coverage because they will yield highly accurate and precise parameter estimates based on more individuals or sites in the genome.

Here, we present a quantitatively evaluated and broadly applicable method to predict eukaryotic ubiquitinating enzymes (UBE) and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) and its application to 50 distinct genomes belonging to four of the five major phylogenetic supergroups of eukaryotes: unikonts (including metazoans, fungi, choanozoa, and amoebozoa), excavates, chromalveolates, and plants. Our method relies on a collection of profile hidden Marchkov models, and we demonstrate its superior performance (coverage and classification accuracy > 99%) by identifying approximately 25% and approximately 35% additional UBE and DUB genes in yeast and human, which had not been reported before. In yeast, we predict 85 UBE and 24 DUB genes, for 814 UBE and 107 DUB genes in the human genome. Most UBE and DUB families are present in all eukaryotic lineages, with plants and animals harboring massively enlarged repertoires of ubiquitin ligases. Unicellular organisms, on the other hand, typically harbor less than 300 UBEs and less than 40 DUBs per genome. Ninety-one UBE/DUB genes are orthologous across all four eukaryotic supergroups, and these likely represent a primordial core of enzymes of the ubiquitination system probably dating back to the first eukaryotes approximately 2 billion years ago. Our genome-wide predictions are available through the Database of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes ( ext-link-type=uri xlink:href=http://www.DUDE-db.org xmlns:xlink=http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink>www.DUDE-db.org), where users can also perform advanced sequence and phylogenetic analyses and submit their own predictions.

Although the biochemistry of RNAi has been detailed in model organisms, very little is known about the broad-scale patterns and forces that have shaped RNAi evolution. Here, we provide a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the Dicer protein family, which carries out the initial RNA recognition and processing steps in the RNAi pathway. We show that Dicer genes duplicated and diversified independently in early animal and plant evolution, coincident with the origins of multicellularity. We identify a strong signature of long-term protein-coding adaptation that has continually reshaped the RNA-binding pocket of the plant Dicer responsible for antiviral immunity, suggesting an evolutionary arms race with viral factors. We also identify key changes in Dicer domain architecture and sequence leading to specialization in either gene-regulatory or protective functions in animal and plant paralogs. As a whole, these results reveal a dynamic picture in which the evolution of Dicer function has driven elaboration of parallel RNAi functional pathways in animals and plants.

For rooting, polymorphic characters among the group of interest (ingroup) must be compared to those of a relative (outgroup) that diverged before the last common ancestor (LCA) of the ingroup. Problems arise if an outgroup does not exist, is unknown, or is so distant that few characters are shared, in which case duplicated genes originating before the LCA can be used as proxy outgroups to root diverse phylogenies. Here, we describe a genome-wide expansion of this technique that can be used to solve problems at the other end of the evolutionary scale: where ingroup individuals are all very closely related to each other, but the next closest relative is very distant. We used shared orthologous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 10 whole genome sequences of Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever in humans, to create a robust, but unrooted phylogeny. To maximize the number of characters informative about the rooting, we searched entire genomes for polymorphic duplicated regions where orthologs of each paralog could be identified so that the paralogs could be used to root the tree. Recent radiations, such as those of emerging pathogens, often pose rooting challenges due to a lack of ingroup variation and large genomic differences with known outgroups. Using a phylogenomic approach, we created a robust, rooted phylogeny for C. burnetii.

During a single lunge, rorquals rapidly engulf a large volume of prey-laden water at high speed, which they then filter to capture suspended prey. Engulfment biomechanics are mostly governed by the coordinated opening and closing of the mandibles at large gape angles, which differentially exposes the floor of the oral cavity to oncoming flow. The mouth area in rorquals is delimited by unfused bony mandibles that form kinetic linkages to each other and with the skull. The relative scale and morphology of these skeletal elements have profound consequences for the energetic efficiency of foraging in these gigantic predators. Here, we performed a morphometric study of rorqual mandibles using a data set derived from a survey of museum specimens. Across adult specimens of extant balaenopterids, mandibles range in size from approximate to 16m in length, and at their upper limit they represent the single largest osteological element of any vertebrate, living or extinct. Our analyses determined that rorqual mandibles exhibit positive allometry, whereby the relative size of these mandibles becomes greater with increasing body size. These robust scaling relationships allowed us to predict mandible length for fragmentary remains (e.g. incomplete and/or fossil specimens), as we demonstrated for two partial mandibles from the latest Miocene of California, USA, and for mandibles from previously described fossil balaenopterids. Furthermore, we showed the allometry of mandible length to body size in extant mysticetes, which hints at fundamental developmental constraints in mysticetes despite their ecomorphological differences in feeding styles. Lastly, we outlined how our findings can be used to test hypotheses about the antiquity and evolution of lunge feeding.(c) 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 108, 586-599.

We recently identified a S100-like cDNA from the tamMarch wallaby (Macropus eugenii) stomach. Phylogentic analysis shows wallaby S100A19 forms a new clade with other Marchsupial and monotreme S100A19, while this group shows similarity to eutherian S100A7 and S100A15 genes. This is also supported by amino acid and domain comparisons. We show S100A19 is developmentally-regulated in the tamMarch wallaby gut by demonstrating the gene is expressed in the forestomach of young animals at a time when the diet consists of only milk, but is absent in older animals when the diet is supplemented with herbage. During this transition the forestomach phenotype changes from a gastric stomach into a fermentation sac and intestinal flora changes with diet. We also show that S100A19 is expressed in the mamMarchy gland of the tamMarch wallaby only during specific stages of lactation the gene is up-regulated during pregnancy and involution and not expressed during the milk production phase of lactation. Comparison of the tamMarch wallaby S100A19 protein sequence with S100 protein sequences from eutherian, monotreme and other Marchsupial species suggest the Marchsupial S100A19 has two functional EF hand domains, and an extended His tail. An evolutionary analysis of S100 family proteins was carried out to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the S100 family member functions. We propose that S100A19 gene/protein is the ancestor of the eutherian S100A7 gene/protein, which has subsequently modified its original function in eutherians. This modified function may have arisen due to differentiation of evolutionary pressures placed on gut and mamMarchy gland developmental during mammal evolution. The highly regulated differential expression patterns of S100A19 in the tamMarch wallaby suggests that S100A19 may play a role in gut development, which differs between metatherians and eutherians, and/or include a potential antibacterial role in order to establish the correct flora and protect against spiral bacteria in the immature forestomach. In the mamMarchy gland it may protect the tissue from infection at times of vulnerability during the lactation cycle. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In all cases, the most abundant repeats were LTR retrotransposons, but the particular families that had become dominant were found to be different in the Pennisetum, Saccharum, Sorghum and Zea lineages. One element family, Huck, has been very active in all of the studied species over the last few million years. This suggests the transmittal of an active or quiescent autonomous set of Huck elements to this lineage at the founding of the panicoids. Similarly, independent recent activity of Ji and Opie elements in Zea and of Leviathan elements in Sorghum and Saccharum species suggests that members of these families with exceptional activation potential were present in the genome(s) of the founders of these lineages. In a detailed analysis of the Zea lineage, the combined action of several families of LTR retrotransposons were observed to have approximately doubled the genome size of Zea luxurians relative to Zea mays and Zea diploperennis in just the last few million years. One of the LTR retrotransposon amplification bursts in Zea may have been initiated by polyploidy, but the great majority of transposable element activations are not. Instead, the results suggest random activation of a few or many LTR retrotransposons families in particular lineages over evolutionary time, with some families especially prone to future activation and hyper-amplification.

In this group, the basal-rooted species priMarchily occupy the subtidal habitat, whereas the species in the most distal clades are found in the intertidal. We tested multiple evolutionary models to determine whether changes in body size and changes in number of scales are adaptive for habitat use in sculpins. Based on a statistically robust, highly resolved molecular phylogeny of 26 species of sculpins, in combination with morphometric and habitat affinity data, our analyses show that an adaptive model based on habitat use best explains changes in body size and number of scales. The habitat model was statistically supported over models of neutral evolution, stabilizing selection across all habitats, and three clade-based models. We suggest that loss of scales and reduction of body size in the intertidal may facilitate cutaneous breathing in air when tidepools become hypoxic during low tides. This study demonstrates how the combined use of phylogenetic, ecological and statistical approaches helps to identify traits that are likely adaptive to Novemberel habitats.

These differences may be either due to immediate effects of seasonally variable environment on organisms (responsive plasticity) or rely on presumably adaptive responses of organisms to cues signalizing forthcoming seasonal changes (anticipatory plasticity). When directly developing individuals of insects are larger than their overwintering conspecifics, the between-generation differences are typically ascribed to responsive plasticity in larval growth. We tested this hypothesis using the papilionid butterly Iphiclides podalirius as a model species. In laboratory experiments, we demonstrated that seasonal differences in food quality could not explain the observed size difference. Similarly, the size differences are not likely to be explained by the immediate effects of ambient temperature and photoperiod on larval growth. The qualitative pattern of natural size differences between the directly developing and diapausing butterflies could be reproduced in the laboratory as a response to photoperiod, indicating anticipatory character of the response. Directly developing and diapausing individuals followed an identical growth trajectory until the end of the last larval instar, with size differences appearing just a few days before pupation. Taken together, various lines of evidence suggest that between-generation size differences in I. podalirius are not caused by immediate effects of environmental factors on larval growth. Instead, these differences rather represent anticipatory plasticity and are thus likely to have an adaptive explanation. It remains currently unclear, whether the seasonal differences in adult size per se are adaptive, or if they constitute co-product of processes related to the diapause. Our study shows that it may be feasible to distinguish between different types of plasticity on the basis of empirical data even if fitness cannot be directly measured, and contributes to the emerging view about the predominantly adaptive nature of seasonal polyphenisms in insects.

To dissect the environmental differences in selection on life history QTL across climatic regions, we grew a panel of interconnected recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Arabidopsis thaliana in four field sites across its native European range. For each environment, we mapped QTL for growth, reproductive timing and development. Several QTL were pleiotropic across environments, three colocalizing with known functional polymorphisms in flowering time genes (CRY2, FRI and MAF2-5), but major QTL differed across field sites, showing conditional neutrality. We used structural equation models to trace selection paths from QTL to lifetime fitness in each environment. Only three QTL directly affected fruit number, measuring fitness. Most QTL had an indirect effect on fitness through their effect on bolting time or leaf length. Influence of life history traits on fitness differed dramatically across sites, resulting in different patterns of selection on reproductive timing and underlying QTL. In two oceanic field sites with high prereproductive mortality, QTL alleles contributing to early reproduction resulted in greater fruit production, conferring selective advantage, whereas alleles contributing to later reproduction resulted in larger size and higher fitness in a continental site. This demonstrates how environmental variation leads to change in both QTL effect sizes and direction of selection on traits, justifying the persistence of allelic polymorphism at life history QTL across the species range.

However, evidence supporting this assumption is still scarce. Genome scans have often identified loci with atypical patterns of genetic differentiation (i.e. outliers) indicative of selection processes. Using microsatellite- and AFLP-based genome scans, we looked for evidence of selection following the introduction of the mollusc Crepidula fornicata. Native to the northwestern Atlantic, this gastropod has become an emblematic invader since its introduction during the 19th and 20th centuries in the northeastern Atlantic and northeastern Pacific. We examined 683 individuals from seven native and 15 introduced populations spanning the latitudinal introduction and native ranges of the species. Our results confirmed the previously documented high genetic diversity in native and introduced populations with little genetic structure between the two ranges, a pattern typical of Marchine invaders. Analysing 344 loci, no outliers were detected between the introduced and native populations or in the introduced range. The genomic sampling may have been insufficient to reveal selection especially if it acts on traits determined by a few genes. Eight outliers were, however, identified within the native range, underlining a genetic singularity congruent with a well-known biogeographical break along the Florida. Our results call into question the relevance of AFLP genome scans in detecting adaptation on the timescale of biological invasions: genome scans often reveal long-term adaptation involving numerous genes throughout the genome but seem less effective in detecting recent adaptation from pre-existing variation on polygenic traits. This study advocates other methods to detect selection effects during biological invasionsfor example on phenotypic traits, although genome scans may remain useful for elucidating introduction histories.

How a transition in the number of SI loci can occur and the consequences of such events for the population's genetics and dynamics have not been studied theoretically. Here, we provide analytical descriptions of two transition mechanisms: linkage of the two SI loci (scenario 1) and the loss of function of one incompatibility gene within a mating type of a population with two SI loci (scenario 2). We show that invasion of populations by the new mating type form depends on whether the fitness of the new type is lowered, and on the allelic diversity of the SI loci and the recombination between the two SI loci in the starting population. Moreover, under scenario 1, it also depends on the frequency of the SI alleles that became linked. We demonstrate that, following invasion, complete transitions in the reproductive system occurs under scenario 2 and is predicted only for small populations under scenario 1. Interestingly, such events are associated with a drastic reduction in mating type number.

Herkogamy and dichogamy both can achieve reductions in the extent of self-interference, but they may have different roles in minimizing self-interference in a single species. We used four self-incompatible Epimedium species to explore the roles of herkogamy and dichogamy in avoiding self-interference and to test the hypothesis that herkogamy and dichogamy may be Septemberarated and become selected preferentially in the taxa. Two species (E.franchetii and E.mikinorii) expressed strong herkogamy and weak protogyny (adichogamy), whereas another two species (E.sutchuenense and E.leptorrhizum) expressed slight herkogamy and partial protandry. Field investigations indicated that there was no physical self-interference between male function and female function regarding pollen removal and pollen deposition in all species. Self-pollination (autonomous or facilitated) was greater in species with slight herkogamy than in those with strong herkogamy. Artificial pollination treatments revealed that self-pollination could reduce outcrossed female fertility in all species, and we found evidence that self-interference reduced seed set in E.sutchuenense and E.leptorrhizum in the field, but not in E.franchetii and E.mikinorii. These results indicate that well-developed herkogamy is more effective compared with dichogamy in avoiding self-interference in the four species. In genus Epimedium, herkogamy instead of dichogamy should be selected preferentially and evolved as an effective mechanism for avoiding self-interference and might not need to evolve linked with dichogamy.

Crociseris is one of the three main sections of western Eurasian/northern African Senecio species. Previous studies indicated that species commonly assigned to this section are closely related to those of sect. Doria. The aim of the research presented here was to test the morphology-based delimitation of sect. Crociseris using phylogenetic analyses of plastid and nuclear DNA sequence data. The results of these studies are used to propose a new delimitation of sect. Crociseris. Species of sect. Doria were nested within a clade formed by species of sect. Crociseris. Section Doria is therefore best considered a synonym of sect. Crociseris. In addition, S. racemosus, traditionally included in sect. Crociseris, is transferred to the genus Jacobaea. One of the two J. kirghisica specimens that were sequenced contains ITS copies that are most closely related to those of sect. Crociseris as well as copies that nest among ITS accessions of Jacobaea. This suggests intergeneric hybridization between Senecio and Jacobaea.

Based upon patterns of intraspecific diversity and interspecific divergence, c. 50-75% of nonsynonymous polymorphisms are subject to strong purifying selection and 1% of the sampled genes harbour a signature of positive selection. Combining polymorphism with expression data, we estimated the distribution of fitness effects and found that the proportion of deleterious mutations is significantly greater for expressed genes than for genes with undetected transcripts (nonexpressed) in a previous RNA-seq experiment and greater for broadly expressed genes than those expressed in only a single tissue. Expression level is the strongest correlate of evolutionary rates at nonsynonymous sites, and despite multiple genomic features being significantly correlated with evolutionary rates, they explain less than 20% of the variation in nonsynonymous rates (dN) and <15% of the variation in either synonymous rates (dS) or dN:dS. Among putative targets of selection were genes involved in defence against pathogens and herbivores, genes with roles in mediating the relationship with rhizobial symbionts and one-third of annotated histone-lysine methyltransferases. Adaptive evolution of the methyltransferases suggests that positive selection in gene expression may have occurred through evolution of enzymes involved in epigenetic modification.

The positive allometry theory' suggests that hyperallometry is a rule in all-secondary sexual traits, whereas the display hypothesis' suggests that only males in good condition will exhibit hyperallometric sexual display traits. In the present study, we investigated: (1) the condition-dependence nature (by using two diet treatments that varied in the amount of food provided to the larvae) of a sexually selected trait (wing pigmentation WP) in recently-emerged adults of the American rubyspot damselfly, Hetaerina americana, and (2) the scaling relationship between WP and body size (wing and body length) in the rubyspot damselflies H.americana and Hetaerina vulnerata, according to alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs territorial and nonterritorial males). First, we found support that indicated that diet positively affected WP length, although there was no significant WP allometric pattern in relation to diet regimes. Second, WP was hyperallometric in both Hetaerina species. WP size was similar between ARTs and, in H.americana (but not H.vulnerata), nonterritorial males showed steeper slopes than territorial males when wing length was used. The results obtained support the notion that sexual traits are hyperallometric, although there is no clear pattern in relation to ARTs.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 108, 521-533.

The current study examines substrate use and positional behavior of tiny-sized Eurasian harvest mice (Micromys minutus) as living models for inferring the evolution of versatile behavior, flexible branch use and pedal grasping in early small-sized primates. Micromys exhibits a diverse locomotor repertoire composed of clambering and climbing, and uses postural modes requiring secure pedal grasping. It also makes considerable use of fine flexible substrates of various inclinations during both feeding/foraging and traveling. This profile seems to represent an intermediate step between stage 2 (Tupaia-stage) and stage 3 (Caluromys-stage) in Sargis et al.'s (2007) primate evolutionary scenario. Furthermore, our findings suggest that tiny size in itself brings a unique level of flexibility in posture and locomotion that has heretofore been underappreciated in the primate evolution literature.

One of the leading hypotheses, the disposable soma hypothesis, predicts a trade-off, whereby early-life investment in reproduction leads to late-life Decemberlines in survival (survival senescence). Testing this hypothesis in natural populations is challenging, but important for understanding the evolution of senescence. We used the long-term data set from a contained, predator-free population of individually MarchkedSeychelles warblers (Acrocephalus sechellensis) to investigate how age-related Decemberlines in survival are affected by early-life investment in reproduction and early-life environmental conditions. The disposable soma hypothesis predicts that higher investment in reproduction, or experiencing harsh conditions during early life, will lead to an earlier onset, and an increased rate, of senescence. We found that both sexes showed similar age-related Decemberlines in late-life survival consistent with senescence. Individuals that started breeding at a later age showed a delay in survival senescence, but this later onset of breeding did not result in a less rapid Decemberline in late-life survival. Although survival senescence was not directly related to early-life environmental conditions, age of first breeding increased with natal food availability. Therefore, early-life food availability may affect senescence by influencing age of first breeding. The disposable soma hypothesis of senescence is supported by delayed senescence in individuals that started breeding at a later age and therefore invested less in reproduction.

However, despite evidence that avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 100 Ma, ratite birds have been trapped in an arrested stage of sex chromosome divergence. We performed RNA sequencing of several tissues from male and female ostriches and assembled the transcriptome de Novembero. A total of 315 Z-linked genes fell into two categories: those that have equal expression level in the two sexes (for which Z-W recombination still occurs) and those that have a 2-fold excess of male expression (for which Z-W recombination has ceased). We suggest that failure to evolve dosage compensation has constrained sex chromosome divergence in this basal avian lineage. Our results indicate that dosage compensation is a prerequisite for, not only a consequence of, sex chromosome evolution.

In fact, recent work has suggested an integral role of sex chromosome evolution in models of speciation. We use quantitative trait loci analysis of restriction site-associated DNA -tag single nucleotide polymorphisms to identify multiple loci responsible for sex determination and reproductively adaptive color phenotypes in Lake Malawi cichlids. We detect a complex epistatic sex system consisting of a major female heterogametic ZW locus on chromosome 5, two Septemberarate male heterogametic XY loci on chromosome 7, and two additional interacting loci on chromosomes 3 and 20. Our data support the known chromosomal linkage between orange blotch color and ZW, as well as Novemberel genetic associations between male blue nuptial color and two sex determining regions (an XY and ZW locus). These results provide further empirical evidence for a complex antagonistic sex-color system in this species flock and suggest a possible role for, and effect of, polygenic sex-determining systems in rapid evolutionary diversification.

The Red Queen hypothesis proposes that sex overcomes its costs by enabling organisms to keep pace with coevolving parasites and pathogens. If so, the few cases of stable long-term asexuality ought to be found in groups whose coevolutionary interactions with parasites are unusually weak. In theory, antagonistic coevolution will be attenuated if hosts disperse among patches within a metapopulation Septemberarately from parasites and more rapidly. We examined whether these conditions are met in natural communities of bdelloid rotifers, one of the longest-lived asexual lineages. At any life stage, these microscopic invertebrates can tolerate the complete desiccation of their ephemeral freshwater habitats, surviving as dormant propagules that are readily carried by the wind. In our field experiments, desiccation and wind transport enabled bdelloids to disperse independently of multiple fungal parasites, in both time and space. Surveys of bdelloid communities in unmanipulated moss patches confirmed that fungal parasitism was negatively correlated with extended drought and increasing height (exposure to wind). Bdelloid ecology therefore matches a key condition of models in which asexuals persist through spatio-temporal Decemberoupling from coevolving enemies.

For example, previous studies have shown that display complexity and elaborate ornamentation in lizards are associated with variables that reflect the intensity of intrasexual selection. However, these studies have relied on techniques of colour analysis based on human - rather than lizard - visual perception. Here, we use reflectance spectrophotometry and visual modelling to quantify sexual dichromatism considering the overall colour patterns of lacertids, a lizard clade in which visual signalling has traditionally been underrated. These objective methods of colour analysis reveal a large, previously unreported, degree of sexual dichromatism in lacertids. Using a comparative phylogenetic approach, we further demonstrate that sexual dichromatism is positively associated with body size dimorphism (an index of intrasexual selection), suggesting that conspicuous coloration in male lacertids has evolved to improve opponent assessment under conditions of intense male-male competition. Our findings provide the first evidence for the covariation of sexual dichromatism and sexual size dimorphism in lacertids and suggest that the prevalent role of intrasexual selection in the evolution of ornamental coloration is not restricted to the iguanian lineage, but rather may be a general trend common to many diurnal lizards.

Because sexual selection often shifts traits away from their survival optima, strong sexual selection pressures are thought to increase potential for population extinction, especially during environmental change. Sexual selection pressures may also increase the opportunity for speciation by accelerating the generation of pre-zygotic isolation among populations. These relationships remain largely untested experimentally. Here, we allow populations of baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to evolve for approximately 250 generations with altered sex ratios in order to test the effect of the strength of sexual selection on the fate of populations. We find that populations experiencing stronger sexual selection are less able to adapt to a Novemberel environment compared with populations experiencing weaker sexual selection or no sex, and that strong sexual selection erases the benefits of sexual reproduction. This pattern persists when fitness is assayed in a closely related environment. We also identify a trend that may suggest the beginning of pre-zygotic isolation between populations experiencing stronger sexual selection, though this is not statistically significant. These results highlight the importance of sexual selection in shaping macroevolutionary patterns and biodiversity.

However, environmental variation and genotype-by-environment (G x E) interactions have the potential to compromise the reliability of sexual signals. Here, we test the reliability of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) as signals of heritable aspects of male attractiveness in Drosophila simulans. We examined the heritability of male attractiveness and a measure of the difference between fathers' and sons' CHC profiles across dietary and temperature environments. Our results show that environmental heterogeneity disrupts the similarity of some components of father and son CHC profile. However, overall male attractiveness is heritable within and across environments, so that sire attractiveness is a good predictor of son attractiveness even with environmental heterogeneity. This suggests that although some male CHC signals are unreliable, attractive genotypes retain their attractiveness across environments on average.

Host plant and population specific epicuticular hydrocarbon expression influences mate choice and sexual selection	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	cactus desert GxE interaction pheromone sexual isolation sexual selection	BY-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS CUTICULAR HYDROCARBONS INCIPIENT SPECIATION GENETIC VARIANCE MATING SUCCESS COURTSHIP SONG FEMALE CHOICE LEK PARADOX EVOLUTION DIVERGENCE	Sexual signals in cactophilic Drosophila mojavensis include cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), contact pheromones that mediate female discrimination of males during courtship. CHCs, along with male courtship songs, cause premating isolation between diverged populations, and are influenced by genotypexenvironment interactions caused by different host cacti. CHC profiles of mated and unmated adult flies from a Baja California and a mainland Mexico population of D.mojavensis reared on two host cacti were assayed to test the hypothesis that male CHCs mediate within-population female discrimination of males. In multiple choice courtship trials, mated and unmated males differed in CHC profiles, indicating that females prefer males with particular blends of CHCs. Mated and unmated females significantly differed in CHC profiles as well. Adults in the choice trials had CHC profiles that were significantly different from those in pair-mated adults from no-choice trials revealing an influence of sexual selection. Females preferred different male CHC blends in each population, but the influence of host cactus on CHC variation was significant only in the mainland population indicating population-specific plasticity in CHCs. Different groups of CHCs mediated female choice-based sexual selection in each population suggesting that geographical and ecological divergence has the potential to promote divergence in mate communication systems.

Research on Garcinia L. has shown the occurrence of variations in the sexual systems of this genus, with some authors considering it as dioecious, and for some species as gynodioecious or androdioecious. The population of G. brasiliensis in the restinga of Marchica is dioecious with two individuals characterized as monoecious. Anatomical analysis showed that one has pistillate and sterile staminate flowers, being an unusual female and the other has staminate and perfect flowers (functional pollen grains and ovules), being andromonoecious. In addition, field observations, controlled hand-pollinations, reproductive phenology and anatomical analysis showed no evidence of apomixis in this Neotropical species, different from that provided in the literature for paleotropical species. However, asexual reproduction occurs through ramets suggesting that in this environment of restinga the seedlings are subjected to considerable limitations, and vegetative propagation becomes an important alternative for the occupation of the environment. Flowering episodes occurred throughout the study period, featuring a subannual and long-lasting flowering pattern mainly due to multiple blooms of male plants. The floral characters observed in G. brasiliensis are often associated with a generalist pollination system. Apis mellifera and Trigona spinipes are the effective pollinators of G. brasiliensis flowers. Our findings provide new insights into the reproductive biology of Garcinia.

Evolving host-use strategies will reflect a trade-off between selection pressures. The ecological niche of herbivorous insects is partitioned along several dimensions, and if populations remain in contact, recombination will break down associations between relevant loci. As such, genetic architecture can profoundly affect the coordinated divergence of traits and subsequently the ability to exploit Novemberel habitats. The closely related species Heliconius cydno and H.melpomene differ in mimetic colour pattern, habitat and host-plant use. We investigate the selection pressures and genetic basis underlying host-use differences in these two species. Host-plant surveys reveal that H.melpomene specializes on a single species of Passiflora. This is also true for the majority of other Heliconius species in secondary growth forest at our study site, as expected under a model of interspecific competition. In contrast, H.cydno, which uses closed-forest habitats where both Heliconius and Passiflora are less common, appears not to be restricted by competition and uses a broad selection of the available Passiflora. However, other selection pressures are likely involved, and field experiments reveal that early larval survival of both butterfly species is highest on Passiflora menispermifolia, but most Marchkedly so for H.melpomene, the specialist on that host. Finally, we demonstrate an association between host-plant acceptance and colour pattern amongst interspecific hybrids, suggesting that major loci underlying these important ecological traits are physically linked in the genome. Together, our results reveal ecological and genetic associations between shifts in habitat, host use and mimetic colour pattern that have likely facilitated both speciation and coexistence.

During the buzz, bats increase information update rates by producing vocalizations up to 220 times s(-1). The buzz's ubiquity in hawking and trawling bats implies its importance for hunting success. Superfast muscles, previously unknown in mammals, are responsible for the extreme vocalization rate. Some bats produce a second phase-buzz II-defined by a large drop in the fundamental frequency (F-0) of their calls. By doing so, bats broaden their acoustic field of view and should thereby reduce the likelihood of insect escape. We make the case that the buzz was a critical adaptation for capturing night-flying insects, and suggest that the drop in F-0 during buzz II requires Novemberel, unidentified laryngeal mechanisms in order to counteract increasing muscle tension. Furthermore, we propose that buzz II represents a countermeasure against the evasive flight of eared prey in the evolutionary arms-race that saw the independent evolution of bat-detecting ears in various groups of night-flying insects.

The screening of one or only a few individuals induces ascertainment bias. To discover SNPs for a population genomic study of the Pyrenean rocket (Sisymbrium austriacum subsp. chrysanthum), we undertook a pooled RAD-PE (Restriction site Associated DNA Paired-End sequencing) approach. RAD tags were generated from the PstI-digested pooled genomic DNA of 12 individuals sampled across the species distribution range and paired-end sequenced using Illumina technology to produce similar to 24.5Mb of sequences, covering similar to 7% of the specie's genome. Sequences were assembled into similar to 76000 contigs with a mean length of 323bp (N50=357bp, sequencing depth=24x). In all, >15000 SNPs were called, of which 47% were annotated in putative genic regions based on homology with the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Gene ontology (GO) slim categorization demonstrated that the identified SNPs covered extant genic variation well. The validation of 300 SNPs on a larger set of individuals using a KASPar assay underpinned the utility of pooled RAD-PE as an inexpensive genome-wide SNP discovery technique (success rate: 87%). In addition to SNPs, we discovered >600 putative SSR Marchkers.

In this study, we investigate controls on the evolution of organismal size using a newly compiled database of nearly 25,000 foraminiferan species and subspecies spanning the past 400 million years. We find a transition in the pattern of foraminiferan size evolution from correlation with atmospheric pO2 during the Paleozoic (400250 million years ago) to long-term stasis during the post-Paleozoic (250 million years ago to present). Thus, a dramatic shift in the evolutionary mode coincides with the most severe biotic catastrophe of the Phanerozoic (543 million years ago to present). Paleozoic tracking of pO2 was confined to Order Fusulinida, whereas Paleozoic lagenides, miliolids, and textulariids were best described by the stasis model. Stasis continued to best describe miliolids and textulariids during post-Paleozoic time, whereas random walk was the best supported mode for the other diverse orders. The shift in evolutionary dynamics thus appears to have resulted priMarchily from the selective elimination of fusulinids at the end of the Permian Period. These findings illustrate the potential for mass extinction to alter macroevolutionary dynamics for hundreds of millions of years.

Despite their popularity and economic importance, species delimitation is problematic and the infrageneric classification uncertain. We present a molecular phylogenetic study of Galanthus with the aim of resolving these issues and to better understand the evolution within the genus. Sequences of nuclear encoded nrITS, and plastid encoded matK, trnLF, ndhF, and psbK-psbI, for all currently recognised species and two naturally occurring putative hybrids, were analysed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. Phylogenetic analysis of Galanthus, based on nuclear ITS sequences, provides a well-resolved topology, including seven well-supported named clades (platyphyllus, troJanuaryus, ikariae, elwesii, nivalis, woronowii, and alpinus), and five major clades (A-E). The recovered ITS topology is in accordance with the geographical distribution of Galanthus species. The combined plastid data set provided far less resolution than that of ITS, with generally lower levels of statistical support, and one case of significant incongruence with the ITS dataset (involving G. gracilis). Phylogenetic network and hybridization analyses identified several possible hybridization events but these are more likely to be due to the result of a lack of resolution in the plastid dataset. The putative natural hybrid, G. xvalentinei nothosubsp. subplicatus, is supported by our data and analyses, whereas a hybrid origin for G. xallenii is not. ITS and plastid data indicated that some Galanthus species are in need of taxonomic recircumscription. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the social (or communication) complexity hypothesis suggests that the kinds of information that can be acquired and processed may limit the size and/or complexity of social groups that a species can maintain. We use an agent-based model to test the hypothesis that the complexity of information processed influences the computational demands involved. We show that successive increases in the kinds of information processed allow organisms to break through the glass ceilings that otherwise limit the size of social groups: larger groups can only be achieved at the cost of more sophisticated kinds of information processing that are disadvantageous when optimal group size is small. These results simultaneously support both the social brain and the social complexity hypotheses.

ASTERACEAE ALLIES ANTHEMIDEAE GENOME SIZE EVOLUTION NUMBERS PHYLOGENY SEQUENCES DNA	Somatic chromosome numbers of 47 accessions representing 28 Artemisia species are provided from Iran. Two basic chromosome numbers, x = 8, 9, each with diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid levels, were found. Different chromosome numbers, 2n = 16, 16 + 1B, 16 + 5B, 32, 48, and 2n = 18, 18 + 1B, 19, 36, 36 + 1B, 36 + 2B, 37, 49 + 2B, 49 + 3B, 51 + 6B, 54, 54 + 1B, 54 + 3B, 54 + 5B, in studied accessions were identified. Chromosome numbers are reported for the first time in three species, counts in four species are new for Iran, and other counts have been thoroughly compared to previous data. Forty percent of the studied accessions are polyploid and B-chromosome(s) are reported in 17 % of accessions. Aneuploidy and aneusomy are other relevant cytological phenomena. Some karyological parameters, total karyotype length, karyotype formula, mean value of centromeric indices, mean arm ratio, A (1) and A (2) indices, were estimated to characterize the karyotypes numerically. A (1) and A (2) indices showed that karyotypes tend to be asymmetric in polyploid and dysploid taxa. PCA analysis of all karyological parameters has shown some systematic and evolutionary implications. The consideration of all these chromosome numbers and cytogenetic mechanisms has led us to infer the different patterns of chromosomal evolution in the genus.

A closer look	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	cooperation altruistic punishment third-party punishment affective forecasting evolutionary psychology	DEMAND CHARACTERISTICS 3RD-PARTY PUNISHMENT STRONG RECIPROCITY EVOLUTION COOPERATION SOCIETIES GAMES ANGER	Some researchers have proposed that natural selection has given rise in humans to one or more adaptations for altruistically punishing on behalf of other individuals who have been treated unfairly, even when the punisher has no chance of benefiting via reciprocity or benefits to kin. However, empirical support for the altruistic punishment hypothesis depends on results from experiments that are vulnerable to potentially important experimental artefacts. Here, we searched for evidence of altruistic punishment in an experiment that precluded these artefacts. In so doing, we found that victims of unfairness punished transgressors, whereas witnesses of unfairness did not. Furthermore, witnesses' emotional reactions to unfairness were characterized by envy of the unfair individual's selfish gains rather than by moralistic anger towards the unfair behaviour. In a second experiment run independently in two Septemberarate samples, we found that previous evidence for altruistic punishment plausibly resulted from affective forecasting error-that is, limitations on humans' abilities to accurately simulate how they would feel in hypothetical situations. Together, these findings suggest that the case for altruistic punishment in humans-a view that has gained increasing attention in the biological and social sciences-has been overstated.

JOURNAL OF MAMMALIAN EVOLUTION	Sparassodonta Carnivora Competitive displacement Ecological replacement	MIOCENE BORHYAENOIDS MAMMALIA PAMPEAN REGION ARGENTINA FOSSIL RECORD BIOTIC INTERCHANGE POSTCRANIAL SKELETON CARNIVOROUS MAMMALS FAUNAL TURNovemberER BODY-SIZE PALEOECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS FUNCTIONAL ADAPTATIONS	South America was isolated from other continents during most of the Cenozoic, developing a singular mammalian fauna. In contrast to North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, up to the late Neogene, the carnivore adaptive zone in South America was populated by crocodiles (Sebecidae), large snakes (Madtsoiidae), large birds (Phorusrhacidae), and metatherian mammals (Sparassodonta). Sparassodonta were varied and comprised a wide range of body masses (a parts per thousand 2-50 kg) and food habits. Their diversity Decemberreased towards the late Miocene (Huayquerian Stage/Age) and the group became extinct in the middle Pliocene (a parts per thousand 3 Ma, Chapadmalalan Stage/Age). Several authors have suggested that the cause of this Decemberline and extinction was the ingression of carnivorans to South America (about 6-7 Ma ago), because they competed with the Sparassodonta although this hypothesis has been criticized in recent years. With the intention of testing the hypothesis of competitive displacement, we review the fossil record of South American Sparassodonta and Carnivora, collect data about diversity, estimate size and diet, and determine first and last appearances. The diversity of Sparassodonta is low relative to that of Carnivora throughout the Cenozoic with the early Miocene (Santacrucian Stage/Age) showing the greatest diversity with 11 species. In the late Miocene-middle Pliocene (Huayquerian Stage/Age), the fossil record shows overlap of groups, and the Sparassodonta's richness curve begins to Decemberline with the first record of Carnivora. Despite this overlap, carnivorans diversity ranged from four or fewer species in the late Miocene-Pliocene to a peak of around 20 species in the early Pleistocene (Ensenadan Stage/Age). Carnivora was initially represented by small-sized, omnivorous species, with large omnivores first appearing in the Chapadmalalan Stage/Age. Over this period, Sparassodonta was represented by large and small hypercarnivores and a single large omnivorous species. From this review of the fossil record, it is suggested that factors other than competitive displacement may have caused the extinction of the Sparassodonta.

A taphonomic approach and techno-economic comparison of Early Baradostian assemblages from Warwasi and Yafteh (Iran)	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION	Aurignacian Baradostian Mousterian Warwasi Yafteh Zagros	MODERN HUMAN-BEHAVIOR SOUTHERN CAUCASUS MODERN HUMANS AURIGNACIAN CAVE EUROPE ORIGIN ARCHAEOLOGY MIDDLE	Southwest Asia is a key region in current debates surrounding the appearance of the first cultures attributed to anatomically modern humans, particularly the Aurignacian and preceding cultural units of the Iranian Zagros, Levant, and the Balkans (Baradostian, AhMarchien, Kozarnikien, etc.). The Zagros mountain range encompasses an immense territory that remains understudied with regard to the Upper Paleolithic as well as the first bladelet industries traditionally presumed to be the work of anatomically modern humans. Concerning the emergence of the Aurignacian, the sites of Warwasi rockshelter and Yafteh cave in the central Zagros are considered to show evidence of in situ evolution of the Upper Paleolithic from the local Mousterian. This hypothesis is tested by way of a taphonomic, techno-typological and economic approach applied to the Upper Paleolithic levels of Warwasi (spits LL-AA) and Yafteh (the series from the lower part of the sequence). A comparison of the techno-economic features of both assemblages demonstrates a conceptual bond with contemporaneous techno-complexes from Levant and Europe (AhMarchian, Protoaurignacian, etc.). The techno-typological Middle Paleolithic character of the Warwasi lithic assemblage permits a discussion of a possible in situ dependence/continuum from the Mousterian or perhaps particular activities linked to the type of the occupation of the site. However, bladelet technology cannot be considered as rooted in the Zagros Mousterian. Consequently the origin of the Aurignacian sensu stricto has to be reconsidered. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

They are basal taxa in the trechnotherian clade that includes modern Marchsupials and placentals. Therefore, fossils of spalacotheroids can provide information on the ancestral condition from which Marchsupials and placentals likely have evolved. Here, we describe the postcranial skeleton of Akidolestes cifellii, a spalacotheroid species from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation of northeastern China. Our comparison of the skeletal features of Akidolestes and the closely related Zhangheotherium and Maotherium indicates some major morphological and functional differences in the postcranium among these spalacotheroid mammals. Akidolestes shows characters for terrestrial habitat preference. Overall it appears to be a generalized terrestrial mammal. Akidolestes differs from Zhangheotherium and Maotherium in some characteristics of the scapula, the pelvis, and the hind limb, some of which can be directly correlated with different locomotor capabilities, and possibly also habitat preferences. This suggests that a greater ecomorphological differentiation occurred in these stem therian mammals than previously thought and that ecological differentiation is a major pattern in early therian mammal evolution.

Using the 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencer, we assembled and annotated the first reference transcriptome (from roots and leaves) for two related hexaploid Spartina species that hybridize in Western Europe, the East American invasive Spartina alterniflora and the Euro-African S. Marchitima. The de Novembero read assembly generated 38 478 consensus sequences and 99% found an annotation using Poaceae databases, representing a total of 16 753 non-redundant genes. Spartina expressed sequence tags were mapped onto the Sorghum bicolor genome, where they were distributed among the subtelomeric arms of the 10 S. bicolor chromosomes, with high gene density correlation. Normalization of the complementary DNA library improved the number of annotated genes. Ecologically relevant genes were identified among GO biological function categories in salt and heavy metal stress response, C4 photosynthesis and in lignin and cellulose metabolism. Expression of some of these genes had been found to be altered by hybridization and genome duplication in a previous microarray-based study in Spartina. As these species are hexaploid, up to three duplicated homoeologs may be expected per locus. When analyzing sequence polymorphism at four different loci in S. Marchitima and S. alterniflora, we found up to four haplotypes per locus, suggesting the presence of two expressed homoeologous sequences with one or two allelic variants each. This reference transcriptome will allow analysis of specific Spartina genes of ecological or evolutionary interest, estimation of homoeologous gene expression variation using RNA-seq and further gene expression evolution analyses in natural populations.

One key hypothesis has been that abundance Decemberlines with geographical distance from the range centre, but tests of this idea have shown that the effect may occur indeed only in a minority of cases. We explore an alternative hypothesis: that species' abundances Decemberline with distance from the centroid of the species' habitable conditions in environmental space (the ecological niche). We demonstrate consistent negative abundance-ecological distance relationships across all 11 species analysed (turtles to wolves), and that relationships in environmental space are consistently stronger than relationships in geographical space.

Yet lighting conditions also vary diurnally, and many aspects of visual systems and behaviour vary over this time scale. Here, we use the bluefin killifish (Lucania goodei) to compare how diurnal variation and habitat variation (clear versus tannin-stained water) affect opsin expression and the preference to peck at different-coloured objects. Opsin expression was generally lowest at midnight and dawn, and highest at midday and dusk, and this diurnal variation was many times greater than variation between habitats. Pecking preference was affected by both diurnal and habitat variation but did not correlate with opsin expression. Rather, pecking preference matched lighting conditions, with higher preferences for blue at noon and for red at dawn/dusk, when these wavelengths are comparatively scarce. Similarly, blue pecking preference was higher in tannin-stained water where blue wavelengths are reduced. In conclusion, L. goodei exhibits strong diurnal cycles of opsin expression, but these are not tightly correlated with light intensity or colour. Temporally variable pecking preferences probably result from lighting environment rather than from opsin production. These results may have implications for the colour pattern diversity observed in these fish.

Trade-offs across heterogeneous environments can promote diversity by preventing competitive exclusion. However, the importance of trade-offs in maintaining diversity in natural microbial assemblages is unclear, as trade-offs are frequently not detected in artificial evolution experiments. Stressful conditions associated with patches of heavy-metal enriched serpentine soils provide excellent opportunities for examining how heterogeneity may foster genetic diversity. Using a spatially replicated design, we demonstrate that rhizobium bacteria symbiotic with legumes inhabiting contrasting serpentine and nonserpentine soils exhibit a trade-off between a genotype's nickel tolerance and its ability to replicate rapidly. Furthermore, we detected adaptive divergence in rhizobial assemblages across soil type heterogeneity at multiple sites, suggesting that this trade-off may promote the coexistence of phenotypically distinct bacterial lineages. Trade-offs and adaptive divergence may be important factors maintaining the tremendous diversity within natural assemblages of bacteria.

During current range shifts, species are simultaneously confronted with a second major anthropogenic disturbance, landscape fragmentation. Using individual-based models with a shifting climate window, we examine the effect of different rates of climate change on the evolution of dispersal distances through changes in the genetically determined dispersal kernel. Our results demonstrate that the rate of climate change is positively correlated to the evolved dispersal distances although too fast climate change causes the population to crash. When faced with realistic rates of climate change, greater dispersal distances evolve than those required for the population to keep track of the climate, thereby maximizing population size. Importantly, the greater dispersal distances that evolve when climate change is more rapid, induce evolutionary rescue by facilitating the population in crossing large gaps in the landscape. This could ensure population persistence in case of range shifting in fragmented landscapes. Furthermore, we highlight problems in using invasion speed as a proxy for potential range shifting abilities under climate change.

On island archipelagos where colonizations and extinctions are common, it is often difficult to Septemberarate whether similar traits are a result of in situ diversification or independent colonization without a phylogeny. Here, we use one of Hawaii's most ecologically diverse and explosive endemic species radiations, the Hawaiian fancy case caterpillar genus Hyposmocoma, to test whether in situ diversification resulted in convergence. Specifically, we examine whether similar species utilizing similar microhabitats independently developed largely congruent larval case phenotypes in lineages that are in comparable, but isolated environments. Larvae of these moths are found on all Hawaiian Islands and are characterized by an extraordinary array of ecomorphs and larval case morphology. We focus on the purse cases', a group that is largely specialized for living within rotting wood. Purse cases were considered a monophyletic group, because morphological, behavioural and ecological traits appeared to be shared among all members. We constructed a phylogeny based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences from 38 Hyposmocoma species, including all 14 purse case species and 24 of non-purse case congeners. Divergence time estimation suggests that purse case lineages evolved independently within dead wood and developed nearly identical case morphology twice: once on the distant Northwest Hawaiian Islands between 15.5 and 9Ma and once on the younger main Hawaiian Islands around 3.0Ma. Multiple ecomorphs are usually found on each island, and the ancestral ecomorph of Hyposmocoma appears to have lived on tree bark. Unlike most endemic Hawaiian radiations that follow a clear stepwise progression of colonization, purse case Hyposmocoma do not follow a pattern of colonization from older to younger island. We postulate that the diversity of microhabitats and selection from parasitism/predation from endemic predators may have shaped case architecture in this extraordinary endemic radiation of Hawaiian insects.

Elucidating the mechanisms governing differential fertilization success is a fundamental question of sperm competition. Both sperm and nonsperm ejaculate components can influence sperm competition outcomes. Here, we investigate the role of a nonsemen copulatory fluid in sperm competition. Male Japanese quail possess a gland that makes meringue-like foam. Males produce and store foam independent of sperm and seminal fluid, yet transfer foam to females during copulation. We tested whether foam influenced the outcome of sperm competition by varying foam state and mating order in competitive matings. We found that the presence of foam from one male Decemberreased the relative fertilization success of a rival, and that foam from a given male increased the probability he obtained any fertilizations. Mating order also affected competitive success. Males mated first fertilized proportionally more eggs in a clutch and had more matings with any fertilizations than subsequent males. We conclude that the function of foam in sperm competition is mediated through the positive interaction of foam with a male's sperm, and we speculate whether the benefit is achieved through improving sperm storage, fertilizing efficiency or retention. Our results suggest males can evolve complex strategies to gain fertilizations at the expense of rivals as foam, a copulatory fluid not required for fertilization, nevertheless, has important effects on reproductive performance under competition.

It has been argued that the level of sperm competition Decemberlines in birds towards the equator. However, to date, sperm competition estimates have been available mainly for avian species inhabiting the northern temperate zone. Here we apply a Novemberel approach, using the coefficient of between-male variation (CVbm) in sperm size as an index for sperm competition risk, in a comparative analysis of 31 Afrotropical and 99 northern temperate zone passerine species. We found no difference in sperm competition risk between the two groups, nor any relationship with migration distance. However, a multivariate model indicated that sperm competition risk was highest in species with a combination of low body mass and few eggs per clutch. The effect of clutch size was most pronounced in tropical species, which indicates that sperm competition risk in tropical and temperate species is differently associated with particular life-history traits. Although tropical species had lower sperm competition risk than temperate zone species for overlapping clutch sizes, the idea of a generally reduced risk of sperm competition in tropical birds was not supported by our analysis.

Our understanding of the adaptive significance of this diversity, however, remains limited. Determining how variation in sperm structure translates into variation in sperm performance will contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary diversification of sperm form. Here, using data from passerine birds, we test the hypothesis that longer sperm swim faster because they have more available energy. We found that sperm with longer mid-pieces have higher levels of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), but that greater energy reserves do not translate into faster-swimming sperm. Additionally, we found that interspecific variation in sperm ATP concentration is not associated with the level of sperm competition faced by males. Finally, using Bayesian methods, we compared the evolutionary trajectories of sperm morphology and ATP content, and show that both traits have undergone directional evolutionary change. However, in contrast to recent suggestions in other taxa, we show that changes in ATP are unlikely to have preceded changes in morphology in passerine sperm. These results suggest that variable selective pressures are likely to have driven the evolution of sperm traits in different taxa, and highlight fundamental biological differences between taxa with internal and external fertilization, as well as those with and without sperm storage.

Most characterized spidroin genes are incompletely known because of their extreme size (typically > 9 kb) and repetitiveness, limiting understanding of the evolutionary processes that gave rise to their unusual gene architectures. The only complete spidroin genes characterized thus far form the dragline in the Western black widow, LatroDecembertus hesperus. Here, we describe the first complete gene sequence encoding the aciniform spidroin AcSp1, the priMarchy component of spider prey-wrapping fibers. L. hesperus AcSp1 contains a single enormous (similar to 19 kb) exon. The AcSp1 repeat sequence is exceptionally conserved between two widow species (similar to 94% identity) and between widows and distantly related orb-weavers (similar to 30% identity), consistent with a history of strong purifying selection on its amino acid sequence. Furthermore, the 16 repeats (each 371-375 amino acids long) found in black widow AcSp1 are, on average, > 99% identical at the nucleotide level. A combination of stabilizing selection on amino acid sequence, selection on silent sites, and intragenic recombination likely explains the extreme homogenization of AcSp1 repeats. In addition, phylogenetic analyses of spidroin paralogs support a gene duplication event occurring concomitantly with specialization of the aciniform glands and the tubuliform glands, which synthesize egg-case silk. With repeats that are dramatically different in length and amino acid composition from dragline spidroins, our L. hesperus AcSp1 expands the knowledge base for developing silk-based biomimetic technologies.

Inferences about the evolutionary processes that influenced silk genes have largely been made from analyses using distantly related taxa and ancient silk gene duplicates. These studies have relied on comparisons across the conserved non-repetitive terminal regions to determine orthologous and paralogous relationships, as well as the influence of selection on silk genes. While the repetitive region heavily influences silk fiber mechanical properties, few molecular evolutionary analyses have been conducted on this region due to difficulty in determining homology. Here, we sample internal repetitive and carboxy terminal regions from all extant species of the trapdoor spider genus, Aliatypus. Aliatypus spiders are highly dispersal limited and rely on their silk lined burrow for protection. We determine positional homology across species for the carboxy terminal regions and relative positional homology for the internal repetitive regions. Gene trees based on each of these regions are in good agreement with the Aliatypus species tree, which indicates we sampled single spidroin orthologs in each species. In addition, we find that purifying selection and concerted evolution have acted to conserve Aliatypus spidroin internal repetitive regions. In contrast, selection testing identifies evidence of sites that evolved under positive selection and amino acid replacements that result in radical physicochemical changes in the carboxy terminal region. These findings indicate that comparison of spidroin orthologs across a comprehensive sample of congenerics reveal molecular evolutionary patterns obscured from studies using higher-level sampling of silk encoding genes.

Here, we investigate a density dependent dynamic model for the evolution of spite in populations of changing size. We extend the model by introducing a dynamic carrying capacity. Our analysis shows that it is possible for unconditionally spiteful behavior to evolve without population structure in any finite population. In some circumstances spiteful behavior can contribute to its own stability by limiting population growth. We use the model to show that there are differences between spite and altruism, and to refine Hamilton's original argument about the insignificance of spite in the wild. We also discuss the importance of fixing the measure of fitness to classify behaviors as selfish or spiteful.

StAMPP provides an advance on previous similar software packages, due to an ability to calculate pairwise F-ST values along with confidence intervals, Nei's genetic distance and genomic relationship matrixes from data sets of mixed-ploidy level. The software code is designed to efficiently handle analysis of large genotypic data sets that are typically generated by high-throughput genotyping platforms. Population differentiation studies using StAMPP are broadly applicable to studies of molecular ecology and conservation genetics, as well as animal and plant breeding.

Thus, debates persist about the rate, magnitude, and causes of genomic change. This special section is devoted to helping resolve these debates. The eight studies contained within demonstrate how we can begin to move away from vague metaphors toward quantitative and more precise descriptors of patterns of genetic architecture and divergence. However, a particular genomic pattern can often arise via different combinations of various processes such as selection, gene flow, recombination, mutation, genetic drift, and demographic variability. Thus, substantial challenges remain in elucidating which evolutionary processes generated observed genomic patterns. Nonetheless, the studies in this section demonstrate ways forward toward bridging pattern and process, including experimental work, genetic mapping, increased knowledge of natural history and demography, and comparative studies spanning taxa at different points in the speciation continuum. Such collective work will lead to more powerful hypothesis testing. Future work can also help better integrate the contributions of ecology, genome structure (e.g., inversions and translocations), and genetic conflict to genome evolution.

Cepaea is also a pre-eminent model for ecological genetics because the outward colour and banding phenotype is entirely genetically determined, priMarchily by a supergene' of at least five loci. Unfortunately, progress in understanding the evolution and maintenance of the Cepaea polymorphism stalled, partly because of a lack of genetic Marchkers. With a view to re-establish Cepaea as a prominent model of molecular ecology, we made six laboratory crosses of Cepaea nemoralis, five of which segregated for shell ground colour (C) and the presence or absence of bands (B). First, scoring of colour and banding in 323 individuals found no recombination between the C and B loci of the supergene. Second, using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) of two parents and 22 offspring, we identified 44 anonymous Marchkers putatively linked to the colour (C) and banding (B) loci. The genotype of eleven of the most promising RAD-Seq Marchkers was independently validated in the same 22 offspring, then up to a further 146 offspring were genotyped. The closest RAD-Seq Marchkers scored are within 0.6centimorgan (cM) of the C-B supergene linkage group, with the combined loci together forming a 35.8 cM linkage map of Marchkers that flank both sides of the Cepaea C-B supergene.

For almost all such methods, the terminal taxa across the source trees have to be non-nested for the output supertree to make sense. Motivated by Page, the first supertree method for combining rooted source trees where the taxa can be hierarchically nested is called AncestralBuild. In addition to taxa labeling the leaves, this method allows the rooted source trees to have taxa labeling some of the interior nodes at a higher taxonomic level than their descendants (e.g., genera vs. species). However, the utility of AncestralBuild is somewhat restricted as it is mostly intended to Decemberide if a collection of rooted source trees is compatible. If the initial collection is not compatible, then no tree is returned. To overcome this restriction, we introduce here the MultiLevelSupertree (MLS) supertree method whose input is the same as that for AncestralBuild, but which accommodates incompatibilities among rooted source trees using a MinCut-like procedure. We show that MLS has several desirable properties including the preservation of common subtrees among the source trees, the preservation of ancestral relationships whenever they are compatible, as well as running in polynomial time. Furthermore, application to a small test data set (the mammalian carnivore family Phocidae) indicates that the method correctly places nested taxa at different taxonomic levels (reflecting vertical signal), even in cases where the input trees harbor a significant level of conflict between their clades (i.e., in their horizontal signal).

Therefore, surface area-to-volume ratios and the scaling of surface area with volume profoundly influence ecology, physiology, and evolution. The zeroth-order geometric expectation is that surface area scales with body mass or volume as a power law with an exponent of two-thirds, with consequences for surface area-to-volume (SA : V) ratios and constraints on size however, organisms have adaptations for altering the surface area scaling and SA : V ratios of their bodies and structures. The strategies fall into three groups: (1) fractal-like surface convolutions and crinkles (2) classic geometric dissimilitude through elongating, flattening, fattening, and hollowing and (3) internalization of surfaces. Here I develop general quantitative theory to model the spectra of effects of these strategies on SA : V ratios and surface area scaling, from exponents of less than two-thirds to superlinear scaling and mixed-power laws. Applying the theory to cells helps quantitatively evaluate the effects of membrane fractality, shape-shifting, vacuoles, vesicles, and mitochondria on surface area scaling, informing understanding of cell allometry, morphology, and evolution. Analysis of compiled data indicates that through hollowness and surface internalization, eukaryotic phytoplankton increase their effective surface area scaling, attaining near-linear scaling in larger cells. This unifying theory highlights the fundamental role of biological surfaces in metabolism and morphological evolution.

Population genetic analysis is sought to assess the situation of this ecologically and economically important fish species in eastern Australian waters. Here, we report (i) new population genetic Marchkers [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and potential microsatellites], (ii) first estimates of spatial genetic differentiation and (iii) prospective power tests for designing more comprehensive studies. Six DNA samples from three sampling regions (North Queensland, South Queensland and central New South Wales) on the eastern coast of Australia were used to prepare restriction site associated DNA (RAD) tag libraries from genomic DNA digested with EcoRI and MseI. A pooled sample of regional RAD tag libraries was sequenced using the Roche GS-FLX Titanium platform. A total of 172837 raw reads (17.4Mbp) were retrieved, 95500 of which were used to discover 1267 SNPs and 1417 microsatellites. A subset of 161 SNPs was validated based on 63 additional DNA samples genotyped using the Sequenom MassArray (iPLEX Gold chemistry). Altogether 92 SNPs (57%) were confirmed, with 40% of these Marchking fixed variants between northern and southern sampling regions. Our preliminary findings indicate a multispecies fishery stock of M. cephalus in eastern Australian waters, but suggest that strong genetic differentiation occurs north of major fishing grounds. Low potential differentiation within major fishing grounds (e.g. FST=0.0025) can be resolved with a likely power 67% by using standard sample sizes of 50 and validated subsets of available Marchkers.

Strict fidelity has been assumed for the obligate mutualism between Sirex woodwasps and their mutualistic Amylostereum fungi. This assumption has been challenged in North America where the European woodwasp, Sirex nOctoberilio, and its fungal mutualist, Amylostereum areolatum, have recently been introduced. We investigate the specificity of the mutualism between Sirex and Amylostereum species in Canada, where S. nOctoberilio co-infests Pinus with native Sirex nigricornis and its mutualist, Amylostereum chailletii. Using phylogenetic and culture methods, we show that extensive, reciprocal exchange of fungal species and strains is occurring, with 75.3 per cent of S. nigricornis carrying A. areolatum and 3.5 per cent of S. nOctoberilio carrying A. chailletii. These findings show that the apparent specificity of the mutualism between Sirex spp. and their associated Amylostereum spp. is not the result of specific biological mechanisms that maintain symbiont fidelity. Rather, partner switching may be common when shifting geographical distributions driven by ecological or anthropogenic forces bring host and mutualist pairs into sympatry. Such Novemberel associations have potentially profound consequences for fitness and virulence. Symbiont sharing, if it occurs commonly, may represent an important but overlooked mechanism of community change linked to biological invasions.

Here, using light and scanning electron microscopy, we describe the complete life cycle of two species of Theope (Lepidoptera: Riodinidae) that have contrasting ways of life. Theope thestias larvae are facultatively tended by several ant species, whereas Theope pieridoides have obligate symbiotic interactions with Azteca ants that inhabit a myrmecophytic tree. Morphological differences associated with their different degrees of intimacy with tending ants are visible from hatching. In T.thestias, the untended first-instar larva has elongated bifurcated setae and a few tiny perforated cupola organs (PCOs), whereas in T.pieridoides, the ant-tended first instar has short dendritic setae, larger and more numerous PCOs, and functional tentacle nectary organs (TNOs). Throughout ontogeny, T.pieridoides always shows more conspicuous ant-organs than T.thestias, with the exception of balloon setae, which are larger and more numerous in T.thestias. In addition, mature T.pieridoides larvae have an anterior set of ant-organs, including a new type, here described and termed anterior glandular openings (AGOs). Based on the behavioural responses of ants in contact with these structures, a new interpretation for the mechanism whereby Theope larvae can manipulate the behaviour of their tending ants is proposed. Until now, three ecological syndromes can be defined among Theope species: (1) oligophagous larvae with facultative myrmecophily (2) monophagous larvae with obligate myrmecophily and (3) polyphagous larvae with obligate myrmecophily. These results suggest that differences in the degree of specificity in the antplant interactions may have an important role in the evolution of host-plant use in Theope.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London	June 22, 2013The use of digital photography in systematics	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY	colour measurement colour pattern imaging sexual dichromatism species delimitation	ULTRAVIOLET PLUMAGE REFLECTANCE PHYLOGENETIC SPECIES CONCEPT INTEGRATIVE TAXONOMY SEXUAL DICHROMATISM MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA COLOR PATTERNS IMAGE-ANALYSIS EVOLUTION VISION BIRDS	Systematic problems often depend on whether individuals or taxa differ in colour. Recent advances in digital camera technology have made digital photography an attractive method for quickly and easily obtaining objective colour measurements. The present study explores some potential applications for the use of digital photography in systematics. Using an affordable camera apparatus that can take both visible and ultraviolet images, it is found that colour measurements of bird plumage patches are highly repeatable. Calibrated digital images were used to quantify visible and ultraviolet colour in several avian examples, and issues addressed included characterizing the extent of invisible ultraviolet patches, quantifying the degree of colour difference among patches, and testing for cryptic sexual dichromatism. Because the spatial relationships among colours are preserved, colour patterns can be quantified from digital images. As an example, the amount of head spotting is measured along a geographical transect to characterize the shape of a phenotypic cline between two taxa. Another potentially powerful application of digital photography is for species delimitation. Digital images were used to assess colour differences between two putative taxa. Patch measurements were plotted in three-dimensional colour space to determine whether patch colour overlapped between taxa. Four of the five colour patches that were originally described as distinguishing taxa were non-overlapping, and so the taxa were determined to be diagnosable. Digital photography thus provides a potentially powerful method for addressing systematic problems.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 1-13.

Although much is understood about antigen switching at the molecular level, little is known about the cross-scale links between these molecular processes and the larger-scale within and between host population dynamics that they must ultimately drive. Inspired by the antigenic variation system of African trypanosomes, we apply modelling approaches to our expanding understanding of the organization and expression of antigen repertoires, and explore links across these scales. We predict how pathogen population processes are determined by underlying molecular genetics and infer resulting selective pressures on important emergent repertoire traits.

As natural language prose, these data sets are largely refractory to computation and integration with other sources of phenotypic data. By formalizing taxonomic descriptions using ontology-based semantic representation, we aim to increase the reusability and computability of taxonomists' priMarchy data. Here, we present a revision of the ensign wasp (Hymenoptera: Evaniidae) fauna of New Caledonia using this new model for species description. Descriptive matrices, specimen data, and taxonomic nomenclature are gathered in a unified Web-based application, mx, then exported as both traditional taxonomic treatments and semantic statements using the OWL Web Ontology Language. Character:character-state combinations are then annotated following the entity-quality phenotype model, originally developed to represent mutant model organism phenotype data concepts of anatomy are drawn from the Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology and linked to phenotype descriptors from the Phenotypic Quality Ontology. The resulting set of semantic statements is provided in Resource Description Framework format. Applying the model to real data, that is, specimens, taxonomic names, diagnoses, descriptions, and redescriptions, provides us with a foundation to discuss limitations and potential benefits such as automated data integration and reasoner-driven queries. Four species of ensign wasp are now known to occur in New Caledonia: Szepligetella levipetiolata, Szepligetella deercreeki Deans and Miko sp. November., Szepligetella irwini Deans and Miko sp. November., and the nearly cosmopolitan Evania appendigaster. A fifth species, Szepligetella sericea, including Szepligetella impressa, syn. November., has not yet been collected in New Caledonia but can be found on islands throughout the Pacific and so is included in the diagnostic key.

While the developmental pathways leading to caste occurrence are well-known in many species, the evolutionary origin of these pathways is still obscure. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies suggest multiple independent origins of sterile castes in termites, reviving a 30 years old debate. We demonstrate here that diploid sterile castes (true workers) evolved several times independently in this group and that this caste was lost at least once in a lineage with developmentally more flexible workers called pseudergates or false workers. We also infer that flexibility in post-embryonic development was acquired multiple times independently during termite evolution. We suggest that focusing on detailed developmental pathways in phylogenetic analyses is essential for elucidating the origin of caste polyphenism in termites.

The family comprises eight genera: namely, Acanthotetilla Burton, 1959, Amphitethya Lendenfeld, 1907, Cinachyra Sollas, 1886, Cinachyrella Wilson, 1925, Craniella Schmidt, 1870, Fangophilina Schmidt, 1880, Paratetilla Dendy, 1905, and Tetilla Schmidt, 1868. These genera are characterized by few conflicting morphological characters, resulting in an ambiguity of phylogenetic relationships. The phylogeny of tetillid genera was investigated using the coxl, 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA (C1-D2 domains) genes in 88 specimens (8 genera, 28 species). Five clades were identified: (i) Cinachyrella, Paratetilla and Amphitethya species, (ii) Cinachyrella levantinensis, (iii) Tetilla, (iv) Craniella, Cinachyra and Fangophilina and (v) Acanthotetilla. Consequently, the phylogenetic analysis supports the monophyly of Tetilla, a genus lacking any known morphological synapomorphy. Acanthotetilla is also recovered. In contrast, within the first clade, species of the genera Paratetilla and Amphitethya were nested within Cinachyrella. Similarly, within the fourth clade, species of the genera Cinachyra and Fangophilina were nested within Craniella. As previously postulated by taxonomists, the loss of ectodermal specialization (i.e., a cortex) has occurred several times independently. Nevertheless, the presence or absence of a cortex and its features carry a phylogenetic signal. Surprisingly, the common view that assumes close relationships among sponges with porocalices (i.e., surface depressions) is refuted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In spite of this, we do not currently have a consensus on the phylogenetic relationships among the major tetraodontiform lineages, with different morphological and molecular datasets all supporting contrasting relationships. In this paper we present the results of the analysis of tetraodontiform interrelationships based on two mitochondrial and 20 nuclear loci for 40 species of tetraodontiforms (representing all of the 10 currently recognized families), as well as three outgroups. Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses of the concatenated dataset (18,682 nucleotides) strongly support Novemberel relationships among the major tetraodontiform lineages. Our results recover two large clades already found in mitogenomic analyses (although the position of triacanthids differ), while they strongly conflict with hypotheses of tetraodontiform relationships inferred by previous studies based on morphology, as well as studies of higher-level teleost relationships based on nuclear loci, which included multiple tetraodontiform lineages. A parsimony gene-tree, species-tree analysis recovers relationships that are mostly congruent with the analyses of the concatenated dataset, with the significant exception of the position of the pufferfishes + porcupine fishes clade. Our findings suggest that while the phylogenetic placement of some tetraodontiform lineages (triacanthids, molids) remains problematic even after sequencing 22 loci, an overall molecular consensus is beginning to emerge regarding the existence of several major clades. This new hypothesis will require a re-evaluation of the phylogenetic usefulness of several morphological features, such as the fusion of several jaw bones into a parrot-like beak, or the reduction and loss of some of the fins, which may have occurred independently more times than previously thought.

Many of these species often show rapid morphological changes in response to a perturbed environment. The dramatic ecological changes in Lake Victoria during the past three Decemberades, e.g. Nile perch predation and eutrophication, provide a unique opportunity to study environmental effects on cichlid morphology. Preliminary research has revealed that the lake's haplochromines tend to be extremely plastic and sensitive to these environmental changes. So far, long-term ecomorphological studies at short-term intervals are extremely rare. In this study, we examined morphological changes over a 30 year period in six haplochromine species. Geometric morphometric analyses at intervals of approximately 3 years revealed adaptive responses. Three out of four resurgent haplochromines had a smaller head surface/caudal peduncle area (HS/CPA) ratio during the upsurge of the predatory Nile perch. During the same period, all four resurgent species had a larger cheek depth and a smaller eye size. The smaller HS/CPA ratio and larger cheek depth are likely to be adaptive responses to a high predation pressure and a diet shift to larger prey. The smaller eye size seems to be the result of a trade off between the eyes and other morphological structures in the smaller head of these species. Interestingly, the direction of the morphological changes was different between the four resurgent cichlid species and two species that became extremely rare or even may have gone extinct. The HS/CPA ratio increased in the extinct species where it Decemberreased in the resurgent species. This study suggests that predation is a major driver of these morphological changes, which may be due to either phenotypic plasticity or adaptive changes.

In shrimps from the family Lysmatidae, Bauer's historical contingency hypothesis (HCh) suggests that SH evolved in an ancestral tropical species that adopted a symbiotic lifestyle with, e.g., sea anemones and became a specialized fish-cleaner. Restricted mobility of shrimps due to their association with a host, and hence, reduced probability of encountering mating partners, would have favored SH. The HCh is a special case of the TGh. Herein, I examined within a phylogenetic framework whether the TGh/HCh explains the origin of SH in shrimps. A phylogeny of caridean broken-back shrimps in the families Lysmatidae, Barbouriidae, Merguiidae was first developed using nuclear and mitochondrial makers. Complete evidence phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) demonstrated that Lysmatidae + Barbouriidae are monophyletic. In turn, Merguiidae is sister to the Lysmatidae + Barbouriidae. ML and BI ancestral character-state reconstruction in the resulting phylogenetic trees indicated that the ancestral Lysmatidae was either gregarious or lived in small groups and was not symbiotic. Four different evolutionary transitions from a free-living to a symbiotic lifestyle occurred in shrimps. Therefore, the evolution of SH in shrimps cannot be explained by the TGh/HCh reduced probability of encountering mating partners in an ancestral species due to its association with a sessile host did not favor SH in the Lysmatidae. It is proposed that two conditions acting together in the past low male mating opportunities and brooding constraints, might have favored SH in the ancestral Lysmatidae + Barbouridae. Additional studies on the life history and phylogenetics of broken-back shrimps are needed to understand the evolution of SH in the ecologically diverse Caridea. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, many other mammals use their forelimbs to grasp and manipulate objects. Previous investigations have suggested that grasping may be derived from digging behaviour, arboreal locomotion or hunting behaviour. Here, we test the arboreal origin of grasping and investigate whether an arboreal lifestyle could confer a greater grasping ability in musteloid carnivorans. Moreover, we investigate the morphological adaptations related to grasping and the differences between arboreal species with different grasping abilities. We predict that if grasping is derived from an arboreal lifestyle, then the anatomical specializations of the forelimb for arboreality must be similar to those involved in grasping. We further predict that arboreal species with a well-developed manipulation ability will have articulations that facilitate radio-ulnar rotation. We use ancestral character state reconstructions of lifestyle and grasping ability to understand the evolution of both traits. Finally, we use a surface sliding semi-landMarchk approach capable of quantifying the articulations in their full complexity. Our results largely confirm our predictions, demonstrating that musteloids with greater grasping skills differ Marchkedly from others in the shape of their forelimb bones. These analyses further suggest that the evolution of an arboreal lifestyle likely preceded the development of enhanced grasping ability.

The shell inclination of terrestrial gastropods is an appropriate model to address this problem. In this study, we examined how gastropods improve shell angles to well-balanced ones from geometrically constrained shapes. Our geometric analysis and physical analysis showed that constantly coiled shells are constrained from adopting a well-balanced angle the shell angle of such basic shells tends to increase as the spire index (shell height/width) increases, although the optimum angle for stability is 90 degrees for flat shells and 0 degrees for tall shells. Furthermore, we estimated the influences of the geometric rule and the functional demands on actual shells by measuring the shell angles of both resting and active snails. We found that terrestrial gastropods have shell angles that are suited for balance. The growth lines of the shells indicated that this adaptation depends on the deflection of the last whorl: the apertures of flat shells are deflected downward, whereas those of tall shells are deflected upward. Our observations of active snails demonstrated that the animals hold their shells at better balanced angles than inactive snails.

While much is known of the effects of NaCl on anuran tadpoles, less is known of effects on amphibian eggs, or any caudate life stage. In addition, little is known of the effects of MgCl2, which is now the 2nd most commonly used road deicer. Most studies have considered amphibians to be helpless victims of deicing salts, and ignore the possibility of the evolution of local adaptation to this stressor. We attempt to address these knowledge gaps and explore this evolutionary potential by examining the effects of NaCl and MgCl2 on the survival and development of eggs from different female rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa) from the same population. We demonstrate that both salts, at environmentally relevant concentrations, severely affect the embryonic survival and development of this amphibian, but that the effects of the salt are dependent on the identity of the mother. This femalextreatment interaction results in substantial variation in tolerance to road deicing salts among newt families, providing the raw material necessary for natural selection and the evolution of local adaptation in this amphibian.

Here we compare the structure, expression, and phylogeny of the beta ()-keratins in two crocodilian genomes and two avian genomes to gain a better understanding of the evolutionary origin of the feather -keratins. Unlike squamates such as the green anole with 40 -keratins in its genome, the chicken and zebra finch genomes have over 100 -keratin genes in their genomes, while the American alligator has 20 -keratin genes, and the saltwater crocodile has 21 -keratin genes. The crocodilian -keratins are similar to those of birds and these structural proteins have a central filament domain and N- and C-termini, which contribute to the matrix material between the twisted -sheets, which form the 2-3nm filament. Overall the expression of alligator -keratin genes in the integument increases during development. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that a crocodilian -keratin clade forms a monophyletic group with the avian scale and feather -keratins, suggesting that avian scale and feather -keratins along with a subset of crocodilian -keratins evolved from a common ancestral gene/s. Overall, our analyses support the view that the epidermal appendages of basal archosaurs used a diverse array of -keratins, which evolved into crocodilian and avian specific clades. In birds, the scale and feather subfamilies appear to have evolved independently in the avian lineage from a subset of archosaurian claw -keratins. The expansion of the avian specific feather -keratin genes accompanied the diversification of birds and the evolution of feathers. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.) 320B: 393-405, 2013.

However, despite several Decemberades of field research, there is an incomplete understanding of how the polymorphism in ventral plumage colour is maintained and the selective forces involved. Here, we investigate selection on a locus (MC1R) that is strongly associated with plumage colour variation in Arctic skuas using patterns of nucleotide variation and comparison to neutral loci (nuclear introns and mtDNA). We find that three linked nonsynonymous mutations in MC1R, including the single mutation described previously, are associated with plumage colour in the Arctic skua. The position of nonsynonymous mutations on a MC1R haplotype network implies that divergent selection drove the initial evolution of the colour morphs. Comparisons of F(ST)s of MC1R vs. nuclear introns among five skua populations differing in proportion of dark morphs along an approximate north-south cline reveal a signature of divergent selection on MC1R. In contrast, we find limited evidence for balancing selection on MC1R within populations, although the power is low. Our results provide strong evidence for both past and ongoing selection on MC1R, and, by implication, plumage colour in Arctic skuas. The results suggest that a fruitful avenue for future ecological studies will be analysis of selection on morphs in colonies at the extremes along the morph ratio cline.

Therefore, both aridification and glaciation would have considerably influenced the evolution of many mid-latitude species in temperate Asia. Here, we tested this perspective by a phylogeographic study of the mesobuthid scorpions across temperate Asia using one mitochondrial and three nuclear genes. Concordant mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees were obtained, which are consistent with species tree inferred using a Bayesian approach. The age of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all the studied scorpions was estimated to be 12.49Ma (late Middle Miocene) Mesobuthus eupeus diverged from the clade composing Mesobuthus caucasicus and Mesobuthus Marchtensii in early Late Miocene (10.21Ma) M.Marchtensii diverged from M.caucasicus at 5.53Ma in Late Miocene. The estimated MRCA ages of M.Marchtensii and the Chinese lineage of M.eupeus were 2.37 and 0.68Ma, respectively. Central Asia was identified as the ancestral area for the lineage leading to M.Marchtensii and M.caucasicus and the Chinese lineage of M.eupeus. The ancestral habitat of the genus Mesobuthus is likely to have been characterized by an arid environment a shift towards more humid habitat occurred in the MRCA of M.Marchtensii and a lineage of M.caucasicus, finally leading to the adaptation of M.Marchtensii to humid environment. Our data strongly support the idea that the stepwise intensified aridifications from Mid-Miocene onwards drove the diversification of mesobuthid scorpions, and suggest that M.Marchtensii and M.eupeus observed today in China originated from an ancestral lineage distributed in Central Asia. Both the colonization and the ensuing evolution of these species in East Asia appear to have been further moulded by Quaternary glaciations.

In the present work, we describe the occurrence of this sequence, as well the C-banding and karyotype composition, in populations of the group Astyanax fasciatus from Mogi-Gua double dagger u (Araras-SP), Paranapanema (Angatuba and Pilar do Sul-SP), Ribeira de Iguape (Sete Barras-SP) and Tiet (Indaiatuba and Salespolis-SP) river basins. The specimens from Sete Barras (10 M + 20SM + 12ST + 6A) and Araras (8 M + 22SM + 12ST + 6A) have 2n = 48 chromosomes. The samples from Angatuba, Pilar do Sul and Indaiatuba presented 2n = 46 chromosomes (12 M + 20SM + 10ST + 4A). The individuals collected in Salespolis showed three cytotypes, bearing 2n = 46 (12 M + 20SM + 10ST + 4A), 2n = 48 (8 M + 22SM + 12ST + 6A) and 2n = 50 (8 M + 16SM + 14ST + 12A). C-banding revealed large heterochromatic blocks at terminal chromosomal regions in all populations and/or cytotypes. All analyzed populations have conspicuous blocks carrying the As-51 satellite DNA, although the number of chromosomes bearing this repetitive sequence was variable among them. Such differences were not related to the diploid number of individuals, but rather to a biogeographic pattern. Aspects of the karyotype evolution and distribution of this sequence in distinct populations are discussed.

In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Healy etal. () make a great leap forward by describing and identifying asexual, anamorphic structures that produce mitotic spores in many ectomycorrhiza-forming truffle and nontruffle species on soil surfaces worldwide (Fig.). Although such anamorphic forms have been reported sporadically from certain ectomycorrhizal and sAprilotrophic Pezizomycetes (e.g. Warcup ), Healy etal. () demonstrate that these terricolous asexual forms are both taxonomically and geographically more widespread and, in fact, much more common than previously understood. We anticipate that deeper insight into other substrates, provided by molecular analyses of materials such as dead wood and seeds, is likely to reveal numerous anamorphs of sAprilotrophic and pathogenic Pezizomycetes as well (see Marchek etal. ).

In this study, we provide a unique test of the AC model based on mice from a long-term selection experiment designed to produce divergent levels of BMR. By constructing experimental families with cross-fostered litters, we were able to control for the effect of the mother as well as the type of pup based on the selected lines. We found that mothers with genetically determined high levels of BMR were characterized by higher parental investment capacity, measured as the offspring growth rate. We also found higher food consumption and heavier visceral organs in the females with high BMR. These findings suggested that the high-BMR females have higher energy acquisition abilities. When the effect of the line type of a foster mother was controlled, the pup line type significantly affected the growth rate only in the first week of life, with young from the high-BMR line type growing more rapidly. Our results support the predictions of the AC model.

Sexual harassment is detrimental to female fitness and thus might help maintain sexual populations if male harassment inflicts a harsher cost on parthenogens than on sexual females (asymmetric harassment cost). However, the generality of this concept is now considered doubtful because selective harassment of parthenogens results in loss of mating opportunities for males. Using three mathematical models, I show here that sexual harassment still can impose the asymmetric cost on parthenogens. First, I apply the Lotka-Volterra model to show the degree of asymmetric harassment cost that permits sex to be maintained stably in the population. Second, using adaptive dynamics, I examine whether sexually antagonistic coevolution for sexual harassment, which occurs only in sexual populations, can promote the asymmetric harassment cost. Finally, an individual-based model, which assumes a spatial structure unlike that in the other two, demonstrates that the asymmetric evolution of harassment cost prevents further invasions of parthenogens from different patches into sexual lineages these mechanisms may account for allopatric distributions of sexual and parthenogenetic lineages as well as the maintenance of sex.

Here we show that the spermatozoa of the two species have similar ultrastructure and gross morphology. Thus, the unusual and supposedly neotenous sperm morphology previously described for the Eurasian bullfinch appears to be an ancestral trait that evolved before the two taxa diverged. In addition, the coefficients of variation in total sperm length, both within and among males, were high in both species and exceed any previously published values for free-living passerines. Such high sperm-size variation is typically found in species with relaxed sperm competition. However, the high variance in mean sperm length among Azores bullfinches is surprising, because the trait has high heritability and this small, insular population shows clear signs of reduced genetic diversity at neutral loci. A possible explanation for this apparent contradiction is that the Azores bullfinch has retained more diversity at functional and fitness-related loci than at more neutral parts of the genome. Finally, we also present data on relative testis size and sperm swimming speed for the Eurasian bullfinch, and discuss the hypothesis that the small and putatively neotenous sperm in bullfinches has evolved in response to lack of sperm competition.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 108, 677-687.

Whether such differences are result from genetic divergence between urban and rural populations, or from plasticity or cultural evolution of song remains poorly understood. Silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis) show evidence of acoustic adaptation to urban noise, modifying both their songs and calls in cities when compared to rural areas. We investigated whether these differences were associated with corresponding morphological and neutral genetic differences. Across six pairs of geographically Septemberarate urban and rural populations, all morphological traits measured were similar. Furthermore, genetic analyses of variation at nine microsatellite loci revealed high levels of genetic connectivity between populations, and similar levels of heterozygosity in both habitat types. Consistent directional shifts in song attributes of city birds across large geographic areas thus do not appear to be accompanied by associated morphological or neutral genetic divergence.

We addressed this issue in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, a highly successful model system in cell and molecular biology. We found that this species has a distribution that is restricted to the Eastern United States, with high diversity in the northeast and low diversity across the rest of its distribution. We find high levels of population subdivision, low rates of migration and significant isolation by distance, supporting the moderate endemicity model of protist biogeography. This restricted gene flow may be a result of small population size, which would reduce the probability of migration events, or the inability to establish after migration. This work lays the foundation for T. thermophila to become a valuable model system for studying population biology.

However, phylogenetic studies have provided other classifications, highlighting the need for analyses in order to characterize the genome of different species from this family. In this sense, the present work aimed to determine nuclear 2C-value and base composition, characterize the chromosomes and establish the karyogram of Pitcairnia flammea. Flow cytometry yielded 2C = 1.44 pg, AT = 64.28 % and GC = 35.72 % for this species, indicating its relatively small genome size. Despite reduced length and morphological similarity of the chromosomes, P. flammea metaphases presented well-spread chromosomes, with well-defined priMarchy constriction, without chromatin damage and cytoplasmic background. These aspects allowed morphometric chromosomal characterization and assembly of the first karyogram of a Bromeliaceae species. The karyogram displayed 2n = 50 chromosomes, of which all were submetacentric. Karyomorphological analysis revealed grouped pairs of cytogenetically identical chromosomes (2-3, 4-5, 6-9, 10-17, 18-19, 20-23 and 24-25), plus one isolated chromosome (1), not identical to any other. This result suggests an allopolyploid origin for the P. flammea genome. Thus, the present investigation contributed with karyotype data for taxonomic and evolutionary aspects of this group.

Using species-level analyses, we show that these are derived conditions both neonatal and adult body mass Decemberreased in a gradual, phyletic manner in parallel across callitrichids, and across cheirogaleids. We identify lineages with particularly rapid Decemberreases and highlight the pygmy Marchmoset, Callithrix pygmaea, as a phenotypic outlier. The life-history traits associated with body-mass reduction in each clade suggest that the convergent evolution of small body size was achieved by changes in different ontogenetic stages. Body-size reduction in callitrichids appears to be almost exclusively due to alterations in prenatal growth rate, whereas body-size reduction in cheirogaleids may have been largely due to reduced duration of growth phases. Finally, we use these results to discuss some of the debates surrounding the evolution of Homo floresiensis and suggest potential parallels between the evolution of H.floresiensis and callitrichids.

Here, we describe major improvements to CGOB. The underlying structure of the database has been changed significantly. Genomic features are now based directly on genome annotations rather than on protein sequences, which allows non-protein features such as centromere locations in Candida albicans and tRNA genes in all species to be included. The data set has been expanded to 13 species, including genomes of pathogens (C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. orthopsilosis), and those of xylose-degrading species with important biotechnological applications (C. tenuis, Scheffersomyces stipitis, and Spathaspora passalidarum). Updated annotations of C. parapsilosis, C. dubliniensis, and Debaryomyces hansenii have been incorporated. We discovered more than 1,500 previously unannotated genes among the 13 genomes, ranging in size from 29 to 3,850 amino acids. Poorly conserved and rapidly evolving genes were also identified. Re-analysis of the mating type loci of the xylose degraders suggests that C. tenuis is heterothallic, whereas both Spa. passalidarum and S. stipitis are homothallic. As well as hosting the browser, the CGOB website (http://cgob.ucd.ie) gives direct access to all the underlying genome annotations, sequences, and curated orthology data.

There are two major types of models for the origin of the code, which explain how this sophisticated structure evolved. Adaptive models state that the primitive code was specifically selected for error minimization, while historic models hypothesize that the robustness of the code is an artifact or by-product of the mechanism of code evolution. In this paper, we evaluated the levels of robustness in existing non-canonical codes as well as codes that differ in only one codon assignment from the standard code. We found that the level of robustness of many of these codes is comparable or better than that of the standard code. Although these results do not preclude an adaptive origin of the genetic code, they suggest that the code was not selected for minimizing the effects of point mutations.

This paper comprises a description and three-dimensional morphometric analysis of new carpals from at least one other individual at Liang Bua attributed to H. floresiensis: a right capitate and two hamates. The new capitate is smaller than that of LB1 but is nearly identical in morphology. As with capitates from extant apes, species of Australopithecus, and LB1, the newly described capitate displays a deeply-excavated nonarticular area along its radial aspect, a scaphoid facet that extends into a J-hook articulation on the neck, and a more radially-oriented second metacarpal facet it also lacks an enlarged palMarchly-positioned trapezoid facet. Because there is no accommodation for the derived, palMarchly blocky trapezoid that characterizes Homo sapiens and Neandertals, this individual most likely had a plesiomorphically wedge-shaped trapezoid (like LB1). Morphometric analyses confirm the close similarity of the new capitate and that of LB1, and are consistent with previous findings of an overall primitive articular geometry. In general, hamate morphology is more conserved across hominins, and the H. floresiensis specimens fall at the far edge of the range of variation for H. sapiens in a number of metrics. However, the hamate of H. floresiensis is exceptionally small and exhibits a relatively long, stout hamulus lacking the oval-shaped cross-section characteristic of human and Neandertal hamuli (variably present in australopiths). Documentation of a second individual with primitive carpal anatomy from Liang Bua, along with further analysis of trapezoid scaling relative to the capitate in LB1, refutes claims that the wrist of the type specimen represents a modern human with pathology. In total, the carpal anatomy of H. floresiensis supports the hypothesis that the lineage leading to the evolution of this species originated prior to the cladogenetic event that gave rise to modern humans and Neandertals.

With the availability of genomic sequences for all hominid genera and other anthropoids, we may have reached the point at which the information from sequence data alone will not provide further evidence for the inference of the hominid evolution timescale. To verify this conjecture, we have compiled a genomic data set for all of the anthropoid genera. Our estimate places the Homo/Pan divergence at approximately 7.4Ma, the Gorilla lineage divergence at approximately 9.7Ma, the basal Hominidae divergence at 18.1Ma and the basal Hominoidea divergence at 20.6Ma. By inferring the theoretical limit distribution of posterior densities under a Bayesian framework, we show that it is unlikely that lengthier alignments or the availability of new genomic sequences will provide additional information to reduce the uncertainty associated with the divergence time estimates of the four hominid genera. A reduction of this uncertainty will be achieved only by the inclusion of more informative calibration priors.

The present phylogeny further allows a more detailed reconstruction of the stepwise evolution of adaptations for drilling, tapping and climbing up head first on vertical surfaces. The last common ancestor of woodpeckers (Picidae) was neither capable of excavating nest cavities by drilling with its beak nor of climbing up tree trunks. First adaptations for drilling such as reinforced rhamphotheca, frontal overhang and proc. dorsalis pterygoidei evolved in the ancestral lineage of piculets (Picumninae) and true woodpeckers (Picinae s.l.). Further adaptations for drilling and tapping are an enlarged condylus lateralis of the quadrate and fused cotylae mediales and laterales of the lower jaw, but these characters evolved in the ancestral lineage of Picinae s. str. and are priMarchily lacking in Hemicircus. The inner rectrix pairs became stiffened, and the lamina pygostyli was enlarged in the ancestral lineage of true woodpeckers (Hemicircus + Picinae s. str.). These features can be regarded as first adaptations for climbing up head first and were retained by Hemicircus. In the ancestral lineage of Picinae s. str., however, the tail feathers became further transformed into a specialized support tail, the discus pygostyli became greatly enlarged, and the ectropodactyl toe arrangement evolved. The last mentioned characters might have been the prerequisites for the enormous increase in body size in different lineages of Picinae s. str., namely Megapicini such as Campephilus and Malarpicini such as Dryocopus and Mulleripicus.

This article examines whether selection pressures operating upon these have led to quite different outcomes or whether priorities common to both have led to parallel solutions. The article also examines selection pressures peculiar to secreted materials. It explores the influence of diet on the biochemistry of the secreted material and the evolutionary consequences for social species of the allocation of the costs of secreting the building material. Conclusions in some of these areas are hindered by a lack of evidence, but this also indicates opportunities for future research.(c) 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 108, 688-701.

However, in islands with intense human activities and unclear geological history, this inference may be inappropriate. Cyprus is such an island, whose geotectonic evolution has not been clarified yet to the desired level for biogeographical reconstructions, leaving the questions of how the Cypriote biota arrived' and does the dispersal have the formative role in patterns of its diversification' unanswered. Here, we address these issues through a reconstruction of the evolutionary history of six herptiles (Ablepharus budaki, Ophisops elegans, Acanthodactylus schreiberi, Telescopus fallax, Pelophylax cf. bedriagae, and Hyla savignyi) by means of mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome b and 16S rRNA), applying a Bayesian phylogenetic, biogeographical, and chronophylogenetic analyses. The phylogeographical analyses show that the colonization history of those species in Cyprus started in the late Miocene and extended into the Pliocene and Pleistocene, with geodispersal, transMarchine dispersal, and human-mediated dispersal having their share in shaping the diversification of Cypriote herptiles. The revealed patterns could be divided into three biogeographical categories: old colonizers that arrived in Cyprus during the late Miocene or early Pliocene either by a land bridge (geodispersal) which connected Cyprus with the mainland or by transMarchine dispersal, younger colonizers that reached the island through transMarchine dispersal from the Middle East, and new settlers that arrived through human-induced (voluntary or not) introductions. This work advances our knowledge of the biogeography of Cyprus and highlights the need to consider both geo- and transMarchine dispersal when dealing with islands whose associations do not have a straightforward interpretation.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 108, 619-635.

Commelinids are supported as monophyletic based on anatomy and molecular data however, relationships among major commelinid groupings conflict among previous studies, representing a long-standing problem in monocot systematics, with major implications for interpretations of character evolution. In more recent analyses, with whole-plastome sampling largely focused on Poales, areas of conflict remain, suggesting the need for closer investigation of relationships and support. Here, we increased sampling of plastomes among non-Poalean commelinid orders to investigate deep nodal support. Analysis of 83 plastid genes recovered relationships as ((A, D) (ZC, P)) with robust support, regardless of reconstruction method (parsimony/likelihood). However, conflict among genes was evident when grouped by genomic region. Cumulative analyses of genes ranked by Decemberreasing numbers of informative characters indicated continued fluctuation in support, even as small genes were added to a nearly complete matrix, contrary to the expected pattern of stabilization in support. Topology tests among major commelinid groups suggested that the data were not powerful enough to reject all alternatives. This study provides clues to the limits of the plastid genome for resolving deep relationships among the commelinid monocots.

Recently, analytical expressions have been derived to predict the evolution of mean fitness, taking into account both inbreeding and purging, which depend on an effective purging coefficient (de). Here, we explore the validity of that predictive approach and assay the strength of purging by estimating de for egg-to-pupae viability (EPV) after a drastic reduction in population size in a recently captured base population of Drosophila melanogaster. For this purpose, we first obtained estimates of the inbreeding depression rate (d) for EPV in the base population, and we found that about 40% was due to segregating recessive lethals. Then, two sets of lines were founded from this base population and were maintained with different effective size throughout the rest of the experiment (N = 6 N = 12), their mean EPV being assayed at different generations. Due to purging, the reductions in mean EPV experienced by these lines were considerably smaller than the corresponding neutral predictions. For the 60% of d attributable to nonlethal deleterious alleles, our results suggest an effective purging coefficient de > 0.02. Similarly, we obtain that de > 0.09 is required to roughly account for purging against the pooled inbreeding depression from lethal and nonlethal deleterious alleles. This implies that purging should be efficient for population sizes of the order of a few tens and larger, but might be inefficient against nonlethal deleterious alleles in smaller populations.

Hearing in cavefishes has not been well explored, and here we show that cavefishes in the family Amblyopsidae are not only blind but have also lost a significant portion of their hearing range. Our results showed that cave and surface amblyopsids shared the same audiogram profile at low frequencies but only surface amblyopsids were able to hear frequencies higher than 800 Hz and up to 2 kHz. We measured ambient noise in aquatic cave and surface habitats and found high intensity peaks near 1 kHz for streams underground, suggesting no adaptive advantage in hearing in those frequencies. In addition, cave amblyopsids had lower hair cell densities compared with their surface relative. These traits may have evolved in response to the loud high-frequency background noise found in subterranean pools and streams. This study represents the first report of auditory regression in a subterranean organism.

Among bees, species of the family Megachilidae are characterized by a particularly high diversity in nest construction behaviour. Many megachilid bees nest in excavated burrows in the ground, others place their brood cells in a variety of above-ground cavities or attach them to the surface of a substrate, and yet others have adopted a kleptoparasitic habit. Evolutionary transitions between the different nesting sites and between conventional nesting and kleptoparasitism in bees are poorly understood. In the present study, we traced the evolution of nesting site selection and kleptoparasitism in the AnnosmiaHoplitis group (Osmiini), which displays an exceptionally high diversity in nesting behaviour. We found that the evolution of nesting behaviour proceeded unidirectionally from nesting in excavated burrows in the ground to nesting in rock depressions and cavities, followed by the colonization of snail shells and insect borings in dead wood or hollow stems. Kleptoparasitism evolved once and the kleptoparasitic species have derived from the same lineage as their hosts.

To examine potential impacts of the extinction on body size evolution (e.g., Lilliput effects) and growth patterns, we investigated cranial sizes and limb bone histology in the therocephalian Moschorhinus kitchingi both before and after the end-Permian extinction, facilitated by analysis of thin-sections of 23 limb bones from an ontogenetic sample of ten individuals across the Permo-Triassic boundary. In general, early subadult Moschorhinus displayed propodial cortices with extensive woven- and parallel-fibered bone (PFB) with dense radial and reticular vascularization and a moderately thickened bone wall with few growth Marchks. The outer cortex of propodials and epipodials showed a transition to PFB and lamellar bone with longitudinally oriented canals in individuals interpreted as late subadults or adults (>80% largest size). Most elements displayed several (3+) growth Marchks, though growth Marchks were more faithfully recorded in the epipodials of Permian individuals. Pearson product-moment correlation tests were performed to examine the relationship between size and robusticity on growth proxies (% cortical vascularity, mean priMarchy osteon diameter), but variation in histomorphology could not be explained by size alone. Variation in body size may be affected by differences in juvenile growth rate and duration, which are highly variable in environmentally stressed extant reptile species. Geologic stage was a more consistent predictor of cortical vascularity. We suggest that Permian and Triassic Moschorhinus exhibited differential rates of early skeletal growth, corroborating the hypothesis that increased environmental variability in the earliest Triassic was associated with rapid growth to a minimum body size requirement and, consequently, shortened developmental times.

MOLECULAR ECOLOGY	approximate Bayesian computation biological invasion Erinaceus europaeus establishment invasion lag New Zealand	APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA SPECIES INVASIONS ERINACEUS-EUROPAEUS MULTIPLE INTRODUCTIONS MICROSATELLITE LOCI EVOLUTION SOFTWARE DIFFERENTIATION INFERENCE	The crucial steps in biological invasions, related to the shaping of genetic architecture and the current evolution of adaptations to a Novemberel environment, usually occur in small populations during the phases of introduction and establishment. However, these processes are difficult to track in nature due to invasion lag, large geographic and temporal scales compared with human observation capabilities, the frequent depletion of genetic variance, admixture and other phenomena. In this study, we compared genetic and historical evidence related to the invasion of the West European hedgehog to New Zealand to infer details about the introduction and establishment. Historical information indicates that the species was initially established on the South Island. A molecular assay of populations from Great Britain and New Zealand using mitochondrial sequences and nuclear microsatellite loci was performed based on a set of analyses including approximate Bayesian computation, a powerful approach for disentangling complex population demographies. According to these analyses, the population of the North Island was most similar to that of the native area and showed greatest reduction in genetic variation caused by founder demography and/or drift. This evidence indicated the location of the establishment phase. The hypothesis was corroborated by data on climate and urbanization. We discuss the contrasting results obtained by the molecular and historical approaches in the light of their different explanatory power and the possible biases influencing the description of particular aspects of invasions, and we advocate the integration of the two types of approaches in invasion biology.

Polyploidy has large-scale effects on both genotype and phenotype and has been linked to the evolution of genome size, dioecy, and changes in ecological interactions, such as pollinator visitation. Here, we take a molecular systematics approach to examine the evolution of polyploidy in the plant genus Thalictrum (Ranunculaceae) and test its correlation to changes in genome size, sexual system, and pollination mode. Thalictrum is an ideal study system due to its extensive ploidy range and floral diversity. Phylogenetic analyses were used for character reconstructions, correlation tests, and dating estimates. Our results suggest that polyploidization occurred frequently and recently in the evolution of Thalictrum, mostly within the last 10.6-5.8 My, coinciding with the diversification of particular clades. In spite of an overall trend of genomic downsizing accompanying polyploidy in angiosperms and proportional increases observed at finer scales, our genome size estimates for Thalictrum show no correlation with chromosome number. Instead, we observe genomic expansion in diploids and genomic contraction in polyploids with increased age. Additionally, polyploidy is not correlated with dioecy in Thalictrum therefore, other factors must have influenced the evolution of Septemberarate sexes in this group. A Novemberel finding from our study is the association of polyploidy with shifts to wind pollination, in particular, during a time period of global cooling and mountain uplift in the Americas.

However, this objective is often impeded for many lineages of interest by limitations in taxonomic sampling, genomic resources, or functional genetic methods. In order to investigate the evolution of appendage morphology within Chelicerata, the putative sister group of the remaining arthropods, we developed an RNA interference (RNAi) protocol for the harvestman Phalangium opilio. We silenced the leg gap genes Distal-less (Dll) and dachshund (dac) in the harvestman via zygotic injections of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and used in situ hybridization to confirm RNAi efficacy. Consistent with the conserved roles of these genes in patterning the proximo-distal axis of arthropod appendages, we observed that embryos injected with Dll dsRNA lacked distal parts of appendages and appendage-like structures, such as the labrum, the chelicerae, the pedipalps, and the walking legs, whereas embryos injected with dac dsRNA lacked the medial podomeres femur and patella in the pedipalps and walking legs. In addition, we detected a role for these genes in patterning structures that do not occur in well-established chelicerate models (spiders and mites). Dll RNAi additionally results in loss of the preoral chamber, which is formed from pedipalpal and leg coxapophyses, and the ocularium, a dorsal outgrowth bearing the eyes. In one case, we observed that an embryo injected with dac dsRNA lacked the proximal segment of the chelicera, a plesiomorphic podomere that expresses dac in wild-type embryos. This may support the hypothesis that loss of the cheliceral dac domain underlies the transition to the two-segmented chelicera of derived arachnids.

Adaptive features under differential selection that also serve as cues for assortative mating have been referred to as 'magic traits', which can drive ecological speciation. Such traits are expected to exhibit allelic differentiation between closely related species with ongoing gene flow, whereas unlinked neutral traits are expected to be homogenized to a greater degree by introgression. However, recent evidence suggests that interspecific hybridization among Heliconius butterflies may have resulted in adaptive introgression of these very same traits across species boundaries, and in the evolution of new species by homoploid hybrid speciation. The theory and data supporting various aspects of the apparent paradox of 'magic trait' introgression are reviewed, with emphasis on population genomic comparisons of Heliconius melpomene and its close relatives.

However, this potential can only be realized if the phylogenetic relationships of Olivooides can be constrained. The affinities of Olivooides have proved controversial because of the lack of knowledge of the internal anatomy and the limited range of developmental stages known. Here, we describe rare embryonic specimens in which internal anatomical features are preserved. We also present a fuller sequence of fossilized developmental stages of Olivooides, including associated specimens that we interpret as budding ephyrae (juvenile medusae), all of which display a clear pentaradial symmetry. Within the framework of a cnidarian interpretation, the new data serve to pinpoint the phylogenetic position of Olivooides to the scyphozoan stem group. Hypotheses about scalidophoran or echinoderm affinities of Olivooides can be rejected.

Diversification and speciation of cichlids associate with variation in diet and trophic morphologies among other ecological, behavioural and morphological phenotypes (Kocher 2004). Numerous case studies in cichlids reveal a role of developmental plasticity in generating jaw ecomorphs in response to variation in feeding ecology that can facilitate niche exploitation and subsequent diversification (e.g. Meyer 1987). Specifically, genetic divergence among such environmentally induced morphs can occur via reproductive isolation due to divergence in habitat and resource use in combination with genetic assimilation of environmentally induced phenotypes (West-Eberhard 2003 Pfennig etal. 2010). Expansion of this conceptual model has been hampered in part by the limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of plasticity in nonstandard model systems and the associated lack of evidence linking the molecular mechanisms of plasticity to those that generate phenotypic divergence among populations and taxa. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Gunter etal. (2013) identify the transcriptional mechanisms of diet-induced lower pharyngeal jaw (LPJ) plasticity in the cichlid fish Astatoreochromis alluaudi. Natural populations of A.alluaudi exhibit variation in jaw morphology in relation to diet hardness. Among the plastic responses to diet are adjustments to the LPJ ranging from a robust molariform morph in response to a hard diet to a more gracile papilliform morph in response to a soft diet (Fig.1). Gunter and colleagues induced developmental plasticity of the A.alluaudi jaw using diet manipulations and compared LPJ transcriptomic profiles of the resulting morphs. In this foundational work, the authors identify 187 differentially expressed genes that underlie the development and maintenance of diet-induced LPJ morphologies. This list includes a wide range of genes spanning from broad-acting transcription factors to signalling molecules and structural genes. Here, I examine the ontogeny of the molecular response to mechanical strain imposed by diet hardness and discuss the role of the stages of this response in the evolution of plasticity and plasticity-driven diversification.

The move from a terrestrial habitat to a committed aquatic lifestyle engendered wholesale changes in anatomy, physiology, and behavior. The results of this reMarchkable transformation are extant whales that include the largest, biggest brained, fastest swimming, loudest, deepest diving mammals, some of which can detect prey with a sophisticated echolocation system (Odontoceti - toothed whales), and others that batch feed using racks of baleen (Mysticeti - baleen whales). A broad-scale reconstruction of the evolutionary remodeling that culminated in extant cetaceans has not yet been based on integration of genomic and paleontological information. Here, we first place Cetacea relative to extant mammalian diversity, and assess the distribution of support among molecular datasets for relationships within Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates, including Cetacea). We then merge trees derived from three large concatenations of molecular and fossil data to yield a composite hypothesis that encompasses many critical events in the evolutionary history of Cetacea. By combining diverse evidence, we infer a phylogenetic blueprint that outlines the stepwise evolutionary development of modern whales. This hypothesis represents a starting point for more detailed, comprehensive phylogenetic reconstructions in the future, and also highlights the synergistic interaction between modern (genomic) and traditional (morphological + paleontological) approaches that ultimately must be exploited to provide a rich understanding of evolutionary history across the entire tree of Life.

This transition unicellularity/pluricellularity was acquired independently several times (King 2004). The acquisition of multicellularity implies the emergence of cellular cohesion and means of communication, as well as molecular mechanisms enabling the control of morphogenesis and body plan patterning. Some of these molecular tools seem to have predated the acquisition of multicellularity while others are regarded as the acquisition of specific lineages. Morphogenesis consists in the spatial migration of cells or cell layers during embryonic development, metamorphosis, asexual reproduction, growth, and regeneration, resulting in the formation and patterning of a body. In this paper, our aim is to review what is currently known concerning basal metazoans-sponges' morphogenesis from the tissular, cellular, and molecular points of view-and what remains to elucidate. Our review attempts to show that morphogenetic processes found in sponges are as diverse and complex as those found in other animals. In true epithelial sponges (Homoscleromorpha), as well as in others, we find similar cell/layer movements, cellular shape changes involved in major morphogenetic processes such as embryogenesis or larval metamorphosis. Thus, sponges can provide information enabling us to better understand early animal evolution at the molecular level but also at the cell/cell layer level. Indeed, comparison of molecular tools will only be of value if accompanied by functional data and expression studies during morphogenetic processes.

However, the molecular basis underlying the origin and subsequent diversification of the skeletal mineralized matrix is still poorly understood. One efficient way to tackle this issue is to compare the expression, between vertebrate species, of osteoblastic genes coding for bone matrix proteins. In this work, we have focused on the evolution of the network forming collagen family which contains the Col8a1, Col8a2, and Col10a1 genes. Both phylogeny and synteny reveal that these three paralogues are vertebrate-specific and derive from two independent duplications in the vertebrate lineage. To shed light on the evolution of this family, we have analyzed the osteoblastic expression of the network forming collagens in endochondral and intramembraneous skeletal elements of the amphibian Xenopus tropicalis. ReMarchkably, we find that amphibian osteoblasts express Col10a1, a gene strongly expressed in osteoblasts in actinopterygians but not in amniotes. In addition, while Col8a1 is known to be robustly expressed in mammalian osteoblasts, the expression levels of its amphibian orthologue are dramatically reduced. Our work reveals that while a skeletal expression of network forming collagen members is widespread throughout vertebrates, osteoblasts from divergent vertebrate lineages express different combinations of network forming collagen paralogues.

This event, produced by worldwide cooling and regression of seas, reshaped the faunal composition of Europe and resulted in the extinction of numerous ectothermic taxa. We describe a new palaeobatrachid frog from the early Oligocene of Suceag 1 (Rupelian: MP 2324), Romania, and assign it to Albionbatrachus, a genus previously known only from the British Isles and thought to have gone extinct during the late Eocene (MP 20). Albionbatrachus oligocenicus sp. November. is established on a distinctive frontoparietal bone, which differs from A. wightensis in a few details, including the morphology of the frontoparietal table and paraoccipital processes. The peculiar sculpture on the frontoparietal bears dense dermal vascularization, which might reflect adaptation to oxygen depleted environments. Two autapomorphic characters of the angulosplenial and ilium in A. oligocenicus sp. November. likely reflect a shift in, respectively, feeding and locomotory behaviours. A phylogenetic analysis of the priMarchily Gondwanan group Xenoanura identifies Albionbatrachus as the sister taxon of Palaeobatrachus, and places these two genera as the sister group of a Septemberarate Pipidae + Avitabatrachus clade. The presence of A. oligocenicus sp. November. in the Oligocene of Central Europe indicates that Albionbatrachus survived the Grande Coupure' and necessitates a revised palaeobiogeographical scenario for the genus. We propose that the geographical distribution of Albionbatrachus before the Grande Coupure' was wider, extending eastwards into Central Europe, and that the Grande Coupure' resulted in the extinction of Albionbatrachus only in the western part of its range. The final extinction of Albionbatrachus might have been associated with Oligocene climatic deterioration and with shrinking of specific aquatic habitats. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:AA35E61B-B563-4D89-9F47-08F61D2C4AC7	June 22, 2013Convergent intron gains in hymenopteran elongation factor-1 alpha	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	eEF1A Elongation factor 1-alpha Hymenoptera Intron evolution Ancestral state reconstruction	ANCESTRAL CHARACTER STATES 3 NUCLEAR GENES PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS SPLICEOSOMAL INTRONS BEES HYMENOPTERA EVOLUTION SEQUENCES PTEROMALIDAE DIVERGENCE COLEOPTERA	The eukaryotic translation elongation factor-1 alpha gene (eEF1A) has been used extensively in higher level phylogenetics of insects and other groups, despite being present in two or more copies in several taxa. Orthology assessment has relied heavily on the position of introns, but the basic assumption of low rates of intron loss and absence of convergent intron gains has not been tested thoroughly. Here, we study the evolution of eEF1A based on a broad sample of taxa in the insect order Hymenoptera. The gene is universally present in two copies - F1 and F2 - both of which apparently originated before the emergence of the order. An elevated ratio of non-synonymous versus synonymous substitutions and differences in rates of amino acid replacements between the copies suggest that they evolve independently, and phylogenetic methods clearly cluster the copies Septemberarately. The F2 copy appears to be ancient it is orthologous with the copy known as F1 in Diptera, and is likely present in most insect orders. The hymenopteran F1 copy, which may or may not be unique to this order, apparently originated through retroposition and was originally intron free. During the evolution of the Hymenoptera, it has successively accumulated introns, at least three of which have appeared at the same position as introns in the F2 copy or in eEF1A copies in other insects. The sites of convergent intron gain are characterized by highly conserved nucleotides that strongly resemble specific intron-associated sequence motifs, so-called proto-splice sites. The significant rate of convergent intron gain renders intron-exon structure unreliable as an indicator of orthology in eEF1A, and probably also in other protein-coding genes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A large number of endemic Ophrys species have recently been described, especially within the Mediterranean Basin, which is one of the major species diversity hotspots. Subtle morphological variation and specific pollinator dependence are the two main perceptible criteria for describing numerous endemic taxa. However, the degree to which endemics differ genetically remains a challenging question. Additionally, knowledge regarding the factors underlying the emergence of such endemic entities is limited. To achieve new insights regarding speciation processes in Ophrys, we have investigated species boundaries in the Fly Orchid group (Ophrys insectifera sensu lato) by examining morphological, ecological and genetic evidence. Classically, authors have recognized one widespread taxon (O.insectifera) and two endemics (O. aymoninii from France and O.subinsectifera from Spain). Our research has identified clear morphological and ecological factors segregating among these taxa however, genetic differences were more ambiguous. Insights from cpDNA sequencing and amplified fragment length polymorphisms genotyping indicated a recent diversification in the three extant Fly Orchid species, which may have been further obscured by active migration and admixture across the European continent. Our genetic results still indicate weak but noticeable phylogeographic clustering that partially correlates with the described species. Particularly, we report several isolated haplotypes and genetic clusters in central and southeastern Europe. With regard to the morphological, ecological and genetic aspects, we discuss the endemism status within the Fly Orchid group from evolutionary, taxonomical and conservation perspectives.

A solid amount of organismal data give what some feel is a clear answer (e.g. Placozoa are at the base of the metazoan tree of life (ToL)), but a diversity of modern molecular data gives almost as many answers as there are exemplars, and even the largest molecular data sets could not solve the question and sometimes even suggest obvious zoological nonsense. Since the problems involved in this phylogenetic conundrum encompass a wide array of analytical freedom and uncertainty it seems questionable whether a further increase in molecular data (quantity) can solve this classical deep phylogeny problem. This review thus strikes a blow for evaluating quality data (including morphological, molecule morphologies, gene arrangement, and gene loss versus gene gain data) in an appropriate manner.

Using a combination of phenotypic and molecular genetic approaches, we elucidated the relative roles of natural selection and genetic drift in explaining lateral plate number differentiation in threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) across the entire Baltic Sea basin (approximately 392000km(2)). We found that phenotypic differentiation (P-ST=0.213) in plate number exceeded that in neutral Marchkers (F-ST=0.008), suggesting an adaptive basis for the observed differentiation. Because a close correspondence was found between plate phenotype and genotype at a quantitative trait loci (QTL STN381) tightly linked to the gene (Ectodysplasin) underlying plate variation, the evidence for adaptive differentiation was confirmed by comparison of F-ST at the QTL (F-STQ=0.089) with F-ST at neutral Marchker loci. Hence, the results provide a comprehensive demonstration of adaptive phenotypic differentiation in a high-gene-flow Marchine environment with direct, rather than inferred, verification for the genetic basis of this differentiation. In general, the results illustrate the utility of P-ST-F-ST-F-STQ comparisons in uncovering footprints of natural selection and evolution and add to the growing evidence for adaptive genetic differentiation in high-gene-flow Marchine environments, including that of the relatively young Baltic Sea.

An elementary mechanism that allows maintaining diversity is the interplay between dispersal and heterozygote selective disadvantage, which can lead to self-sustainable spatial genetic structures and is central to the stability of hybrid zones. Theoretical studies supporting the importance of this mechanism assume a balanced sex-ratio and a heterozygote disadvantage equally affecting both sexes, despite the multiplicity of empirical evidence that (i) adult sex-ratio is usually biased towards either male or female and that (ii) heterozygote disadvantage often affects a single sex. We expanded the existing theory by weighting the strength of selection against heterozygote according to the biased in sex-ratio and in heterozygote disadvantage. The range of conditions allowing for the maintenance of polymorphism can then either double or vanish. We discuss the implications of such finding for birds, mammals and insects diversity. Finally, we provide simple analytical predictions about the effect of those biased on the width and speed of hybrid zones and on the time for the spread of beneficial mutations through such zones.

For flightless arthropods specializing on patchy habitats, dispersal agents may represent one such critical resource. The Neotropical pseudoscorpion, Semeiochernes armiger, disperses to new habitats by attaching to the giant timber fly, Pantophthalmus tabaninus, as it ecloses from pupal boreholes within Decemberaying Ficus trees. In a study that combined field observations of mating with experimental removal of individuals from a large, pre-dispersal population, our morphometric analyses revealed that S.armiger is among the most highly sexually dimorphic pseudoscorpions known, with males possessing unusual, triangular-shaped pedipalpal chelae (hands) and a male-specific, dimorphic chela peg that exhibits threshold trait expression. Several lines of evidence indicate that extreme sexual dimorphism in S.armiger results from male competition to monopolize pantophthalmid bores as strategic sites for inseminating females on the verge of dispersal. Sexually dimorphic pedipalpal characters were significantly larger in males located in and around pantophthalmid boreholes, compared with males collected at the periphery of the pantophthalmid emergence zone. Removal of pseudoscorpions resulted in a significant Decemberline in pedipalpal size of males associated with pantophthalmid bores, followed by a rebound in size after collected individuals were returned to the tree. Most significantly, field observations of mating indicate that this competition translates into intense selection for exaggerated male traits, with all traits of the sexually dimorphic chelae exhibiting highly significant sexual selection differentials in males.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 108, 509-520.

We investigated the developmental plasticity of male colour ornamentation in Trinidadian guppies in response to two environmental variables that covary in nature: predation risk and food availability. We found that exposure to chemical predator cues delayed the development of pigment-based colour elements, which are conspicuous to visual-oriented predators. Predator cues also reduced the size of colour elements at the time of maturity and caused adult males to be less colourful. To the best of our knowledge, these findings provide the first example of a plastic reduction in the development of a sexually selected male ornament in response to predator cues. The influence of predator cues on ornamentation probably affects individual fitness by reducing conspicuousness to predators, but could reduce attractiveness to females. Reduced food availability during development caused males to delay the development of colour elements and mature later, probably reflecting a physiological constraint, but their coloration at maturity and later in adulthood was largely unaffected, suggesting that variation in food quantity without variation in quality does not contribute to condition dependence of the trait.

These include variation in quantitative phenotypic traits, regulation of gene expression, and differential transmission of particular allelic combinations. Thus, an integrative approach to the speciation process involves identifying the genetic basis of these traits, in order to understand how they are affected by divergent selection in nature and how they ultimately contribute to reproductive isolation. In the Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), dwarf and normal species pairs sympatrically occur in several North American postglacial lakes. The limnetic dwarf whitefish distinguishes from its normal benthic relative by numerous life history, behavioural, morphological and gene expression traits, in relation with the exploitation of distinct ecological niches. Here, we have applied the RAD-Sequencing method to a hybrid backcross family to reconstruct a high-density genetic linkage map and perform QTL mapping in the Lake Whitefish. The 3061cM map encompassed 3438 segregating RAD Marchkers distributed over 40 linkage groups, for an average resolution of 0.89cM. We mapped phenotypic and expression QTL underlying ecologically important traits as well as transmission ratio distortion QTL, and identified genomic regions harbouring clusters of such QTL. A narrow genomic region strongly associated with sex determination was also evidenced. Positional and functional information revealed in this study will be useful in ongoing population genomic studies to illuminate our understanding of the genomic architecture of reproductive isolation between whitefish species pairs.

Life-history theory predicts that long-lived species should invest more resources into maintenance and immunity than short-lived species. Here, we provide further theoretical and empirical support for this hypothesis. First, an analysis of the evolution of the persistence of immune protection in a theoretical framework accounting for maternal transfer of immunity reveals that longer-lived hosts are expected to invest in more persistent intragenerational and transgenerational immune responses. Controlling for phylogenetic structure and for the confounding effect of catabolic activity, we further showed that immunoglobulin half-life and longevity are positively correlated in mammal species. Our study confirms that persistence of immunity has evolved as part of elaborate anti-parasitic defence strategies.

Surprisingly, there is little consensus on how to combine selection pressures (i.e., molecules used in the treatment of pests or pathogens) over space and time to delay or prevent this evolutionary process. By reviewing theoretical models and experimental studies, we show that higher levels of heterogeneity of selection are associated with longer-term sustainability of pest or pathogen control. The combination of molecules usually outcompetes other resistance management strategies, such as Responsive alternation, Periodic application, or Mosaic, because it ensures 'multiple intragenerational killing'. A strategic deployment over space and/or time of several combinations can ensure 'multiple intergenerational killing', further delaying the evolution of resistance.

This paper explores the evolution of social behavior in a finite population using a general n-player game. First, we classify social behaviors in a group of n individuals based on their effects on the actor's and the social partner's payoffs, showing that in general such classification is possible only for a given composition of strategies in the group. Second, we introduce a Novemberel transformation of payoffs in the general n-player game to formulate explicitly the effects of a social behavior on the actor's and the social partners' payoffs. Third, using the transformed payoffs, we derive the conditions for a social behavior to be favored by natural selection in a well-mixed population and in the presence of multilevel selection.

Here, we describe a population-genetic model subject to environmentally-induced epigenetic effects in order to investigate the conditions under which an epigenetically modifiable allele (epiallele) can invade a population insensitive to such cues. Here, epigenetically modifiable individuals have the potential to develop a phenotype that is suitable for their predicted future environment and, provided this prediction is correct, possess a biological advantage compared to their non-modifiable counterpart. However, when individuals experience an environment that 'mismatches' their phenotype, an advantage over unmodifiable individuals may be precluded and instead they experience a Decemberrease in fitness. These epigenetic modifications are then inherited by the next generation which are either epigenetically reset to match their environment or, by resisting environmental cues, maintain their epigenetic status. We found that when environmental cues were common, a severe fitness cost of mismatch between environment and phenotype meant that the disadvantage was too costly and epialleles were less likely to invade. Moreover, for a wide range of parameters, a higher rate of germline epigenetic resetting Decemberreased the likelihood of epiallele invasion. Accordingly, we found that both the frequency of environmental influences and the rate of resetting were central parameters in this system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

With >100 origins of viviparity, squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes) are ideal for addressing this issue. Some evidence from field and laboratory studies supports the cold-climate hypothesis, wherein viviparity provides an advantage in cold environments by allowing mothers to maintain higher temperatures for developing embryos. Surprisingly, the cold-climate hypothesis has not been tested using both climatic data and phylogenetic comparative methods. Here, we investigate the evolution of viviparity in the lizard family Phrynosomatidae using GIS-based environmental data, an extensive phylogeny (117 species), and recently developed comparative methods. We find significant relationships between viviparity and lower temperatures during the warmest (egg-laying) season, strongly supporting the cold-climate hypothesis. ReMarchkably, we also find that viviparity tends to evolve more frequently at tropical latitudes, despite its association with cooler climates. Our results help explain this and two related patterns that seemingly contradict the cold-climate hypothesis: the presence of viviparous species restricted to low-elevation tropical regions and the paucity of viviparous species at high latitudes. Finally, we examine whether viviparous taxa may be at higher risk of extinction from anthropogenic climate change.

Here, we present the first multilocus, species-tree based analyses of the evolutionary relationships, divergence times, and historical biogeography of this clade with data from 10 genes and 6256 bp. We find evidence for a single colonization of the Caribbean from mainland South America in the Oligocene or early Miocene, followed by a radiation throughout the Greater Antilles and Bahamas. These findings support the previous suggestion that Epicrates sensu lato Wagler is paraphyletic with respect to the anacondas (Eunectes Wagler), and hence we restrict Epicrates to the mainland clade and use the available name Chilabothrus Dumeril and Bibron for the West Indian clade. Our results suggest some diversification occurred within island banks, though most species divergence events seem to have occurred in allopatry. We also find evidence for a reMarchkable diversification within the Bahamian archipelago suggesting that the recognition of another Bahamian endemic species C strigilatus is warranted.

The strawberry poison frog (Oophaga pumilio) has diversified into a broad array of colors that span the visible spectrum. The most divergent phenotypes of O. pumilio are restricted to Septemberarate islands in the Bocas del Toro archipelago in western Panama, whereas throughout the majority of its range (from Nicaragua to western Panama) this species exhibits a single red phenotype. During the Holocene, sea-levels increased and changes in climate caused shifts in habitat through time. In the Bocas del Toro archipelago, rising sea-levels isolated previously connected populations in higher elevation habitats (forming islands). In this study we use historic measures of demography, ancestral distribution estimates, spatiotemporally explicit demographic models and genetic simulations to investigate the genetic consequences of the isolation due to sea-level changes and demographic processes mediated by recent climatic fluctuations. We then evaluate the role of these factors in the evolution of color in O. pumilio by measuring and comparing the deep coalescence of a neutrally evolving nuclear gene and a hypothetical autosomal coloration gene. Our results support a major role for recent population expansion and reduced gene flow (from isolation on islands) in the diversification of color across populations.

Most efforts to explain diversification on the island have focused on geographical models of speciation, but recent studies have begun to address the island's accumulation of species through time, although with conflicting results. Prevailing hypotheses for diversification on the island involve either constant diversification rates or scenarios where rates Decemberline through time. Using relative-time-calibrated phylogenies for seven endemic vertebrate clades and a model-fitting framework, I find evidence that diversification rates have Decemberlined through time on Madagascar. I show that diversification rates have clearly Decemberlined throughout the history of each clade, and models invoking diversity-dependent reductions to diversification rates best explain the diversification histories for each clade. These results are consistent with the ecological theory of adaptive radiation, and, coupled with ancillary observations about ecomorphological and life-history evolution, strongly suggest that adaptive radiation was an important formative process for one of the most species-rich regions on the Earth. These results cast the Malagasy biota in a new light and provide macroevolutionary justification for conservation initiatives.

The study of species capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction can elucidate factors important in the evolution of sex. One such species is the ant Cataglyphis cursor, where the queen maximizes the transmission of her genes by producing new queens (gynes) asexually while simultaneously maintaining a genetically diverse workforce via the sexual production of workers. We show that the queen can also produce gynes sexually and may do so to offset the costs of asexual reproduction. We genotyped 235 gynes from 18 colonies and found that half were sexually produced. A few colonies contained both sexually and asexually produced gynes. Although workers in this species can also use thelytoky, we found no evidence of worker production of gynes based on genotypes of 471 workers from the six colonies producing sexual gynes. Gynes are thus mainly, and potentially exclusively, produced by the queen. Simulations of gynes inbreeding level following one to ten generations of automictic thelytoky suggest that the queen switches between or combines thelytoky and sex, which may reduce the costs of inbreeding. This is supported by the relatively small size of inbred gynes in one colony, although we found no relationship between the level of inbreeding and immune parameters. Such facultative use of sex and thelytoky by individual queens contrasts with other known forms of parthenogenesis in ants, which are typically characterized by distinct lineages specializing in one strategy or the other.

However, the unique features of the ZF domains have made it very easy for evolution to tinker with them in a number of different manners, including their combination, variation of their number by unequal crossing-over or tandem duplication and tuning of their affinity for specific DNA sequence motifs through point substitutions. Classical Cys(2)His(2) ZF domains as structurally autonomous motifs arranged in multiple copies are known only in eukaryotes. Nonetheless, a single prokaryotic Cys(2)His(2) ZF domain has been identified in the transcriptional regulator Ros from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and recently characterized. The present work focuses on the evolution of the classical ZF domains with the goal of trying to determine whether eukaryotic ZFs have evolved from the prokaryotic Ros-like proteins. Our results, based on computational and experimental data, indicate that a single insertion of three amino acids in the short loop that Septemberarates the beta-sheet from the alpha-helix of the Ros protein is sufficient to induce a structural transition from a Ros like to an eukaryotic-ZF like structure. This observation provides evidence for a structurally plausible and parsimonious scenario of fold evolution, giving a structural basis to the hypothesis of a horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from bacteria to eukaryotes.

Current models on the evolution of cooperation with incentives mostly assume peer sanctioning, whereby a punisher imposes penalties on freeriders at a cost to itself. It is well known that such costly punishment has two substantial difficulties. First, a rare punishing cooperator barely subverts the asocial society of freeriders, and second, natural selection often eliminates punishing cooperators in the presence of non-punishing cooperators (namely, 'second-order' freeriders). We present a game-theoretical model of social exclusion in which a punishing cooperator can exclude freeriders from benefit sharing. We show that such social exclusion can overcome the above-mentioned difficulties even if it is costly and stochastic.

Instead, only a limited number of freeriders are required to prevent the second-order freeriders from eroding the social immune system.

Reef-corals have Decemberlined globally due to anthropogenic stressors, for example, rising sea-surface temperatures and pollution that often disrupt these symbiotic relationships (known as coral bleaching), exacerbating mass mortality and the spread of disease. This threatens one of the most biodiverse Marchine ecosystems providing habitats to millions of species and supporting an estimated 500 million people globally (Hoegh-Guldberg etal. 2007). Our understanding of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses has improved notably with the recent application of genomic and transcriptomic tools (e.g. Voolstra etal. 2009 Bayer etal. 2012 Davy etal. 2012), but a model system that allows for easy manipulation in a laboratory environment is needed to Decemberipher underlying cellular mechanisms important to the functioning of these symbioses. To this end, the sea anemone Aiptasia, otherwise known as a pest' to aquarium hobbyists, is emerging as such a model system (Schoenberg & Trench 1980 Sunagawa etal. 2009 Lehnert etal. 2012). Aiptasia is easy to grow in culture and, in contrast to its stony relatives, can be maintained aposymbiotically (i.e. dinoflagellate free) with regular feeding. However, we lack basic information on the natural distribution and genetic diversity of these anemones and their endosymbiotic dinoflagellates. These data are essential for placing the significance of this model system into an ecological context. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Thornhill etal. (2013) are the first to present genetic evidence on the global distribution, diversity and population structure of Aiptasia and its associated Symbiodinium spp. By integrating analyses of the host and symbiont, this research concludes that the current Aitpasia taxonomy probably needs revision and that two distinct Aiptasia lineages are prevalent that have probably been spread through human activity. One lineage engages in a specific symbiosis with Symbiodinium minutum throughout the tropics, whereas a second, local Aiptasia sp. population in Florida appears more flexible in partnering with more than one symbiont. The existence of symbiont-specific and symbiont-flexible Aiptasia lineages can greatly complement laboratory-based experiments looking into mechanisms of symbiont selectivity. In a broader context, the study by Thornhill etal. (2013) should inspire more studies to target the natural environment of model systems in a global context targeting all participating member species when establishing ecological and genetic baselines.

Fidelity may contribute to high variance in male reproductive success when it favors attractive mates or may stabilize social interactions if females are faithful to mating sites rather than males. Using 12 years of data on genetic mate choice in the cooperatively lekking lance-tailed manakin (Chiroxiphia lanceolata), I investigated the frequency of fidelity within and between years, whether females were faithful to individual males or to mating sites across years, and whether fidelity favored attractive males. Mate fidelity occurred in 41.7% of 120 between-year comparisons and was observed for 41.1% of 73 individual females that had the opportunity to mate faithfully. Females were not more likely to mate at prior mating sites when previous mates were replaced. Faithful females mated with the same male in up to four consecutive years but were not disproportionately faithful to attractive partners. Mating history influences current mate choice, and fidelity in this lekking system apparently represents active mate choice by females but little consensus in mate choices among faithful females. This study underscores the prevalence of mate fidelity in polygynous mating systems and emphasizes the need to consider the larger context of lifetime reproductive behavior when interpreting patterns of female choice.

Unlike most plant genomes, the bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) B genome has two, rather than just one F3h copy. The paralogous F3h-B2 sequence was isolated by PCR and shown to be transcribed, but its predicted polypeptide differed from the typical F3H sequence at a number of the conserved residues associated with its putative substrate-binding sites. The F3h-B2 promoter region was highly divergent from that of F3h-B1, and the transcriptional profiles of the two genes were distinct. Among a panel of 95 Triticeae accessions, representing 24 species, an F3h-2 copy was only detected within those carrying a B, S, G, or an R genome. Analysis of the coding sequence divergence suggested that a small segmental duplication occurred early in the evolution of the Triticeae tribe. The duplicated F3h copy appears to have acquired a Novemberel function in the progenitor of the closely related B, G, and S genomes, as well as in the R genome. In other Triticeae genomes, the F3h-2 paralog may have been lost following pseudogenization.

Squared change parsimony with random taxon reshuffling and pairwise comparisons reveal that most compactness and size parameters exhibit both phylogenetic and ecological signals. A discriminant analysis produces several inference models, including a ternary model (aquatic, amphibious, terrestrial) that yield the correct lifestyle in 88% of the cases. These models are used to infer the lifestyle of three extinct Permian temnospondyls: Eryops megacephalus, Acheloma dunni, and Trimerorhachis insignis.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 644-655.

We develop and apply an evolutionary conceptualization of the genome, which represents a logical extension of the evolutionary definition of a gene developed by George C. Williams. An evolutionary genome thus represents a set of genetic material, in a lineage, that due to common interests tends to favour the same or similar phenotypes. This conceptualization provides Novemberel perspectives on genome functions, boundaries and evolution, which should help to guide theoretical and empirical genomics research.

We test the idea that the initial fitness of the selected populations in the environment where the cost is estimated is key for interpreting tests of ecological trade-offs. We isolated single clones of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae every similar to 250 generations from replicate experimental lineages that had been selected during 5000 generations in a glucose-limited environment. We then selected these clones in a galactose-limited environment for similar to 120 generations. Finally, we estimated single-clone fitness in both environments, before and after selection on galactose. The pleiotropic effects on glucose of selection on galactose evolved from positive to negative as fitness in glucose increased, providing strong support for the importance of initial fitness for determining the sign and magnitude of pleiotropic effects. This demonstrates that the sign of pleiotropic effects for fitness following adaptation to a new environment can change during long-term adaptation to an original environment. We also found no relationship between the size of the fitness changes in galactose and glucose, such that pleiotropic effects in glucose became relatively smaller as the sizes of direct effects on galactose increased.

All species studied share colleters between the floral parts Septemberals, petals, anthers, and style covered by an ornamented cuticle short epidermal cells with sinuous walls on the abaxial surface of the petals tetrasporangiate anthers with phenolic idioblasts in the epidermis endothecium with spiral thickenings incompletely Septembertate ovary and anatropous, bitegmic ovules. The floral anatomy is useful not only for characterizing the family, but also for delimiting the subfamilies and genera. Septemberals with silica bodies in the epidermal cells mature anther wall composed of epidermis, endothecium, and middle layer absence of phenolic idioblasts in the Septemberals, filaments, and ovary and stylar epidermal cells with thickened external periclinal wall support Rapateoideae. Cephalostemon and Rapatea show a great number of similarities, corroborating their close relationship indicated in the phylogenetic analyses of the family. Monotrema shares few characters with the genera of Rapateoideae, corroborating its placement in Monotremoideae. Stegolepis shows several distinctive characters, probably related to the greater diversity found in this genus.

This review examines bacterial pathogens as objects of forensic comparison, focusing on their nucleic acid sequences as an important aspect of the comparison process. Because of the clonal propagation of most bacterial pathogens, a phylogenetic approach to understanding the diversity and using this understanding to address common forensic questions is explored. As a general phylogenetic framework is now employed in human mitochondrial DNA analysis, we will use the relevant concepts and approaches common in this area to develop this approach further. We also address the impact of the current ease and prevalence of whole-genome DNA sequence analysis in the forensic comparison process. (C) The Willi Hennig Society 2013.

Phylogenetic analysis shows that it is a stem-group holothurian with a combination of characters that help understand how the modern (crown-group) holothurian body plan developed. Echinoids and holothurians have evolved along different paths, by differential growth of the larval- and rudment-derived body regions. PalaeocucuMarchia shows that late stem-group holothurians had a water vascular organization with a single external madreporite and calcified stone canal leading to the aboral end of the peripharyngeal coelom, and five priMarchy radial water vessels that gave rise to tentacle-like tube-feet. This fossil data, in combination with a molecular phylogeny based on 18s-like rRNA gene sequence data, is used to order evolutionary steps in the making of the crown-group holothurian body plan.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 670-681.

The evolutionary studies conducted previously considered the presence of paralog Foxl2 copies only in teleosts. However, to search for possible paralog copies in other groups of vertebrates and ensure that all predicted copies were homolog to the Foxl2 gene, a broad evolutionary analysis was performed, based on the forkhead domain family. A total of 2464 sequences for the forkhead domain were recovered, and subsequently, 64 representative sequences for Foxl2 were used in the evolutionary analysis of this gene. The most important contribution of this study was the discovery of a new subgroup of Foxl2 copies (ortholog to Foxl2B) present in the chondrichthyan Callorhinchus milii, in the coelacanth Latimeria chalumnae, in the avian Taeniopygia guttata and in the Marchsupial Monodelphis domestica. This new scenario indicates a gene duplication event in an ancestor of gnathostomes. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the syntenic regions of both Foxl2 copies, the duplication event was not exclusive to Foxl2. Moreover, the duplicated copy distribution was shown to be complex across vertebrates, especially in tetrapods, and the results strongly support a loss of this copy in eutherian species. Finally, the scenario observed in this study suggests an update for Foxl2 gene nomenclature, extending the actual suggested teleost naming of Foxl2A and Foxl2B to all vertebrate sequences and contributing to the establishment of a new evolutionary context for the Foxl2 gene.

Recently, it has also been argued that oxidative damage may mediate important life-history trade-offs. Here, we use inbred lines of the Decemberorated cricket, Gryllodes sigillatus, to estimate the genetic (co)variance between age-dependent reproductive effort, life span, ageing, oxidative damage, and total antioxidant capacity within and between the sexes. The FRTA predicts that oxidative damage should accumulate with age and negatively correlate with life span. We find that protein oxidation is greater in the shorter lived sex (females) and negatively genetically correlated with life span in both sexes. However, oxidative damage did not accumulate with age in either sex. Previously we have shown antagonistic pleiotropy between the genes for early-life reproductive effort and ageing rate in both sexes, although this was stronger in females. In females, we find that elevated fecundity early in life is associated with greater protein oxidation later in life, which is in turn positively correlated with the rate of ageing. Our results provide mixed support for the FRTA but suggest that oxidative stress may mediate sex-specific life-history strategies in G. sigillatus.

Indeed, a single cut initiates two distinct regenerative processes, foot regeneration on one side and head regeneration on the other side, the latter relying on the rapid formation of a local head organizer. Two aspects are discussed here: the asymmetric cellular remodeling induced by mid-gastric bisection and the signaling events that trigger head organizer formation. In head-regenerating tips (but not in foot ones), a wave of cell death takes place immediately, leading the apoptotic cells to transiently release Wnt3 and activate the beta-catenin pathway in the neighboring cycling cells to push them through mitosis. This process, which mimics the apoptosis-induced compensatory proliferation process Decemberiphered in Drosophila larvae regenerating their discs, likely corresponds to an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, also at work in Xenopus tadpoles regenerating their tail or mice regenerating their skin or liver. How is this process generated in Hydra? Several studies pointed to the necessary activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1-2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways during early head regeneration. Indeed inhibition of ERK 1-2 or knockdown of RSK, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and CREB-binding protein (CBP) prevent injury-induced apoptosis and head regeneration. The current scenario involves an asymmetric activation of the MAPK/CREB pathway to trigger injury-induced apoptosis in the interstitial cells and in the epithelial cells a CREB/CBP-dependent transcriptional activation of early genes essential for head-organizing activity as wnt3, HyBra1, and prdl-a. The question now is how bisection in the rather uniform central region of the polyp can generate this immediately asymmetric signaling.

Evidence from a comparative study of thrushes (Passeriformes: Turdidae)	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH	Juvenal plumage honest signals aggression latitude Turdidae	TITS PARUS-MAJOR CORRELATED EVOLUTION DISCRETE CHARACTERS FEMALE BIRDS MATURATION PASSERINE MALES COLOR GENUS REFLECTANCE	The function and evolution of avian plumage colouration has been the subject of many studies over the past Decemberade, but virtually all of this research has focused on the plumages of sexually mature individuals. The colours and patterns of juvenal plumage, which is worn by altricial songbirds only for the first few months of life, have been the focus of few studies. We develop the idea that distinctive juvenile appearance may be a signal of sexual immaturity, serving to reduce aggression from conspecific adults. We use a comparative phylogenetic approach to test this hypothesis in the thrushes (Family Turdidae). Honest signals of reproductive immaturity should be more valuable when juveniles fledge into environments with aggressive adult conspecifics. Therefore, we predicted that distinctive juvenile appearance would be more likely to evolve in species with extended breeding seasons and high levels of territoriality. Because many tropical bird species exhibit year-round territoriality and elongated breeding seasons, we used breeding latitude as a proxy for these variables. As predicted, distinctive juvenile appearance was significantly correlated with occupancy of tropical latitudes. While alternative explanations cannot be ruled out and more tests of the hypothesis are needed, the observed associations between breeding latitude and distinctiveness of juvenal plumage are consistent with our hypothesis that distinctive juvenal plumage evolved as a signal of sexual immaturity.

For example, key globin proteins that evolved specialized functions in various aspects of oxidative metabolism and oxygen signaling pathways (hemoglobin [Hb], myoglobin [Mb], and cytoglobin [Cygb]) trace their origins to two whole-genome duplication events in the stem lineage of vertebrates. The retention of the proto-Hb and Mb genes in the ancestor of jawed vertebrates permitted a physiological division of labor between the oxygen-carrier function of Hb and the oxygen-storage function of Mb. In the Hb gene lineage, a subsequent tandem gene duplication gave rise to the proto alpha- and beta-globin genes, which permitted the formation of multimeric Hbs composed of unlike subunits (alpha(2)beta(2)). The evolution of this heteromeric quaternary structure was central to the emergence of Hb as a specialized oxygen-transport protein because it provided a mechanism for cooperative oxygen-binding and allosteric regulatory control. Subsequent rounds of duplication and divergence have produced diverse repertoires of alpha- and beta-like globin genes that are ontogenetically regulated such that functionally distinct Hb isoforms are expressed during different stages of prenatal development and postnatal life. In the ancestor of jawless fishes, the proto Mb and Hb genes appear to have been secondarily lost, and the Cygb homolog evolved a specialized respiratory function in blood-oxygen transport. Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses of the vertebrate globin gene superfamily have revealed numerous instances in which paralogous globins have convergently evolved similar expression patterns and/or similar functional specializations in different organismal lineages.

Using a resurrection approach, we provide a direct test for change over time within populations in a species' introduced range, in the Asian shade annual Polygonum cespitosum. We document, over an 11-year period, the evolution of increased reproductive output as well as greater physiological and root-allocational plasticity in response to the more open, sunny conditions found in the North American range in which the species has become invasive. These findings show that extremely rapid adaptive modifications to ecologically-important traits and plastic expression patterns can evolve subsequent to a species' introduction, within populations established in its introduced range. This study is one of the first to directly document evolutionary change in adaptive plasticity. Such rapid evolutionary changes can facilitate the spread of introduced species into Novemberel habitats and hence contribute to their invasive success in a new range. The data also reveal how evolutionary trajectories can differ among populations in ways that can influence invasion dynamics.

Here, we describe the expression pattern of the homologs to otd/otx, six3, pax6 and engrailed in the developing Euperipatoides kanangrensis embryos. Special reference is given to the expression in the protocerebral/ocular region. E. kanangrensis otd is expressed in the posterior part of the protocerebral/ocular segment before, during and after eye invagination. E. kanangrensis otd is also expressed segmentally in the developing ventral nerve cord. The E. kanangrensis six3 is located at the extreme anterior part of the protocerebral/ocular segment and not at the location of the developing eyes. Pax6 is expressed in a broad zone at the posterior part of the protocerebral/ocular segment but only weak expression can be seen at the early onset of eye invagination. In late stages of development, the expression in the eye is upregulated. Pax6 is also expressed in the invaginating hypocerebral organs, thus supporting earlier suggestions that the hypocerebral organs in onychophorans are glands. Pax6 transcripts are also present in the developing ventral nerve cord. The segment polarity gene engrailed is expressed at the dorsal side of the developing eye including only a subset of the cells of the invaginating eye vesicle. We show that engrailed is not expressed in the neuroectoderm of the protocerebral/ocular segment as in the other segments. In addition, we discuss other aspect of otd, six3 and pax6 expression that are relevant to our understanding of evolutionary changes in morphology and function in arthropods.

Genes responsible for the expression of melanin-based color traits are also involved in other important physiological functions such as immunity and metabolism by pleiotropy, suggesting the possibility of multivariate evolution. However, little is known about the relationship between melanin coloration and these functions at the additive genetic level in wild vertebrates. From a multivariate perspective, we simultaneously explored inheritance and selection of melanin coloration, body mass and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-mediated immune response by using long-term data over an 18-year period collected in a wild population of the common kestrel Falco tinnunculus. Pedigree-based quantitative genetic analyses showed negative genetic covariance between melanin-based coloration and body mass in male adults and positive genetic covariance between body mass and PHA-mediated immune response in fledglings as predicted by pleiotropic effects of melanocortin receptor activity. Multiple selection analyses showed an increased fitness in male adults with intermediate phenotypic values for melanin color and body mass. In male fledglings, there was evidence for a disruptive selection on rump gray color, but a stabilizing selection on PHA-mediated immune response. Our results provide an insight into the evolution of multivariate traits genetically related with melanin-based coloration. The differences in multivariate inheritance and selection between male and female kestrels might have resulted in sexual dimorphism in size and color. When pleiotropic effects are present, coloration can evolve through a complex pathway involving correlated response to selection on multivariate traits.

In several eyeless animals, the visual photoreceptor rhodopsin appears to have retained functional amino acid sequences. Hypotheses to explain apparent maintenance of function include weak selection for retention of light-sensing abilities and its pleiotropic roles in circadian rhythms and thermotaxis. In contrast, we show that there has been repeated loss of functional constraint of rhodopsin in amblyopsid cavefishes, as at least three cave lineages have independently accumulated unique loss-of-function mutations over the last 10.3 Mya. Although several cave lineages still possess functional rhodopsin, they exhibit increased rates of nonsynonymous mutations that have greater effect on the structure and function of rhodopsin compared to those in surface lineages. These results indicate that functionality of rhodopsin has been repeatedly lost in amblyopsid cavefishes. The presence of a functional copy of rhodopsin in some cave lineages is likely explained by stochastic accumulation of mutations following recent subterranean colonization.

The following three hypotheses have been invoked to explain this finding: 1) social insects are attacked by fewer pathogens, 2) social insects have effective behavioral or 3) Novemberel molecular mechanisms for combating pathogens. At the molecular level, these hypotheses predict that canonical innate immune pathways experience a relaxation of selective constraint. A recent study of several innate immune genes in ants and bees showed a pattern of accelerated amino acid evolution, which is consistent with either positive selection or a relaxation of constraint. We studied the population genetics of innate immune genes in the honey bee Apis mellifera by partially sequencing 13 genes from the bee's Toll pathway (similar to 10.5 kb) and 20 randomly chosen genes (similar to 16.5 kb) sequenced in 43 diploid workers. Relative to the random gene set, Toll pathway genes had significantly higher levels of amino acid replacement mutations segregating within A. mellifera and fixed between A. mellifera and A. cerana. However, levels of diversity and divergence at synonymous sites did not differ between the two gene sets. Although we detect strong signs of balancing selection on the pathogen recognition gene pgrp-sa, many of the genes in the Toll pathway show signatures of relaxed selective constraint. These results are consistent with the reduced complement of innate immune genes found in social insects and support the hypothesis that some aspect of eusociality renders canonical innate immunity superfluous.

The origin of isochores has been explained via the mechanism of GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC). However, although the isochore structure is Decemberlining in many mammalian genomes, the heterogeneity in GC content is being reinforced in the avian genome. Despite this discrepancy, which remains unexplained, examinations of individual substitution frequencies in mammals and birds are both consistent with the gBGC model of isochore evolution. On the other hand, a negative correlation between substitution and recombination rate found in the chicken genome is inconsistent with the gBGC model. It should therefore be important to consider along with gBGC other consequences of recombination on the origin and fate of mutations, as well as to account for relationships between recombination rate and other genomic features. We therefore developed an analytical model to describe the substitution patterns found in the chicken genome, and further investigated the relationships between substitution patterns and several genomic features in a rigorous statistical framework. Our analysis indicates that GC content itself, either directly or indirectly via interrelations to other genomic features, has an impact on the substitution pattern. Further, we suggest that this phenomenon is particularly visible in avian genomes due to their unusually low rate of chromosomal evolution. Because of this, interrelations between GC content and other genomic features are being reinforced, and are as such more pronounced in avian genomes as compared with other vertebrate genomes with a less stable karyotype.

Didymobulbos (Liliaceae) and its taxonomic implications	PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION	Gagea Liliaceae ITS Karyology Networks Phylogeny Taxonomy trnL-trnF IGS psbA-trnH IGS	SALISB. LILIACEAE INFRAGENERIC CLASSIFICATION CYTOTAXONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE MORPHOLOGICAL DATA BAYESIAN-INFERENCE LLOYDIA LILIACEAE KARYOLOGICAL DATA SPECIES COMPLEX DNA-SEQUENCES ITALIAN FLORA	The genus Gagea Salisb. is the largest amongst Liliaceae, including 50-300 species. This genus can be subdivided into at least 14 sections: among them, there is the species-rich, relatively late-branching monophyletic sect. Didymobulbos. Most of species and putative hybrids within this section were included in this study for a total of about 148 accessions (corresponding to 35 taxa), almost all collected across the Euro-Mediterranean area. Thirty-seven morpho-anatomical and ontogenetic characters were considered, together with the cpDNA (trnL-trnF IGS, psbA-trnH IGS) and nrDNA (ITS region) molecular Marchkers. Bayesian analysis revealed the phylogenetic relationships among Didymobulbos taxa, allowing us to demonstrate new circumscriptions of critical species complexes, such as those of G. chrysantha Schult. & Schult.f., G. dubia A. Terracc. and G. granatellii (Parl.) Parl. Also the prominent role played in this section by reticulate evolution is further highlighted: many taxa, often unexpectedly, are inferred to represent hybrids (31 % of investigated taxa). The division into series cannot be maintained as we found extensive molecular evidence of hybridization between them. A new taxonomic setting for Gagea sect. Didymobulbos is proposed, and five new species are described.

DISPERSAL PATTERNS	The genus Hypericum L (St. John's wort, Hypericaceae) comprises nearly 500 species of shrubs, trees and herbs distributed mainly in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, but also in high-altitude tropical and subtropical areas. Until now, molecular phylogenetic hypotheses on infra-generic relationships have been based solely on the nuclear Marchker ITS. Here, we used a full Bayesian approach to simultaneously reconstruct phylogenetic relationships, divergence times, and patterns of morphological and range evolution in Hypericum, using nuclear (ITS) and plastid DNA sequences (psbA-trnH, trnS-trnG, trnL-trnF) of 186 species representing 33 of the 36 described morphological sections. Consistent with other studies, we found that corrections of the branch length prior helped recover more realistic branch lengths in by-gene partitioned Bayesian analyses, but the effect was also seen within single genes if the overall mutation rate differed considerably among sites or regions. Our study confirms that Hypericum is not monophyletic with the genus Triadenum embedded within, and rejects the traditional infrageneric classification, with many sections being para- or polyphyletic. The small Western Palearctic sections Elodes and Adenotrias are the sister-group of a geographic dichotomy between a mainly New World clade and a large Old World clade. Bayesian reconstruction of morphological character states and range evolution show a complex pattern of morphological plasticity and inter-continental movement within the genus. The ancestors of Hypericum were probably tropical shrubs that migrated from Africa to the Palearctic in the Early Tertiary, concurrent with the expansion of tropical climates in northern latitudes. Global climate cooling from the Mid Tertiary onwards might have promoted adaptation to temperate conditions in some lineages, such as the development of the herbaceous habit or unspecialized corollas.

Recent studies have suggested that it might be a polyphyletic taxon and could be further subdivided. In this study, three protein-coding nuclear genes and one mitochondria( ribosomal gene were used to analyze the phylogenetic relationships among the genera of the Periclimenes complex, includes the genus Periclimenes and 15 related genera, viz. Ancylomenes, Brucecaris, Crinotonia, Cuapetes, Harpiliopsis, Harpilius, Laomenes, Leptomenaeus, Manipontonia, Palaemonella, Periclimenella, Philarius, Phycomenes, Unguicaris and Vir. Based on both independent and combined data analyses, the results support that the genus Periclimenes is a polyphyletic group. Furthermore, the studied Periclimenes species could be divided into several independent groups, and the taxonomic status of P. commensalis, P. brevicarpalis and P. digitalis may need to be reconsidered. Besides, the majority of the related genera of Periclimenes are suggested to be monophyletic. Our analyses also reveal that these genera approximately form two main clades, despite some deep relationships are still obscure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To place future research on these species into an evolutionary framework we present the most comprehensive phylogeny of Scaptomyza to date, based on 5042 bp of DNA sequence data and representatives from 13 of 21 subgenera. We infer strong support for the monophyly of almost all subgenera with exceptions corroborating hypotheses of conflict inferred from previous taxonomic studies. We find evidence that the lineage originated in the Hawaiian Islands and subsequently dispersed to the mainland and other remote oceanic islands. We also identify that many of the unique ecological niches exploited by this lineage (e.g., herbivory, spider predation) arose singly and independently. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recently, it was found for the first time in the province of Quebec, Canada in the locality of St. Amable near Montreal. To date, very few studies have examined the population genetics of this pest. Consequently, there is a lack of knowledge about the genetic structure and evolution of this nematode. In this study, twelve new microsatellite Marchkers were developed in order to explore these questions. These Marchkers were used to genotype fifteen populations originating from different regions of the world, including five from Canada. Within populations, the highest genetic diversity was consistently observed in the populations from Bolivia, the postulated region of origin of the golden nematode, and the lowest in populations from British Columbia (Canada) and New York (USA). The two Quebec populations were very similar to each other and to the population found in Newfoundland, but surprisingly, they were significantly different from three other North American populations including those from New York and British Columbia. Based on our results, we conclude that the golden cyst nematode has been introduced in North America at least twice from distinct regions of the world.

Many plants provide a floral reward to attract a guild of pollinators, and it has been proposed that floral signals of non-rewarding species may converge on those of rewarding species to exploit the relationship of the latter with their pollinators. In the orchid family (Orchidaceae), pollination is almost universally animal-mediated, but a third of species provide no floral reward, which suggests that Decembereptive pollination mechanisms are prevalent. Here, we examine floral colour and shape convergence in Neotropical plant communities, focusing on certain food-Decembereptive Oncidiinae orchids (e. g. Trichocentrum ascendens and Oncidium nebulosum) and rewarding species of Malpighiaceae. We show that the species from these two distantly related families are often more similar in floral colour and shape than expected by chance and propose that a system of multifarious floral mimicry-a form of Batesian mimicry that involves multiple models and is more complex than a simple one model-one mimic system-operates in these orchids. The same mimetic pollination system has evolved at least 14 times within the species-rich Oncidiinae throughout the Neotropics. These results help explain the extraordinary diversification of Neotropical orchids and highlight the complexity of plant-animal interactions.

With trees comprised of larger, older, and globally distributed clades, it is likely that the lability of a binary character will differ significantly among lineages, which could lead to errors in estimating transition rates and the associated inference of ancestral states. Here we develop and implement a new method for identifying different rates of evolution in a binary character along different branches of a phylogeny. We illustrate this approach by exploring the evolution of growth habit in Campanulidae, a flowering plant clade containing some 35,000 species. The distribution of woody versus herbaceous species calls into question the use of traditional models of binary character evolution. The recognition and accommodation of changes in the rate of growth form evolution in different lineages demonstrates, for the first time, a robust picture of growth form evolution across a very large, very old, and very widespread flowering plant clade.

Two species in particular, the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) and the tomato hornworm (Manduca quinquemaculatus) have been researched extensively. Studies across biological fields have referred to these two species as being closely related or even sister species, but the extent to which these two model organisms are related remains largely unknown. We conducted a comprehensive multi-gene phylogenetic analysis of Manduca, based on both an ML and Bayesian framework, which resulted in a monophyletic Manduca but only when two other genera, Dolba and Einyglottis are included. We tentatively conclude that the sister group to Manduca sexta comprises the Caribbean M. afflicta and M. johanni, and the sister lineage to this clade includes M. quinquemaculatus and the Hawaiian M. blackburni. Thus, M. sexta and M. quinquemaculatus are closely related, but are not sister species. Biogeographical analyses reveal an ancestral center of diversification in Central America, and Manduca appears to have subsequently colonized North and South America. Our phylogeny provides an important foundation for comparative studies of two model organisms and their relatives. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The geological history and complex topography of these mountains may have prompted the in situ evolution of many diverse and narrowly endemic species. Despite the importance of the H-D Mountains to biodiversity, many uncertainties remain regarding the timing and tempo of their uplift. One hypothesis is that the Q-T Plateau underwent a final, rapid phase of uplift 8-7 million years ago (Mya) and that the H-D Mountains orogeny was a Septemberarate event occurring 4-3 Mya. To evaluate this hypothesis, we performed phylogenetic, biogeographic, divergence time dating, and diversification rate analyses of the horticulturally important genus Lilium, including Nomocharis. The Lilium-Nomocharis complex is distributed throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere but is most diverse within the H-D Mountains and Q-T Plateau. Our matK and ITS phylogenies support previous studies showing that Nomocharis is nested within Lilium. However, we detected incongruence between the two gene trees which may result from hybridization. Dating analyses performed using the ITS dataset showed that the evolution of major lineages within Lilium-Nomocharis may be temporally coincident with Q-T Plateau uplift occurring 8-7 Mya and H-D Mountains uplift approximately 4-3 Mya. Our analyses of diversification times and rates among Lilium-Nomocharis clades are less conclusive. However, these do suggest high extinction rates among H-D Mountains lineages.

However, this mountain range does not form a uniform barrier because several large river valleys deeply cut into the Himalayas, crossing drainage divides and potentially forming dispersal corridors, particularly for freshwater organisms. In the present study, the effectiveness of these corridors is tested for the first time based on molecular data, using the amphi-Himalayan freshwater gastropod genus Gyraulus as a model group. Based on a broad spatial sampling from the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, phylogenetic analyses were performed using mitochondrial DNA sequence data. The resulting phylogeny shows that northern and southern Himalayan clades are geographically distinct (i.e. they exclusively consist of either northern or southern specimens). This pattern suggests a lack of gene flow across the Himalayas probably at least since the late Pliocene/early Pleistocene. Successful dispersal and/or establishment of gastropods might have been impeded by geographical and ecological features. Instead of direct dispersal across the range, multiple colonizations of regions north and south of the Himalayas from extralimital areas have to be assumed. The Himalayas thus represent a very strong dispersal barrier for freshwater snails, and probably for other taxa as well.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 526-534.

Although the monophyly of hornbills is well established, previous phylogenetic hypotheses were based solely on mtDNA and limited sampling of species diversity. We used parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods to reconstruct relationships among all 61 extant hornbill species, based on nuclear and mtDNA gene sequences extracted largely from historical samples. The resulting phylogenetic trees closely match vocal variation across the family but conflict with current taxonomic treatments. In particular, they highlight a new arrangement for the six major clades of hornbills and reveal that three groups traditionally treated as genera (Tockus, Aceros, Penelopides) are non-monophyletic. In addition, two other genera (Anthracoceros, Ocyceros) were non-monophyletic in the mtDNA gene tree. Our findings resolve some longstanding problems in hornbill systematics, including the placement of 'Penelopides exharatus' (embedded in Aceros) and 'Tockus hartlaubi' (sister to Tropicranus albocristatus). We also confirm that an Asiatic lineage (Berenicornis) is sister to a trio of Afrotropical genera (Tropicranus [including 'Tockus hartlaubil, Ceratogymna, Bycanistes). We present a sumMarchy phylogeny as a robust basis for further studies of hornbill ecology, evolution and historical biogeography. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this study, phylogenies based on the DNA sequences from the internal transcribed spacer region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA ITS), on the DNA sequences of the trnL intron and trnL-F intergenic spacer of chloroplast DNA, and on amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting confirm that M. purpurascens originated through homoploid hybridization between M. sinensis and M. sacchariflorus. Two different types of ITS sequences were identified from almost all plants of M. purpurascens. One type was found to be closely related to M. sinensis and the other to M. sacchariflorus. Miscanthus purpurascens was found to possess many M. sinensis- and M. sacchariflorus-specific AFLP bands but no band specific to itself. Clustering with the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean and principal coordinate analysis based on the AFLP data also demonstrated that M. purpurascens is an approximate intermediate of the two species. In addition, M. purpurascens has the plastid genome of M. sinensis or M. sacchariflorus, suggesting that either species could be its maternal parent. All specimens of M. purpurascens and its coexisting parental species are identified as diploids (2n = 2x = 38). Possible mechanisms of natural hybridization, hybrid status, chloroplast DNA recombination, and evolutionary implications of this hybridization are also discussed.

Yet, despite the many proposed explanations for this diversity in coloration, definitive tests of the role of ecological factors in shaping the evolution of particular colour pattern traits are absent. Patterns such as spots and eyespots (spots surrounded by concentric rings of contrasting colour) have often been assumed to function for predator defence by mimicking predators' enemies' eyes, deflecting attacks or intimidating predators, but the evolutionary processes underlying these functions have never been addressed. Striped body patterns have been suggested to serve for both social communication and predator defence, but the impact of ecological constraints remains unclear. We conducted the first comparative analysis of colour pattern diversity in butterflyfishes (Family: Chaetodontidae), fishes with conspicuous spots, eyespots and wide variation in coloration. Using a dated molecular phylogeny of 95 species (approx. 75% of the family), we tested whether spots and eyespots have evolved characteristics that are consistent with their proposed defensive function and whether the presence of spots and body stripes is linked with species' body length, dietary complexity, habitat diversity or social behaviour. Contrary to our expectations, spots and eyespots appeared relatively recently in butterflyfish evolution and are highly evolutionarily labile, suggesting that they are unlikely to have played an important part in the evolutionary history of the group. Striped body patterns showed correlated evolution with a number of ecological factors including habitat type, sociality and dietary complexity. Our findings question the prevailing view that eyespots are an evolutionary response to predation pressure, providing a valuable counter example to the role of these Marchkings as revealed in other taxa.

Our aim is not to review the most advanced methods for a specific task. Rather, we define several general guidelines to help with methodology choices at different stages of a typical phylogenetic 'pipeline'. We are not able to provide exhaustive citation of a literature that is vast and plentiful, but we point the reader to a set of classical textbooks that reflect the state-of-the-art. We do not wish to appear overly critical of outdated methodology but rather provide some practical guidance on the sort of issues which should be considered. We stress that a reported study should be well-motivated and evaluate a specific hypothesis or scientific question. However, a publishable study should not be merely a compilation of available sequences for a protein family of interest followed by some standard analyses, unless it specifically addresses a scientific hypothesis or question. The rapid pace at which sequence data accumulate quickly outdates such publications. Although clearly, discoveries stemming from data mining, reports of new tools and databases and review papers are also desirable.

ACETYL-COENZYME RAPID EVOLUTION CHLORSULFURON RESISTANCE CARBOXYLASE INHIBITORS INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE GLYPHOSATE RESISTANCE MULTIPLE RESISTANCE CROSS-RESISTANCE POPULATIONS	The interaction between environment and genetic traits under selection is the basis of evolution. In this study, we have investigated the genetic basis of herbicide resistance in a highly characterized initially herbicide-susceptible Lolium rigidum population recurrently selected with low (below recommended label) doses of the herbicide diclofop-methyl. We report the variability in herbicide resistance levels observed in F1 families and the segregation of resistance observed in F2 and back-cross (BC) families. The selected herbicide resistance phenotypic trait(s) appear to be under complex polygenic control. The estimation of the effective minimum number of genes (NE), depending on the herbicide dose used, reveals at least three resistance genes had been enriched. A joint scaling test indicates that an additive-dominance model best explains gene interactions in parental, F1, F2 and BC families. The Mendelian study of six F2 and two BC segregating families confirmed involvement of more than one resistance gene. Cross-pollinated L.rigidum under selection at low herbicide dose can rapidly evolve polygenic broad-spectrum herbicide resistance by quantitative accumulation of additive genes of small effect. This can be minimized by using herbicides at the recommended dose which causes high mortality acting outside the normal range of phenotypic variation for herbicide susceptibility.

It is generally believed that nrDNA conforms to concerted evolution in most eukaryotes however, intraindividua-lintraspecific polymorphisms of this region were reported in various organisms, suggesting a non-concerted evolutionary process. In Ophiocordyceps sinensis, one of the most valuable medicinal fungi, a reMarchkable variation of the ITS region has been revealed. Some highly divergent sequences were thought to represent cryptic species, different species or genotypes in previous studies. To clarify the unusual ITS polymorphisms observed in O. sinensis, specific primers were designed to amplify ITS paralogs from pure cultures of both single-ascospore and tissue isolates in this study. All of the available ITS sequences, including those generated by this group and those in GenBank, were analyzed. Several AT-biased ITS paralogs were classified as pseudogenes based on their nucleotide compositions, secondary structures and minimum free energies of their 5.8S rRNAs, substitution rates, phylogenetic positions and gene expression analyses. Furthermore, ITS pseudogenes were amplified with specific primers from 10 of the 28 strains tested, including eight single-ascospore and two tissue isolates. Divergent ITS paralogs were proved to coexist in individual genomes, suggesting a non-concerted mechanism of evolution in the ITS region of O. sinensis. The hypotheses that divergent ITS paralogs represent cryptic or other species or different genotypes were thus rejected. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Two possible structural conformation models have been proposed for the ITS2 region, the ring model and the hairpin model, and the former has been widely used in many molecular phylogenetic analyses incorporating structural information available to date. To evaluate the validity of this model, in vitro transcribed ITS2 molecules from species representing the three superfamilies of the Calyptratae clade (Diptera: Schizophora), namely Cochliomyia hominivorax, Musca domestica, and Glossina morsitans, were submitted to enzymatic digestion with single- and double-stranded specific nucleases (RNases I, A, T1, and V1). The resulting fragments were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis and digestion sites were mapped in the secondary structure models which were obtained by in silico prediction with further refinement by homology comparisons. The pattern of RNA fragments generated by these RNases show a high degree of correlation to most of the predicted helix-loop regions and structural motifs. Discrepancies to the models can be explained by alternative structural conformation dynamics (in M. domestica and G. morsitans) and by higher-order factors (such as tertiary interactions) that may stabilize thermodynamically unfavored structures (in C. hominivorax).

Intestinal cells are rapidly turned over and need to be replaced. In cnidarians, mitosis of differentiated intestinal cells accounts for much of the replacement in addition, migratory, multipotent stem cells (interstitial cells) contribute to the production of intestinal cells. In other phyla, intestinal cell replacement is solely the function of stem cells entering the gut from the outside (such as in case of the neoblasts of platyhelminths) or intestinal stem cells located within the midgut epithelium (as in both vertebrates or arthropods). We will attempt in the following to review important aspects of midgut stem cells in different animal groups: where are they located, what types of lineages do they produce, and how do they develop. We will start out with a comparative survey of midgut cell types found across the animal kingdom then briefly look at the specification of these cells during embryonic development and finally focus on the stem cells that regenerate midgut cells during adult life. In a number of model systems, including mouse, zebrafish and Drosophila, the molecular pathways controlling intestinal stem cells proliferation and the specification of intestinal cell types are under intensive investigation. We will highlight findings of the recent literature, focusing on aspects that are shared between the different models and that point at evolutionary ancient mechanisms of intestinal cell formation.

In this complex landscape, alternative assumptions of the relative importance of specific habitat characteristics on evolutionary and ecological processes predict strikingly different general patterns of local diversity and regional similarity. In this study, we compare alternative a priori hypotheses against observed patterns within two distinct biological systems and scales: community composition of wet forest vascular plant species and mitochondrial and nuclear genes of Drosophila sproati, a wet-forest-restricted endemic. All observed patterns display strong and similar regional structuring, with the greatest local diversity found in Kohala and the windward side of Mauna Loa, the least in Ka'u and Kona, and a distinctive pattern of regional similarity that probably reflects the historical development of this habitat on the island. These observations largely corroborate a biogeographical model that integrates multiple lines of evidence, including climatic reconstruction, over those relying on single measures, such as current habitat configuration or substrate age. This method of testing alternative hypotheses across biological systems and scales is an inNovemberative approach for understanding complex landscapes and should prove valuable in diverse biogeographical systems.

Here, we explore the evolutionary mechanisms behind the rule in 184 mammal species, testing climatic, ecological and phylogenetic hypotheses in a robust quantitative framework. Our findings confirm the importance of species' ecological traits in determining both the strength and the direction of body size changes on islands. Although the island rule pattern appears relatively weak overall, we find strongest support for models incorporating trait, climatic and geographical factors in a phylogenetic context, lending support to the idea that the island rule is a complex phenomenon driven by interacting intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Overall, we find that different clades may be evolutionarily predisposed to dwarfism or gigantism, but the magnitude of size changes depends more on adaptation to the Novemberel island environment.

In the natural habitat, one-third of Lycoris taxa are interspecific hybrids that are mainly sterile and extremely diverse in morphologies. Lycoris are geophytes with the reproductive stage initiated inside the bulbs during the storage period, which brings some inconveniences in collecting meiotic materials for studying chromosome pairing. The partial fertility of an artificial F1 interspecific hybrid between L. aurea (2n = 14) and L. radiata (2n = 22) provides an alternative option for tracing the meiotic process in F1 hybrids. The chromosome compositions of those functional gametes generated by the F1 hybrid could be recovered according to the chromosome complements of backcross progenies. We perform genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) analysis on somatic chromosomes of 34 BC1 plants (2n = 14-22) to reveal chromosomal divergences in number and composition of those functional gametes. GISH results also indicated a high homology between the MT- and A-genomes of Lycoris, reflecting on the partial fertility and frequently homoeologous recombination at meiosis of the F1 interspecific hybrids. The diverse chromosome complements and recombinant patterns presented in these functional gametes suggested that interspecific hybridization is an important force in driving diversification among Lycoris species. We suggest that the MT-karyotype genome may be the ancestral type in Lycoris, and some other chromosomal rearrangements in addition to centromeric fission may have played roles in the karyotype evolution of Lycoris.

Moreover, most studies have examined long-established laboratory strains rather than freshly cAugustht individuals and may thus be confounded by adaptation to laboratory culture, inbreeding or mutation accumulation. Here, we have followed the life histories of individual females from three recently cAugustht, non-laboratory-adapted wild populations of D.melanogaster. Populations varied in a number of life-history traits, including ovariole number, fecundity, hatchability and lifespan. To describe individual patterns of age-specific fecundity, we developed a new model that allowed us to distinguish four phases during a female's life: a phase of reproductive maturation, followed by a period of linear and then exponential Decemberline in fecundity and, finally, a post-ovipository period. Individual females exhibited clear-cut fecundity peaks, which contrasts with previous analyses, and post-peak levels of fecundity Decemberlined independently of how long females lived. Notably, females had a pronounced post-reproductive lifespan, which on average made up 40% of total lifespan. Post-reproductive lifespan did not differ among populations and was not correlated with reproductive fitness components, supporting the hypothesis that this period is a highly variable, random add-on' at the end of reproductive life rather than a correlate of selection on reproductive fitness. Most life-history traits were positively correlated, a pattern that might be due to genotype by environment interactions when wild flies are brought into a Novemberel laboratory environment but that is unlikely explained by inbreeding or positive mutational covariance caused by mutation accumulation.

Although hermaphrodites can potentially reproduce by self-fertilization, they have a high prevalence of outcrossing. The genetic advantages of outcrossing are described by two hypotheses: avoidance of inbreeding depression because selfing leads to immediate expression of recessive deleterious mutations, and release from drift load because self-fertilization leads to long-term accumulation of deleterious mutations due to genetic drift and, eventually, to extinction. I tested both hypotheses by experimentally crossing Arabidopsis lyrata plants (self-pollinated, cross-pollinated within the population, or cross-pollinated between populations) and measuring offspring performance over 3 years. There were 18 source populations, each of which was either predominantly outcrossing, mixed mating, or predominantly selfing. Contrary to predictions, outcrossing populations had low inbreeding depression, which equaled that of selfing populations, challenging the central role of inbreeding depression in mating system shifts. However, plants from selfing populations showed the greatest increase in fitness when crossed with plants from other populations, reflecting higher drift load. The results support the hypothesis that extinction by mutational meltdown is why selfing hermaphroditic taxa are rare, despite their frequent appearance over evolutionary time.

Taking into account that the bulging of the frontal bone is often described as a species-specific trait of Homo sapiens, in this article we analyze variation in the midsagittal profile of the genus Homo, focusing on the frontal squama alone, using landMarchk-based superimpositions and principal components analysis. Our results demonstrate that anatomically modern humans are definitely Septemberarated from extinct human taxa on the basis of frontal bulging. However, there is minor overlap among these groups, indicating that it is necessary to exercise caution when using this trait alone to make taxonomic inferences on individual specimens. Early modern humans do not show differences with recent modern humans, and transitional individuals such as Jebel Irhoud 1, Maba, and Florisbad, show modern-like frontal squama morphology. The bulging of the frontal squama in modern humans may represent a structural consequence of more general cranial changes, or it could be a response to changes in the morphology of the underlying prefrontal brain elements. A subtle difference between Neandertals and the Afro-European Middle Pleistocene Homo sample is associated with flattening at bregma in the former group, a result that merits further investigation.

They show a restricted distribution in the western Palearctic, where they include few native species, i.e. Rhinotyphlops simoni, R. episcopus and Typhlops vermicularis. A unique species among typhlopids is T. socotranus, found in Socotra, one of the most endemic-rich archipelagoes. In this study we determine the phylogenetic position of the above mentioned species and discuss their systematics, origin and biogeography. For this purpose we use three protein-coding nuclear Marchkers (AMEL-amelogenin, BDNF-brain-derived neurotrophic factor and NT3-neurotrophin 3) to construct a time-calibrated phylogeny of the family Typhlopidae. Our results show that T. socotranus is a sister-species to T. vermicularis, while R. simoni and R. episcopus are sister-species to each other and are found within the African clade of the family, although they are geographically distributed in west Asia. Additionally we discuss several hypotheses on their origin, as well as the occurence of typhlopids in Eurasia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, gene expression breadth and noise can potentially counteract the effect of masking on the rate at which genes evolve. Land plants are ideal to ask whether masking, expression breadth, or expression noise dominate in their influence on the rate of molecular evolution, because they have a biphasic life cycle in which the duration and complexity of the haploid and diploid phase varies among organisms. Here, we generate and compile genome-wide gene expression, sequence divergence, and polymorphism data for Arabidopsis thaliana and for the moss Funaria hygrometrica to show that the evolutionary rates of haploid- and diploid-specific genes contradict the masking hypothesis. Haploid-specific genes do not evolve more slowly than diploid-specific genes in either organism. Our data suggest that gene expression breadth influence the evolutionary rate of phase-specific genes more strongly than masking. Our observations have implications for the role of haploid life stages in the purging of deleterious mutations, as well as for the evolution of ploidy.

This is particularly interesting in Mestizos, which constitute the main population in Mexico (similar to 93%) resulting from post-Columbian admixture between Spaniards, Amerindians, and African slaves, principally. Consequently, we conducted minisequencing analysis (SNaPshot) of 11 mitochondrial single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 742 Mestizos of 10 populations from different regions in Mexico. The predominant maternal ancestry was Native American (92.9%), including Haplogroups A, B, C, and D (47, 23.7, 15.9, and 6.2%, respectively). Conversely, European and African ancestries were less frequent (5.3 and 1.9%, respectively). The main characteristics of the maternal lineages observed in Mexican-Mestizos comprised the following: 1) contrasting geographic gradient of Haplogroups A and C 2) increase of European lineages toward the Northwest 3) low or absent, but homogeneous, African ancestry throughout the Mexican territory 4) maternal lineages in Mestizos roughly represent the genetic makeup of the surrounding Amerindian groups, particularly toward the Southeast, but not in the North and West 5) continuity over time of the geographic distribution of Amerindian lineages in Mayas and 6) low but significant maternal population structure (F-ST = 2.8% P=0.0000). The average ancestry obtained from uniparental systems (mtDNA and Y-chromosome) in Mexican-Mestizos was correlated with previous ancestry estimates based on autosomal systems (genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms and short tandem repeats). Finally, the comparison of paternal and maternal lineages provided additional information concerning the gender bias admixture, mating patterns, and population structure in Mestizos throughout the Mexican territory.

This duolocal residence with 'walking' or 'visiting' Marchriage is described in only a handful of matrilineal peasant societies. Benefits to women of living with matrilineal kin, who cooperate with child-care, are clear. But why any kinship system can evolve where males invest more in their sister's offspring than their own is a puzzle for evolutionary anthropologists. Here, we present a new hypothesis for a matrilineal bias in male investment. We argue that, when household resources are communal, relatedness to the whole household matters more than relatedness to individual offspring. We use an inclusive fitness model to show that the more sisters (and other closely related females) co-reside, the more effort males should spend working on their sister's farm and less on their wife's farm. The model shows that paternity uncertainty may be a cause of lower overall work rates in males, but it is not likely to be the cause of a matrilineal bias. The bias in work effort towards working on their natal farm, and thus the duolocal residence and 'visiting Marchriage' system, can be understood as maximizing inclusive fitness in circumstances where female kin breed communally.

However, researchers can only directly calculate r when adequate time series, life tables and similar datasets are available. We instead view r as an evolvable, synthetic life-history trait and use comparative phylogenetic approaches to predict r for poorly known species. Combining molecular phylogenies, life-history trait data and stochastic macroevolutionary models, we predicted r for mammals of the Caniformia and Cervidae. Cross-validation analyses demonstrated that, even with sparse life-history data, comparative methods estimated r well and outperformed models based on body mass. Values of r predicted via comparative methods were in strong rank agreement with observed values and reduced mean prediction errors by approximately 68 per cent compared with two null models. We demonstrate the utility of our method by estimating r for 102 extant species in these mammal groups with unknown life-history traits.

PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION	Phylogeography Ancestral character state reconstruction Trichomes Ploidy level Mediterranean Asia	MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT BAYESIAN-INFERENCE CHLOROPLAST DNA ARALIACEAE NUCLEAR INSIGHTS CHARACTERS	The Mediterranean harbours the highest number of Hedera (Araliaceae) species, lineages, ploidy levels, and trichome morphologies of any area where the genus occurs. Previous molecular and cytogenetic studies identified two main centres of diversity for Hedera (Araliaceae), the eastern and western parts of the Mediterranean region. An explicit analysis of key traits was performed to investigate geographical patterns and ancestral character states of ivy lineages. Interestingly, the greatest diversity of Hedera was found in the western Mediterranean, including the three species of Macaronesia (H. azorica in the Azores, H. maderensis in Madeira and H. canariensis in the Canary Islands). Phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses of the nrITS and plastid trnT-L sequences revealed multiple connections between the Mediterranean region and Asia, and suggest recurrent colonization between these two areas. Reconstruction of three important characters long used to distinguish members of the genus (trichome types, ploidy levels, and geographical areas) suggests that a diploid species with scale-like trichomes from the Mediterranean basin was the most recent common ancestor of the extant species of Hedera.

These populations have a complex evolutionary history, having descended from 'old' and 'young' ancestral surface-dwelling stocks that invaded the region similar to 6.7 and similar to 2.8 MYa, respectively. This study investigates a set of captive, pigmented Astyanax cavefish collected from the Micos cave locality in 1970, in which albinism appeared over the past two Decemberades. We combined Novemberel coloration analyses, coding sequence comparisons and mRNA expression level studies to investigate the origin of albinism in captive-bred Micos cavefish. We discovered that albino Micos cavefish harbor two copies of a loss-of-function ocular and cutaneous albinism type II (Oca2) allele previously identified in the geographically distant Pachon cave population. This result suggests that phylogenetically young Micos cavefish and phylogenetically old Pachon cave fish inherited this Oca2 allele from the ancestral surface-dwelling taxon. This likely resulted from the presence of the loss-of-function Oca2 haplotype in the 'young' ancestral surface-dwelling stock that colonized the Micos cave and also introgressed into the ancient Pachon cave population. The appearance of albinism in captive Micos cavefish, caused by the same loss-of-function allele present in Pachon cavefish, implies that geographically and phylogenetically distinct cave populations can evolve the same troglomorphic phenotype from standing genetic variation present in the ancestral taxon.

Based on a comprehensive sampling of all known species of the group we here assess their range-wide phylogeography using DNA sequences of the mitochondria] cytochrome b and the nuclear Rag-1 gene. We found E. etheridgei, E. cubanus, and E. orientalis to be genetically highly distinct, with uncorrected pair-wise distances >12% in the cytochrome b gene and >5% in the 16S rRNA gene, and without haplotype sharing in the Rag-1 gene. On the contrary, E. iberia, E. jaumei, E. limbatus, and one unnamed lineage from Gran Piedra mountains had lower mitochondrial divergences to each other (<6% in cytochrome b <3% in 16S) and extensive Rag-1 haplotype sharing, suggesting that their species status requires careful revision. All species and lineages of the group occur in the mountain areas of eastern Cuba and only one of them, E. limbatus, colonized central and western Cuba. Populations of this latter lineage are only weakly genetically differentiated, and its range expansion to western Cuba is probably Pleistocenic, demonstrating that also miniaturized frog species are able of considerable range expansions (over hundreds of kilometers) in short time spans. A phylogeny based on about 5 kb of mitochondrial and nuclear genes places, with maximum support, E. etheridgei basalmost in the group, followed by E. cubanus, E. orientalis, and the E. iberia-jaumei-limbatus clade. The screening of skin alkaloids revealed the presence of alkaloids in all lineages of the group, but alkaloids known to be sequestered by other anurans were not found in the basalmost E. etheridgei. Furthermore, individuals of the derived lineages of the E. iberia-jaumei-limbatus clade had a much larger variety of different alkaloid -compounds (3-18) than the other three species (0-4). Traces of alkaloids were found in other species only remotely related to the E. limbatus group, i.e., E. caspari, E. goini, E. ricordii, and E. tetaJulyia. According to these findings, it can be hypothesized that the capacity to sequester dietary alkaloids into the skin evolved first in an ancestral, litter-dwelling and small-sized Cuban Eleutherodactylus, followed by evolution of miniaturization and diurnality in the early representatives of the E. limbatus group, and eventually by increased brightness of color with probable aposematic function and a highly efficient mechanism of alkaloid sequestering.

In this paper, we provide digital X-rays and new osteological evidence that include 11 characters that reaffirms its placement within the infraorder Gekkota and eight characters that specifically place this fossil within the species-rich genus Sphaerodactylus, in which it was originally described. This contribution seeks to eliminate remaining scepticism about the generic allocation of this species, and to provide a reliable calibration point for ongoing research in squamate phylogenetics, especially for biogeographical studies and molecular dating inference. This contribution also reviews many diagnostic characters for the two genera in question, which is critical for the correct identification of amber-embedded specimens representing the rich Hispaniolan lizard paleocommunity.

Phylogenetic relationships of 116 Scrophularia taxa were investigated based on two plastid (ndhF and trnL-trnF) and one nuclear (ITS) DNA regions. A wider time-calibrated analysis of ndhF sequences of the Lamiales revealed that Scrophularia diverged as early as in the Miocene (<22 Ma). Results of maximum-likelihood optimizations supported wasp pollination as the ancestral pollination system from which other systems derived (hoverfly, mixed vertebrate-insect and bird systems). Four origins for a mixed vertebrate-insect (MVI) pollination system were inferred, in which two western Mediterranean species (S. sambucifolia and S. grandiflora) and two island species (the Tirrenian S. trifoliata and the Canarian S. calliantha) were involved. S. calliantha is the only species in which a more complex MVI system, including pollination by the lizard Gallotia stehlini, has evolved. In addition, bird (hummingbird) floral traits found in the New Mexican S. macrantha appear to have been independently acquired. In contrast, we failed to find evidence for an ancient role of hummingbirds in the evolution of European Scrophularia. Indeed, paleontological data revealed that extinction of European hummingbirds (30-32 Ma) occurred earlier than the divergence of European MVI lineages of Scrophularia. In conclusion, our results showed that a role of birds in pollination of Scrophularia may not have been effective in the Miocene-Pliocene, but bird pollination that shows its origin in the Pliocene-Pleistocene is still operating independently in different islands and continents.

A conserved trait within the arthropods is the utilization of a conserved set of regulatory genes that specify the appendage podomeres along the proximo-distal axis, termed the limb gap genes. These include extradenticle, homothorax, dachshund, and Distal-less. The deployment of these genes in the most basally branching arthropod group, the chelicerates, has only been studied in detail in two chelicerate groups, the harvestmen and spiders. Given the broad range of appendage diversity within the chelicerates, comparative studies of gap gene deployment in other chelicerates groups is needed. We therefore followed limb gap gene expression in a member of the largest chelicerate group, Acari, the oribatid mite Archegozetes longisetosus. We show that in contrast to many arthropod species, A. longisetosus expresses homothorax and extradenticle exclusively in the proximal portion of the appendages, which refutes the hypothesis of a sister-group relationship between chelicerates and myriapods. We also provide evidence that mites posses the ancestral chelicerate condition of possessing three-segmented chelicerae, which also express the gene dachshund. This adds support to the hypothesis that a cheliceral dachshund domain is ancestral to arachnids. Lastly, we provide evidence that the suppression of the fourth pair of walking legs, a putative synapomorphy for Acari, is accomplished by repressing the development of the medial and distal regions of the limb.

Nevertheless, since Latimer and Ohman (2001) reported on severe congenital pathology in KNM-WT 15000, it is questionable whether this skeleton can still be used as reference for Homo erectus skeletal biology. The asserted pathologies include platyspondylic and diminutive vertebrae implying a disproportionately short stature spina bifida condylus tertius spinal stenosis and scoliosis. Based on this symptom complex, the differential diagnosis of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda, an extremely rare form of skeletal dysplasia, has been proposed. Yet, our reanalysis of these pathologies shows that the shape of the KNM-WT 15000 vertebrae matches that of normal modern human adolescents. The vertebrae are not abnormally flat, show no endplate irregularities, and thus are not platyspondylic. As this is the hallMarchk of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda and related forms of skeletal dysplasia, the absence of platyspondyly refutes axial dysplasia and disproportionate dwarfism. Furthermore, we neither found evidence for spina bifida occulta nor manifesta, whereas the condylus tertius, a developmental anomaly of the cranial base, is not related to skeletal dysplasias. Other fossils indicate that the relatively small size of the vertebrae and the narrow spinal canal are characteristics of early hominins rather than congenital pathologies. Except for the recently described signs of traumatic lumbar disc herniation, the Nariokotome boy fossil therefore seems to belong to a normal Homo erectus youth without pathologies of the axial skeleton.

Sequences from two mitochondrial and four nuclear genes indicate that the Patagonian bridled finches Melanodera are the closest relatives of the South Atlantic finches. Melanodera typically was sister to Rowettia, although some genes linked it more closely to Nesospiza. There was no evidence that Rowettia and Nesospiza are sister taxa, suggesting that the South Atlantic finches evolved from Septemberarate colonization events, as apparently was the case for moorhens Gallinula spp. at the two island groups. Genetic divergence between the two island finch genera thus provides an estimate of the maximum period of time they have been present at the islands, some 3-5 million years. A brief review of colonization histories suggests that island hopping by passerine birds is infrequent among islands more than 100-200 km apart. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The rostral end of the swim bladder lies adjacent to Baudelot's ligament which spans between the bulla and the cleithrum bone of the pectoral girdle. The aim of this study was to use the auditory evoked potential technique to physiologically test the possibility that this structure provides an enhanced sensitivity to sound pressure in the bigeye. At 100 Hz, bigeye had hearing sensitivity similar to that of goldfish (species with a mechanical connection between the swim bladder and the inner ear mediated by the Weberian ossicles) and were much more sensitive than other teleosts without ancillary hearing structures. Severing Baudelot's ligament bilaterally resulted in a Marchked Decemberrease in hearing sensitivity, as did swim bladder puncture or lateral line blockage. These results show that bigeye have an enhanced sensitivity to sound pressure and provide experimental evidence that the functional basis of this sensitivity represents a Novemberel hearing specialization in fish involving the swim bladder, Baudelot's ligament and the lateral line.

Epidendrum displays a significant degree of morphological variation, chromosome number diversity and ecological interactions, which challenges widely held views on reproductive barriers and habitat selection. The widespread geographical distribution of many species and populations offers interesting opportunities to investigate how climatic changes and historic demographic processes shaped the current patterns of genetic and species diversity across different biomes and landscapes. Questions involving chromosome barriers to gene exchange and the role of postzygotic genetic barriers in species cohesion (e.g., the contributions of habitat selection and niche divergence on species cohesion) could be easily addressed when using the variety of natural hybrid zones found across Epidendrum. Several key evolutionary questions could be addressed with this model system, such as the identification of the first stages of adaptive radiation, the evolution of pollination strategies, the adaptive ecological significance of trait variation and hybridisation, the influence of historical demographic events on lineage diversification and speciation. With the advance of cost-effective molecular techniques and by combining ecological and phenotypic data, researchers can now tackle these questions and foster significant progress in the field of Neotropical plant diversification and evolution.

In the course of evolution there occurred selection of robust, flexible, modular systems capable for adaptive self-organization by non-linear interaction of components, which leads to formation of the ordered in space and time robust and plastic organization of the whole. Cells of multicellular organisms are capable for coordinated social behavior with formation of ordered cell assemblies, which provides a possibility of morphological and functional variability correlating with manifestations of the large spectrum of adaptive reactions. The multicellular organism is the multilevel system with hierarchy of numerous subsystems capable for adaptive self-organization disturbance of their homeostasis can lead to pathological changes. The healthy organism regulates homeostasis, self-renewal, differentiation, and apoptosis of cells serving its parts and construction blocks by preserving its integrity and controlling behavior of cells.

The Nachukui Formation of the Turkana Basin in northern Kenya, containing Oldowan and Acheulean tool assemblages and fossil evidence for early members of Homo and Paranthropus, provides an extensive spatial and temporal paleosol record of early Pleistocene savanna flora. Here we present new carbon isotopic (delta C-13(VPDB)) values of pedogenic carbonates (68 nodules, 193 analyses) from the Nachukui Formation in order to characterize past vegetation structure and change through time. We compared three members (Kalochoro, Kaitio, and Natoo) at five locations spanning 2.4-1.4 Ma and sampled in proximity to hominin archaeological and paleontological sites. Our results indicate diverse habitats showing a mosaic pattern of vegetation cover at each location yet demonstrate grassland expansion through time influenced by paleogeography. Kalochoro floodplains occurred adjacent to large river systems, and paleosols show evidence of C-3 woodlands averaging 46-50% woody cover. Kaitio habitats were located along smaller rivers and lake Marchgins. Paleosols yielded evidence for reduced portions of woody vegetation averaging 34-37% woody cover. Natoo environments had the highest percentage of grasslands averaging 21% woody cover near a diminishing Lake Turkana precursor. We also compared paleosol delta C-13(VPDB) values of lithic archaeological sites with paleosol delta C-13(VPDB) values of all environments available to hominins at 2.4-1.4 Ma in the Nachukui and Koobi Fora Formations. Grassy environments became more widespread during this interval woody canopy cover mean percentages steadily Decemberreased by 12%. However, significantly more wooded savanna habitats were present in the vicinity of lithic archaeological sites and did not mirror the basin-wide trend of grassland spread. Hominin lithic archaeological sites consistently demonstrated woody cover circa 40% throughout our study interval and were 4-12% more woody than coeval basin environs. We propose that Turkana Basin early tool makers may have preferred a more wooded portion of the savanna ecosystem to reduce heat stress and to gain differential access to potable water, raw materials, animal carcasses, and edible plants.

Although both hermaphroditism and dioecy occur in many diverse clades, we know little about the long-term evolutionary consequences of changing sexual system. Here we find evidence for at least 133 transitions between sexual systems in mosses, representing an almost unparalleled lability in the evolution of their sexual systems. Furthermore, in contrast to predictions, the transition rate from hermaphroditism to dioecy was approximately twice as high as the reverse transition. Our results also suggest that hermaphrodites may have higher rates of diversification than dioecious mosses. These results illustrate the utility of mosses for understanding the genomic and macroevolutionary consequences of hermaphroditism and dioecy.

Research on their origin often focuses on the evolution of the wing with trends of forelimb elongation traced back through many nonavian maniraptoran dinosaurs. We present evidence that the relative forelimb elongation within avian antecedents is priMarchily due to allometry and is instead driven by a reduction in body size. Once body size is factored out, there is no trend of increasing forelimb length until the origin of birds. We report that early birds and nonavian theropods have significantly different scaling relationships within the forelimb and hindlimb skeleton. Ancestral forelimb and hindlimb allometric scaling to body size is rapidly Decemberoupled at the origin of birds, when wings significantly elongate, by evolving a positive allometric relationship with body size from an ancestrally negative allometric pattern and legs significantly shorten by keeping a similar, near isometric relationship but with a reduced intercept. These results have implications for the evolution of powered flight and early diversification of birds. They suggest that their limb lengths first had to be dissociated from general body size scaling before expanding to the wide range of fore and hindlimb shapes and sizes present in today's birds.

MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION	Mollusca Mitochondrial genome Genome arrangement Phylogeny	COMPLETE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME COMPLETE DNA-SEQUENCE COMPLETE MTDNA PHYLOGENETIC INFERENCES MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY BIVALVIA VENERIDAE EVOLUTION GENE GASTROPODA ORGANIZATION	The origin of molluscs among lophotrochozoan metazoans is unresolved and interclass relationships are contradictory between morphology-based, multi-locus, and recent phylogenomic analyses. Within the Deep Metazoan Phylogeny framework, all available molluscan mitochondrial genomes were compiled, covering 6 of 8 classes. Genomes were reannotated, and 13 protein coding genes (PCGs) were analyzed in various taxon settings, under multiple masking and coding regimes. Maximum Likelihood based methods were used for phylogenetic reconstructions. In all cases, molluscs result mixed up with lophotrochozoan outgroups, and most molluscan classes with more than single representatives available are non-monophyletic. We discuss systematic errors such as long branch attraction to cause aberrant, basal positions of fast evolving ingroups such as scaphopods, patellogastropods and, in particular, the gastropod subgroup Heterobranchia. Mitochondrial sequences analyzed either as amino acids or nucleotides may perform well in some (Cephalopoda) but not in other palaeozoic molluscan groups they are not suitable to reconstruct deep (Cambrian) molluscan evolution. Supposedly rare mitochondria] genome level features have long been promoted as phylogenetically informative. In our newly annotated data set, features such as genome size, transcription on one or both strands, and certain coupled pairs of PCGs show a homoplastic, but obviously non-random distribution. Apparently congruent (but not unambiguous) signal for non-trivial subclades, e.g. for a clade composed of pteriomorph and heterodont bivalves, needs confirmation from a more comprehensive bivalve sampling. We found that larger clusters not only of PCGs but also of rRNAs and even tRNAs can bear local phylogenetic signal adding trnG-trnE to the end of the ancestral cluster trnM-trnC-trnY-trnW-trnQ might be synapomorphic for Mollusca. Mitochondrial gene arrangement and other genome level features explored and reviewed herein thus failed as golden bullets, but are promising as additional characters or evidence supporting deep molluscan clades revealed by other data sets. A representative and dense sampling of molluscan subgroups may contribute to resolve contentious interclass relationships in the future, and is vital for exploring the evolution of especially diverse mitochondrial genomes in molluscs.

For comparative purposes, the osteology of other putative ichthyoDecembertiforms is described or discussed. We focus on the description of hitherto poorly described species such as Chiromystus mawsoni Cope, 1885, Ghrisichthys bardacki (Cavin, 1997a), Saurodon' intermedius (Newton, 1878) and Thrissops sp. from Kimmeridge, England. Sixty-nine morphological characters are defined and analysed to infer the phylogenetic relationships within ichthyoDecembertiforms. The main results are: (1) exclusion of Ascalabothrissops and Pachythrissops from the ichthyoDecembertiforms (2) redesignation of IchthyoDecembertes' bardacki, from the Turonian of Morocco, to Ghrisichthys gen. November. (3) resolution of a monophyletic family Cladocyclidae grouping mid-Cretaceous ichthyoDecembertiforms that lived mainly along the southern Marchgin of Tethys (Chirocentrites, Cladocyclus, EubioDecembertes, Chiromystus) (4) resolution of a Late Cretaceous family IchthyoDecembertidae containing IchthyoDecembertes, Ghrisichthys and Xiphactinus from mid-northern latitude seas and (5) a better resolved Late Cretaceous family Saurodontidae in the northern hemisphere, that includes the genus Gillicus.

Enamel knots, specialized areas of dental epithelium where cusps initiate, act as signaling centers that direct the growth of surrounding tissues. For a new cusp to form, an enamel knot must form beyond the inhibition fields of other enamel knots. The model predicts that the number and size of cusps depends on the spacing between enamel knots, reflected in the spacing between cusps. Recently, work by our group demonstrated that the model predicted Carabelli trait expression in human first molars. Here we test whether differences in Carabelli trait expression along the molar row can also be predicted by the model. Crown areas and intercusp distances were measured from dental casts of 316 individuals with a digital microscope. Although absolute cusp spacing is similar in first and second molars, the smaller size and more triangular shape of second molars results in larger cusp spacing relative to size and, likely, less opportunity for the Carabelli trait to form. The presence and size of the hypocone (HY) and a range of small accessory cusps in a larger sample of 340 individuals were also found to covary with the Carabelli trait in a complex way. The results of this study lend further support to the view that the dentition develops, varies, and evolves as a single functional complex. Am J Phys Anthropol 150:400-408, 2013.

Novemberel and rare forms could be disproportionally attacked by predators that already learned to avoid a pre-existing and more common aposematic form. Alternatively, Novemberel forms could be less frequently attacked if predators are reluctant to attack unknown potential prey (neophobia) or if previous learning allows them to generalise and recognise the Novemberel form as toxic. We used colour variation in polymorphic poison frogs (Oophaga histrionica complex) to test whether predators familiar with one aposematic form do generalise their avoidance behaviour to other aposematic forms. To strengthen our inference, we combined a field test of attack rates to local and non-local models with a lab experiment of generalisation capabilities by newly born chicks. Field predators attacked a significantly lower proportion of 529 aposematic compared to 150 cryptic models. Predators co-occurring with the local aposematic form of O. histrionica equally avoided non-local forms, especially in areas where the species was abundant. Forty-two lab chicks learned to discriminate between an aposematic and a cryptic image, but failed to generalise to other aposematic images, even though we tried with six combinations of aposematic forms. To better mimic the situation in the field, we further tested whether chicks trained with a set of four simultaneous aposematic images would generalise better. They failed to learn the discrimination task. Our data contrast with previous field studies on other poison frogs, and support a role for generalisation, and arguably not neophobia, in predator avoidance of Novemberel aposematic forms.

It is composed of two membrane-spanning subunits, gp91-phox and p22-phox (encoded by CYBB and CYBA, respectively), and three cytoplasmic subunits, p40-phox, p47-phox, and p67-phox (encoded by NCF4, NCF1, and NCF2, respectively). Mutations in any of these genes can result in chronic granulomatous disease, a priMarchy immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent infections. Using evolutionary mapping, we determined that episodes of adaptive natural selection have shaped the extracellular portion of gp91-phox during the evolution of mammals, which suggests that this region may have a function in host-pathogen interactions. On the basis of a resequencing analysis of approximately 35 kb of CYBB, CYBA, NCF2, and NCF4 in 102 ethnically diverse individuals (24 of African ancestry, 31 of European ancestry, 24 of Asian/Oceanians, and 23 US Hispanics), we show that the pattern of CYBA diversity is compatible with balancing natural selection, perhaps mediated by catalase-positive pathogens. NCF2 in Asian populations shows a pattern of diversity characterized by a differentiated haplotype structure. Our study provides insight into the role of pathogen-driven natural selection in an innate immune pathway and sheds light on the role of CYBA in endothelial, nonphagocytic NADPH oxidases, which are relevant in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and other complex diseases.

Many experimental studies have found that epistasis is pervasive, and some indicate that it may follow a general pattern dependent on the fitness effect of the interacting mutations. These studies have, however, typically examined the effect of interactions between a small number of focal mutations in a single genetic background. Here, we extend this approach by considering how the interaction between two beneficial mutations that were isolated from a population of laboratory evolved Escherichia coli changes when they are added to divergent natural isolate strains of E. coli. We find that interactions between the focal mutations and the different genetic backgrounds are common. Moreover, the pair-wise interaction between the focal mutations also depended on their genetic background, being more negative in backgrounds with higher absolute fitness. Together, our results indicate the presence of interactions between focal mutations, but also caution that these interactions depend quantitatively on the wider genetic background.

However, molecular phylogenies based on the 18S and 28S nuclear genes of two Crangonyctoidea species endemic to Iceland, Crymostygius thingvallensis and Crangonyx islandicus, support the taxonomy of these species on the basis of morphological characters. Molecular analyses suggest that the genus Crangonyx is paraphyletic, with the species that is found in Eurasia being highly divergent genetically from the species present in North America and Iceland. Studies of the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Niphargus also warrant further work. The nuclear ITS2 region has recently been proposed as a barcoding Marchker for plants and animals. In addition, ITS2 has been used to build phylogenies at high taxonomic levels by including its secondary structure. In this study, we want to evaluate the applicability of the ITS region for this group of species and describe its characteristics. The taxonomy of C. thingvallensis, as well as the paraphyly of the genus Crangonyx, is supported herein by phylogenies based on the ITS2 variation. The secondary structure and the length of the ITS2 sequences of the Crangonyctoidea and the Niphargidae species studied are highly variable and are characterized by duplications. The ITS2 sequence of Niphargus plateaui is the longest metazoan sequence deposited in the ITS2 database so far. Although saturation was observed in the nucleotide variation of this Marchker, the addition of the secondary structure information for the reconstruction of the phylogeny did not add support to the phylogenetic trees. The ITS1 region, which is known to be more variable than ITS2 and bears a large duplication within C. islandicus, was found to be less useful for phylogenetic reconstruction.

A cladistic analysis of ten genera of aglaspidids sensu stricto, six aglaspidid-like arthropods and 42 Palaeozoic arthropod taxa indicates that Xenopoda, Cheloniellida, Aglaspidida sensu lato and Trilobitomorpha form a clade (Artiopoda Hou and Bergstrom, 1997) nested within the mandibulate stem-lineage, thus discarding previous interpretations of these taxa as part 'of the chelicerate stem-group (Arachnomorpha Heider, 1913). The results confirm an aglaspidid identity for several recently described arthropods, including Quasimodaspis brentsae, Tremaglaspis unite, Chlupacaris dubia, Australaglaspis stonyensis and an unnamed Ordovician Chinese arthropod. The problematic Bohemian arthropod Kodymirus vagans was recovered as sister taxon to Beckwithia typa, and both form a small clade that falls outside Aglaspidida sensu stricto, thus discarding eurypterid affinities for the former. The analysis does not support the phylogenetic position of Kwanyinaspis maotianshanensis at the base of Conciliterga as proposed in recent studies, but rather occupies a basal position within Aglaspidida sensu lato. The results indicate a close association of aglaspidid arthropods with xenopods (i.e. Emeraldella and Sidneyia) and cheloniellids (e.g. Cheloniellon, Duslia) the new clade Vicissicaudata is proposed to encompass these arthropods, which are characterized by a differentiated posterior region. The phylogenetic position of aglaspidid arthropods makes them good outgroup candidates for analysing the internal relationships within the groups that form Trilobitomorpha. This work provides a much clearer picture of the phylogenetic relationships among Lower Palaeozoic lamellipedians.

We present a nine-gene dataset across 15 chirostyloids, including all known yeti crabs (Kiwaidae), to improve the resolution of phylogenetic affinities within and between the different families, and to date key divergences using fossil calibrations. This study supports the monophyly of Chirostyloidea and, within this, a basal split between Eumunididae and a Kiwaidae-Chirostylidae clade. All three families originated in the Mid-Cretaceous, but extant kiwaids and most chirostylids radiated from the Eocene onwards. Within Kiwaidae, the basal split between the seep-endemic Kiwa puravida and a vent clade comprising Kiwa hirsuta and Kiwa spp. found on the East Scotia and Southwest Indian ridges is compatible with a hypothesized seep-to-vent evolutionary trajectory. A divergence date estimate of 13.4-25.9 Ma between the Pacific and non-Pacific lineages is consistent with Kiwaidae spreading into the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean via the newly opened Drake Passage. The recent radiation of Kiwaidae adds to the list of chemosynthetic fauna that appear to have diversified after the Palaeocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum, a period of possibly widespread anoxia/dysoxia in deep-sea basins.

Because silencing is targeted by TE-derived piRNAs, piRNA production is posited to be central to the evolution of genome defense. We harnessed genomic data sets from Drosophila melanogaster, including genome-wide measures of piRNA, mRNA, and genomic abundance, along with estimates of age structure and risk of ectopic recombination, to address fundamental questions about the functional and evolutionary relationships between TE families and their regulatory piRNAs. We demonstrate that mRNA transcript abundance, robustness of ping-pong amplification, and representation in piRNA clusters together explain the majority of variation in piRNA abundance between TE families, providing the first robust statistical support for the prevailing model of piRNA biogenesis. Intriguingly, we also discover that the most transpositionally active TE families, with the greatest capacity to induce harmful mutations or disrupt gametogenesis, are not necessarily the most abundant among piRNAs. Rather, the level of piRNA targeting is largely independent of recent transposition rate for active TE families, but is rapidly lost for inactive TEs. These observations are consistent with population genetic theory that suggests a limited selective advantage for host repression of transposition. Additionally, we find no evidence that piRNA targeting responds to selection against a second major cost of TE infection: ectopic recombination between TE insertions. Our observations confirm the pivotal role of piRNA-mediated silencing in defending the genome against selfish transposition, yet also suggest limits to the optimization of host genome defense.

Its insular species were utilized in studies of artificial hybrid fertility, testing the validity of Baker's law, the application of DNA barcodes, and the phylogenetic utility of inter-simple sequence repeat Marchkers. Despite this considerable interest in Tolpis, little is known about its phylogenetic history. Past investigations were unable to resolve most of the interspecific relationships, especially within the Canary Islands, where the genus is particularly diverse. Incomplete taxon sampling, the use of ambiguous outgroups and the limited utility of slowly evolving chloroplast DNA Marchkers precluded detailed reconstructions. The present investigation presents a comprehensive molecular phylogeny of Tolpis. By utilizing highly variable nuclear DNA Marchkers and a comprehensive taxon set, we have resolved the majority of interspecific relationships in the genus. Evaluations of competing tree topologies and ancestral area reconstructions complemented the analyses. Our results highlight the presence of three dominant mechanisms of island plant evolution-island colonization, adaptive radiation and interspecific hybridization-in Tolpis: (i) the extant distribution of the genus is the result of two independent colonization pathways, (ii) Tolpis has colonized at least one archipelago multiple times, (iii) the present insular diversity is the product of adaptive radiation, (iv) potential hybridization was detected between species now inhabiting different islands and archipelagoes, indicating sympatric historical distributions, and (v) several undescribed species await taxonomic recognition.

Here, we investigate the population genetics of Pasteuria ramosa, a bacterial parasite of Daphnia. We used natural P. ramosa spore banks from the sediments of two geographically well-Septemberarated ponds to experimentally infect a panel of Daphnia magna host clones whose resistance phenotypes were previously known. In this way, we were able to assess the population structure of P. ramosa based on geography, host resistance phenotype and host genotype. Overall, genetic diversity of P. ramosa was high, and nearly all infected D. magna hosted more than one parasite haplotype. On the basis of the observation of recombinant haplotypes and relatively low levels of linkage disequilibrium, we conclude that P. ramosa engages in substantial recombination. Isolates were strongly differentiated by pond, indicating that gene flow is spatially restricted. Pasteuria ramosa isolates within one pond were segregated completely based on the resistance phenotype of the hosta result that, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported for a nonhuman parasite. To assess the comparability of experimental infections with natural P. ramosa isolates, we examined the population structure of naturally infected D. magna native to one of the two source ponds. We found that experimental and natural infections of the same host resistance phenotype from the same source pond were indistinguishable, indicating that experimental infections provide a means to representatively sample the diversity of P. ramosa while reducing the sampling bias often associated with studies of parasite epidemics. These results expand our knowledge of this model parasite, provide important context for the large existing body of research on this system and will guide the design of future studies of this host-parasite system.

A robust phylogeny of this genus is important for understanding the evolution of the immense variety of morphological and behavioural traits exhibited by this group. We infer a phylogeny of Osmia using DNA sequence data obtained from three nuclear genes (elongation factor 1-, LW-rhodopsin and CAD) and the mitochondrial gene COI. Our taxon sampling places special attention on North American members of the subgenus Melanosmia Schmiedeknecht we discuss the Novemberel placement of a number of species traditionally assigned to O. (Melanosmia) and examine the relative support for alternative classifications of this species-rich subgenus. We use this new phylogeny to guide a reassessment of morphological and behavioural characters within Osmia. Our results provide support for the recognition of Osmia (Hapsidosmia), subgen.n., a monotypic subgenus containing Osmia iridis Cockerell & Titus. We synonymize Osmia (Mystacosmia) Snelling under O. (Melanosmia), syn.n. We synonymize Osmia (Acanthosmioides) Ashmead under O. (Melanosmia), syn.n., propose odontogaster species group' as a replacement for the subgeneric name Acanthosmioides, and refine the morphological characters that serve to diagnose the species group. We additionally propose nigrifrons species group' for a clade within O. (Melanosmia) containing most species formerly placed in Osmia (Centrosmia) Robertson. We demonstrate more cohesive patterns of nest substrate use in the nigrifrons and odontogaster species groups than was previously believed to occur, reconsider character polarity of aspects of the female mandible, and show that a large number of morphological characters have evolved convergently within the genus. In order to facilitate discussion of relevant taxa, we propose the following 15 new synonymies: O. bakeri Sandhouse under O. melanopleura Cockerell O. crenulaticornis Michener under O. pinorum Cockerell O. claremontensis Michener under O. sedula Sandhouse O. cockerelli Sandhouse under O. dakotensis Michener O. francisconis White under O. enixa Sandhouse O. hurdi White under O. austroMarchitima Michener O. sladeni Sandhouse under O. nifoata Cockerell O. titusi Cockerell under O. phenax Cockerell O. subtrevoris Cockerell, O. physariae Cockerell, and O. erecta Michener under O. giliarum Cockerell and O. universitatis Cockerell, O. integrella Cockerell, O. amala Cockerell, and O. metitia Cockerell under O. nigrifrons Cresson, syn.n.

Here, we used nuclear single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Marchkers and a mitochondrial gene to characterize phylogeographic structure and the extent of mitonuclear discordance in Potamopyrgus antipodarum. This New Zealand freshwater snail is often used to study the evolution and maintenance of sex because obligately sexual and obligately asexual individuals often coexist. While our data indicate that sexual and asexual P.antipodarum sampled from the same lake population are often genetically similar, suggesting recent origin of these asexuals from sympatric sexual P.antipodarum, we also found significantly more population structure in sexuals vs. asexuals. This latter result suggests that some asexual lineages originated in other lakes and/or in the relatively distant past. When comparing mitochondrial and nuclear population genetic structure, we discovered that one mitochondrial haplotype ('1A') was rare in sexuals, but common and widespread in asexuals. Haplotype 1A frequency and nuclear genetic diversity were not associated, suggesting that the commonness of this haplotype cannot be attributed entirely to genetic drift and pointing instead to a role for selection.

Out of 134 species of Gamopetalae meiotically investigated, chromosome numbers for 30 accessions belonging to 17 species and six families are new or varied reports. Euphrasia paucifolia (n = 22), Lactuca Decemberipiens (n = 8), Saussurea albescens (n = 17), Saussurea roylei (n = 16), Saussurea taraxacifolia (n = 16) and Veronica deltigera (n = 8) are first cytological reports for these species. Anaphalis nepalensis (n = 28), Codonopsis rotundifolia (n = 16) and Hieracium vulgatum (n = 27) are new euploid chromosome reports for these species suggesting potential speciation through chromosomal evolution. Besides, Androsace mucronifolia (n = 10), A. sempervivoides (n = 10), Cicerbita lessertiana (n = 8), Dracocephalum nutans (n = 5), Erigeron patentisquama (n = 9), Galium pauciflorum (n = 11), Onopordum acanthium (n = 17) and Xanthium spinosum (n = 8) are the first chromosome reports to Indian accessions of the species. Out of the 17 species, 9 species (52.9 %) viz. A. nepalensis, C. lessertiana, C. rotundifolia, D. nutans, E. patentisquama, Euphrasia paucifolia, L. Decemberipiens, O. acanthium and V. deltigera show abnormal meiosis/microsporogenesis of one or other type, thereby leading to pollen anomalies.

Enzymes able to degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides are widely distributed in micro-organisms but are generally absent in animals, although their presence in insects, especially phytophagous beetles from the superfamilies Chrysomeloidea and Curculionoidea, has recently begun to be appreciated. The observed patchy distribution of endogenous genes encoding these enzymes in animals has raised questions about their evolutionary origins. Recent evidence suggests that endogenous plant cell wall degrading enzymes-encoding genes have been acquired by animals through a mechanism known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT). HGT describes how genetic material is moved by means other than vertical inheritance from a parent to an offspring. Here, we provide evidence that the mustard leaf beetle, Phaedon cochleariae, possesses in its genome genes encoding active xylanases from the glycoside hydrolase family 11 (GH11). We also provide evidence that these genes were originally acquired by P. cochleariae from a species of gammApriloteobacteria through HGT. This represents the first example of the presence of genes from the GH11 family in animals.

Here we analyze genomic heterogeneity of genetic differentiation and introgression in a hybrid zone between two bird species (Manacus candei and M. vitellinus) using 59100 SNPs, a whole genome assembly, and Bayesian models. Measures of genetic differentiation (FST) and introgression (genomic cline center [] and rate []) were highly heterogeneous among loci. We identified thousands of loci with elevated parameter estimates, some of which are likely to be associated with variation in fitness in Manacus populations. To analyze the genomic organization of differentiation and introgression, we mapped SNPs onto a draft assembly of the M. vitellinus genome. Estimates of FST, , and were autocorrelated at very short physical distances (<100 bp), but much less so beyond this. In addition, average statistical associations (linkage disequilibrium) between SNPs were generally low and were not higher in admixed populations than in populations of the parental species. Although they did not occur with a constant probability across the genome, loci with elevated FST, , and were not strongly co-localized in the genome. Contrary to verbal models that predict clustering of loci involved in adaptation and isolation in discrete genomic regions, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic regions involved in adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation are scattered throughout the genome. We also found that many loci were characterized by both exceptional genetic differentiation and introgression, consistent with the hypothesis that loci involved in isolation are also often characterized by a history of divergent selection. However, the concordance between isolation and differentiation was only partial, indicating a complex architecture and history of loci involved in isolation.

However, studies of the evolution of this key trait have yet to explore the full potential of the fossil record, being limited by the difficulty of obtaining endocranial data from fossils. Using measurements of endocranial volume, length, height, and width of the braincase in 503 adult specimens from 199 extant species, representing 99 of 133 extant mammalian families, we expand upon a simple method of using multiple regression to develop a formula for estimating brain size from external skull measurements. We also examined non-mammalian synapsids to assess the phylogenetic limits of our model's application. Model-predicted volume correlates strongly with measured volume (R-2 = 0.993) and prediction error is between 16% and 19%. Error Decemberreases if models developed for well-sampled subclades such as primates or rodents are used, demonstrating that some differential evolution of the relationship between brain size and skull size has occurred. However, reanalysis using phylogenetically independent contrasts demonstrates weak phylogenetic dependency, indicating that our model is appropriate for estimating the endocranial volume of species of unknown phylogenetic affinity. Thus, the model represents a generally applicable, fast and cost-efficient way to dramatically expand the taxonomic and temporal scope of mammalian brain size data sets. Even endocranial volumes of taxa with highly derived crania, such as cetaceans and monotremes, can be estimated confidently. However, the model works best for generalized placental crania. Fundamental differences in cranial architecture suggest that the model cannot provide accurate estimates of endocranial volume in non-mammalian synapsids more basal than Morganucodon (ca. 200 Ma). Therefore, use of the model for taxa phylogenetically distant from the mammalian crown group is not warranted, but it might be used to establish relative brain sizes between closely related subgroups.

To understand how populations are affected by noise, we must understand how individuals are affected by noise. By modifying the acoustic environment experimentally, we studied the potential relationship between noise levels and both spatial and singing behaviour in the European robin (Erithacus rubecula). We found that with increasing noise levels, males were more likely to move away from the noise source and changed their singing behaviour. Our results provide the first experimental evidence in a free ranging species, that not merely the presence of noise causes changes in behaviour and distribution, but that the level of noise pollution plays a crucial role as well. Our results have important implications for estimating the impact of infrastructure which differs in the level of noise produced. Thus, governmental planning bodies should not only consider the physical effect on the landscape when assessing the impact of new infrastructure, but also the noise levels emitted, which may reduce the loss of suitable habitats available for animals.

In order to test this hypothesis, a phylogeny of the cryptic arachnid order Ricinulei, based on four nuclear and mitochondrial DNA Marchkers, was inferred. This ancient clade of litter-dwelling arthropods, endemic to the priMarchy forests of Western and Central Africa and the Neotropics, might provide insights into the mode and tempo of evolution in Africa. Twenty-six African ricinuleid specimens were sampled from eight countries spanning the distribution of Ricinulei on the continent, and analysed together with Neotropical samples plus other arachnid outgroups. The phylogenetic and molecular dating results suggest that Ricinulei diversified in association with the fragmentation of Gondwana. The early diversification of Ricinoides in Western and Central Africa around 88 (+/- 33) Ma fits old palaeogeographical events better than recent climatic fluctuations. Unlike most recent molecular studies, these results agree with fossil evidence, suggesting that refugia may have acted as 'museums' conserving ancient diversity rather than as engines generating diversity during successive episodes of climatic fluctuation in Africa.

Reefs are structurally complex, highly productive shallow-water Marchine ecosystems found in tropical (coral reefs) and temperate zones (rocky reefs) that harbor exceptional levels of biodiversity. We investigated whether reef habitats promote the evolution of morphological diversity in the feeding and locomotion systems of grunts (Haemulidae), a group of predominantly nOctoberurnal fishes that live on both temperate and tropical reefs. Using phylogenetic comparative methods and statistical analyses that take into account uncertainty in phylogeny and the evolutionary history of reef living, we demonstrate that rates of morphological evolution are faster in reef-dwelling haemulids. The magnitude of this effect depends on the type of trait on average, traits involved in the functional systems for prey capture and processing evolve twice as fast on reefs as locomotor traits. This result, along with the observation that haemulids do not exploit unique feeding niches on reefs, suggests that fine-scale trophic niche partitioning and character displacement may be driving higher rates of morphological evolution. Whatever the cause, there is growing evidence that reef habitats stimulate morphological and functional diversification in teleost fishes.

Recent work re-dating key African early Homo localities and the discovery of new fossils in East Africa and Georgia provide the opportunity for a productive re-evaluation of this topic. Here, we test the hypothesis that the cranial sample from East Africa and Georgia represents a single evolutionary lineage of Homo spanning the approximately 1.91.5 Mya time period, consisting of specimens attributed to H. habilis and H. erectus. To address issues of small sample sizes in each time period, and uneven representation of cranial data, we developed a Novemberel nonparametric randomization technique based on the variance in an index of pairwise difference from a broad set of fossil comparisons. We fail to reject the hypothesis of a single lineage this period by identifying a strong, time-dependent pattern of variation throughout the sequence. These results suggest the need for a reappraisal of fossil evidence from other regions within this time period and highlight the critical nature of the Plio-Pleistocene boundary for understanding the early evolution of the genus Homo.

The increasing accessibility of genomic tools is making the hunt for genes that underlie evolutionary divergence more tractable and, when combined with physiological approaches, provides exceptional power to elucidate the causal mechanisms of the relationship. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Whitehead etal. (2013) employ this strategy to show that common physiological and genomic mechanisms lead to divergence in salinity tolerance across micro- and macroevolutionary timescales. They compare two killifish species from the genus Fundulus, F.majalis, which inhabits priMarchily Marchine and brackish environments and represents the ancestral state of the genus, and F.heteroclitus, which has derived an osmotic niche that expands into freshwater. Corresponding to the differences in osmotic niche, the species differ strikingly in how the structure of the ion-transporting epithelium and the transcriptome of the gills respond to osmotic challenge. These inter-specific differences were similar to but more pronounced than the differences associated with the more subtle intra-specific variation in osmotic niche within each species. It appears that a progression of the same functional adjustments first allowed expansion of the osmotic niche of F.heteroclitus into freshwater and then further expanded the niche of select F.heteroclitus populations towards more dilute freshwater environments. The work of Whitehead etal. therefore emphasizes how the mechanisms of adaptive divergence between populations can be expanded over time to produce the more complex differences that can exist between species.

A total of 170 individuals from 21 populations were genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR alleles. For comparative purposes, these populations were classified as individualistic (recent history of hunter-gathering) or collectivistic (agriculturalists). These two groups showed an almost identical S allele frequency (75 and 76%, respectively). The analysis of molecular variance showed no structural differences between them. Behavioral typologies like those suggested by JY Chiao and KD Blizinsky (Proc R Soc B 277 () 529-537) are always a simplification of complex phenomena and should be regarded with caution. In addition, classification of a whole nation in the individualist/collectivist dichotomy is controversial. The focus on modes of subsistence in preindustrial societies, as was tested here, may be a good alternative although the postulated association between the 5-HTTLPR S allele and the collectivist societies was not confirmed.

Many morphologists favor a clade Metapterygota (Odonata +Neoptera), but Chiastomyaria (Ephemeroptera + Neoptera) or Palaeoptera (Ephemeroptera +Odonata) has also been supported in some older and more recent studies. A possible explanation for the difficulties in resolving these relationships is concerted convergence-the convergent evolution of entire character complexes under the same or similar selective pressures. In this study, we analyze possible instances of this phenomenon in the context of head structures of Ephemeroptera, Odonata, and Neoptera. We apply a recently introduced formal approach to detect the occurrence of concerted convergence. We found that characters of the tentorium and mandibles in particular, but also some other head structures, have apparently not evolved independently, and thus can cause artifacts in tree reconstruction. Our subsequent analyses, which exclude character sets that may be affected by concerted convergence, corroborate the Palaeoptera concept. We show that the analysis of homoplasy and its influence on tree inference can be formally improved with important consequences for the identification of incompatibilities between data sets. Our results suggest that modified weighting (or exclusion of characters) in cases of formally identified correlated cliques of characters may improve morphology-based tree reconstruction.

In the open ocean, differentiating between the two is particularly difficult, because of the high levels of gene flow found in pelagic communities. Here, we use molecular phylogenetics to test the hypothesis that geography is the priMarchy isolating mechanism in a clade of pelagic nudibranchs, Glaucinae. Our results contradict allopatric expectations: the cosmopolitan Glaucus atlanticus is panmictic, whereas the Indo-Pacific Glaucus Marchginatus contains two pairs of cryptic species with overlapping distributions. Within the G. Marchginatus species complex, a parallel reproductive change has occurred in each cryptic species pair: the loss of a bursa copulatrix. Available G. Marchginatus data are most consistent with non-geographical speciation events, but we cannot rule out the possibility of allopatric speciation, followed by iterative range extension and secondary overlap. Irrespective of ancestral range distributions, our results implicate a central role for reproductive character differentiation in glaucinin speciation-a Novemberel result in a planktonic system.

The manipulation of host density can impose strong selective pressures on pathogen virulence by changing the ecological conditions, thus affecting the effectiveness of eradication programs. We present an analysis of the effect of virulence evolution on culling by extending a susceptible-infected model to the case of competing strains with superinfection. To assess both short-and long-term effects, we first carried out the analysis on an ecological timescale, with a two-strain competition model then we explore the dynamics of a continuum of pathogenic strains on evolutionary timescales using a quantitative genetics approach (when infection and evolutionary processes occur on comparable timescales) and a game-theoretic approach (when evolutionary processes occur on a slower scale). We demonstrate that the competition among pathogenic variants in the presence of superinfection affects outcome of culling campaigns, since increased host mortality may select for less virulent strains able to establish in sparser populations. This can lead to the counterintuitive result that disease abundance and prevalence may even increase with culling, thus making the eradication of infections considerably less likely. This is particularly relevant in the case of zoonoses where higher prevalence and abundance of pathogens in wild reservoirs may increase the risk of spillover in livestock and humans.

Some of the most habitat specialised fishes on coral reefs are obligate coral-dwelling gobies of the genus Gobiodon that inhabit a range of coral species, mostly of the genus Acropora. However, the role of this specialised pattern of habitat use in the evolution of coral-dwelling gobies is not well understood. Diversification of coral-dwelling gobies may be driven by the diversification of their host corals (cospeciation), or alternatively, diversification of these fishes may have occurred independently of the diversification of host corals. The cospeciation hypothesis assumes similar timing in evolution of the gobies and their host corals. We used four genes for each group and the available fossil records to reconstruct and date phylogenies for 20 species of Gobiodon from the Indo-Pacific and the Red Sea, and for 28 species of the coral genus Acropora. Our results indicate that Gobiodon diversified mostly in the last 5 My, whereas Acropora corals have consistently diversified since the Eocene, making the hypothesis of cospeciation untenable. The fully resolved molecular phylogeny of the genus Gobiodon is in part at odds with previous analyses incorporating morphological data and indicates that some morphological traits form paraphyletic clades within Gobiodon. Our phylogeny supports a hypothesis in which Gobiodon diversified in the Indo-Pacific Ocean and then radiated recently, with multiple new variants found in the Red Sea. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Spatial extensions of this work, using simulation studies, show multiple evolutionary outcomes, which strongly depend on trade-off shape and, additionally, the length scale of the infectious process. In this paper, we aim to shed analytical insight into the mechanisms underlying these spatial evolutionary outcomes. In particular, why there is a qualitative difference observed in the evolutionary predicted virulence rates between linear and Decemberelerating trade-offs between transmission and virulence and how recovery can weaken the effect of space. We use both pair approximations and cellular automata to model the spatial populations and the analysis exploits small neighbourhood variations in the spatial settings. The evolutionary outcomes are derived using adaptive dynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	June 22, 2013The oldest dinosaur? A Middle Triassic dinosauriform from Tanzania	BIOLOGY LETTERS	Dinosauria Archosaur radiation Triassic Manda beds phylogeny	EARLY EVOLUTION SILESAURUS-OPOLENSIS ORIGIN PTEROSAURS	The rise of dinosaurs was a major event in vertebrate history, but the timing of the origin and early diversification of the group remain poorly constrained. Here, we describe Nyasasaurus parringtoni gen. et sp. November., which is identified as either the earliest known member of, or the sister-taxon to, Dinosauria. Nyasasaurus possesses a unique combination of dinosaur character states and an elevated growth rate similar to that of definitive early dinosaurs. It demonstrates that the initial dinosaur radiation occurred over a longer timescale than previously thought (possibly 15 Myr earlier), and that dinosaurs and their immediate relatives are better understood as part of a larger Middle Triassic archosauriform radiation. The African provenance of Nyasasaurus supports a southern Pangaean origin for Dinosauria.

Elysia chlorotica harvests plastids (absent of nuclei) from its heterokont algal prey, Vaucheria litorea. The stolen plastids are maintained for several months in cells of the digestive tract and are essential for animal development. The basis of long-term maintenance of photosynthesis in this sea slug was thought to be explained by extensive horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from the nucleus of the alga to the animal nucleus, followed by expression of algal genes in the gut to provide essential plastid-destined proteins. Early studies of target genes and proteins supported the HGT hypothesis, but more recent genome-wide data provide conflicting results. Here, we generated significant genome data from the E. chlorotica germ line (egg DNA) and from V. litorea to test the HGT hypothesis. Our comprehensive analyses fail to provide evidence for alga-derived HGT into the germ line of the sea slug. Polymerase chain reaction analyses of genomic DNA and cDNA from different individual E. chlorotica suggest, however, that algal nuclear genes (or gene fragments) are present in the adult slug. We suggest that these nucleic acids may derive from and/or reside in extrachromosomal DNAs that are made available to the animal through contact with the alga. These data resolve a long-standing issue and suggest that HGT is not the priMarchy reason underlying long-term maintenance of photosynthesis in E. chlorotica. Therefore, sea slug photosynthesis is sustained in as yet unexplained ways that do not appear to endanger the animal germ line through the introduction of dozens of foreign genes.

X-ray micro-computed tomography (mu CT) and conventional computed tomography (CT) were used to acquire 3D data. The analyses of 22 landMarchks revealed a strong body-mass related allometric pattern. A discriminant analysis on allometry-free labyrinthine shape served to evaluate the phylogenetic signal portion of the labyrinth for Macropodiformes, Phalangeroidea, Petauroidea, and Vombatiformes. The inner shape of Thylacoleo is consistent with its phylogenetic placement as a vombatiform.

We estimate gene and species trees within the genus using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA from nearly all named and many candidate species and find three main clades. We use this phylogenetic hypothesis to examine patterns of morphological evolution and species coexistence across central and southern Mexico and to test alternative hypotheses of lineage divergence with and without ecomorphological divergence. Sympatric species differ in body size more than expected after accounting for phylogenetic relationship, and morphological traits show no significant phylogenetic signal. Sympatric species tend to differ in a combination of body size, presence or absence of maxillary teeth, and relative limb or tail length, even when they are close relatives. Sister species of Thorius tend to occupy climatically similar environments, which suggests that divergence across climatic gradients does not drive species formation in the genus. Rather than being an example of cryptic species formation, Thorius more closely resembles an adaptive radiation, with ecomorphological divergence that is bounded by organism-level constraints.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 622-643.

An unlinked locus, mid-banded, modifies the appearance of banded shells. These characters have a very wide range of frequencies across the species range and even within limited areas. In Britain, frequencies differ between populations from shaded woodland habitats and those from closely adjacent open habitats. Using data from the Evolution MegaLab Project, it is shown that the greater frequency of pink unbanded in shaded habitats is associated with a greater excess of the favoured allele combinations, measured as linkage disequilibrium. Examination of the relationship of disequilibrium to allele frequency in samples from the full geographical range and all habitats and climates shows that, in general, the allele combinations at high frequencies are in gametic excess. This suggests that selection tends to diversify rather than move frequencies towards stable equilibria. The result is important in relation to the as yet unresolved question how the polymorphism is maintained.(c) 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 108, 484-493.

The appearance and behaviour of the solitaire was recorded in detail by two observers before it became extinct in the mid 1700s. They described a prominent wing structure termed the musket ball' (carpal knob), which was used as a weapon and to produce an audible signal by either sex in territorial combat. Our study of subfossil solitaire bones from cave localities shows that the carpal knob formed after skeletal maturity, and reached its greatest size in adult males. We describe the morphology of the carpal knob, including its histology in thin section. It is an outgrowth of the processus extensorius of the carpometacarpus, but differs morphologically from homologous structures in other bird taxa, and thus is unique in Aves. We also compare the pectoral and wing osteology of the solitaire with that of the dodo, which had a similar morphology, but lacked any bony outgrowths on the wing. Furthermore, we suggest some biological and environmental factors leading to the evolution of this reMarchkable and unique carpal weapon.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 32-44.

Among the evolutionary mechanisms proposed to account for this diversity, two processes in particular have generated considerable interest. On the one hand, females may exploit postcopulatory mechanisms of selection to favour males with preferred genital traits (cryptic female choice CFC), while on the other hand females may evolve structures or behaviours that mitigate the direct costs imposed by male genitalia (sexual conflict SC). A critical but rarely explored assumption underlying both processes is that male and female reproductive traits coevolve, either via the classic Fisherian model of preference-trait coevolution (CFC) or through sexually antagonistic selection (SC). Here, we provide evidence for this prediction in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a polyandrous livebearing fish in which males transfer sperm internally to females via consensual and forced matings. Our results from a paternal half-sibling breeding design reveal substantial levels of additive genetic variation underlying male genital size and morphology-two traits known to predict mating success during non-consensual matings. Our subsequent finding that physically interacting female genital traits exhibit corresponding levels of genetic (co)variation reveals the potential intersexual coevolutionary dynamics of male and female genitalia, thereby fulfilling a fundamental assumption underlying CFC and SC theory.

Fungus-growing (attine) ants have multiple complex symbioses and thus provide ample opportunities to address questions of symbiont specificity and diversity. Among the partners are Actinobacteria of the genus Pseudonocardia that are maintained on the ant cuticle to produce antibiotics, priMarchily against a fungal parasite of the mutualistic gardens. The symbiosis has been assumed to be a hallMarchk of evolutionary stability, but this notion has been challenged by culturing and sequencing data indicating an unpredictably high diversity. We used 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA to estimate the diversity of the cuticular bacterial community of the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex echinatior and other fungus-growing ants from Gamboa, Panama. Both field and laboratory samples of the same colonies were collected, the latter after colonies had been kept under laboratory conditions for up to 10 years. We show that bacterial communities are highly colony-specific and stable over time. The majority of colonies (25/26) had a single dominant Pseudonocardia strain, and only two strains were found in the Gamboa population across 17 years, confirming an earlier study. The microbial community on newly hatched ants consisted almost exclusively of a single strain of Pseudonocardia while other Actinobacteria were identified on older, foraging ants in varying but usually much lower abundances. These findings are consistent with recent theory predicting that mixtures of antibiotic-producing bacteria can remain mutualistic when dominated by a single vertically transmitted and resource-demanding strain.

AMERICAN NATURALIST	mixed-species bird flocks long-term stability Nouragues biological station home range evolutionarily stable strategy	MULTISPECIES TERRITORIALITY NEOTROPICAL FOREST TROPICAL FOREST DIVERSITY STABILITY COMMUNITY DYNAMICS ECOLOGY GAPS	The stability of tropical systems has been hypothesized to explain the evolution of complex behavioral interactions among species. We evaluate the degree to which one highly evolved social system, mixed-species flocks, are stable in space and time in French Guiana, where flocks were characterized 17 years apart. These flocks are led by alarm-calling sentinels, which may benefit from food flushed by other beater species. Using null models, we found that flock roost sites, home range overlap, and composition were more similar than expected by chance home ranges were nearly identical between the two time periods. Such extremely stable conditions may be essential for the evolution and maintenance of the sentinel-beater system that appears to characterize some flocks. These results may reflect an evolutionarily stable strategy among potentially interdependent species within mixed-species flocks, where home ranges contribute to stability by being far larger than the most common local disturbances in the forest.

Ecological studies have demonstrated its importance in natural communities, but evolutionary models have predicted that selection either impedes coexistence or diminishes the storage effect if there is coexistence. Here, we develop a lottery model of competition in which two species experience a trade-off in competitive ability between two types of years. We use an adaptive evolution framework to determine conditions favoring the evolution of the storage effect. Storage evolves via divergence of relative performance in the two environments under a wide range of biologically realistic conditions. It evolves between two initially identical species (or lineages) when the trade-off in performance is strong enough. It evolves for species having different initial trade-offs for both weak and strong trade-offs. Our simple 2-species-2-environment scenario can be extended to multiple species and environmental conditions. Results indicate that the storage effect should evolve in a broad range of situations that involve a trade-off in competitive ability among years, and are consistent with empirical observations. The findings show that storage can evolve in a manner and under conditions similar to other types of resource partitioning.

The ultrastructure of rhabdites and their morphogenesis in this species resemble those in Macrostomida (Turbellaria, Archoophora). The relative position of muscle layers in the pharynx walls draws Bothrioplana semperi closer to Tricladida Marchicola and some Tricladida paludicola and terricola. The analysis of ultrastructural and morphological characters in Bothrioplana semperi as compared to those in Turbellaria proseriata and tricladida is provided. It is shown that the apomophous to plesiomorphous characters ratio in the taxa analyzed argues most for the hypothesis of an early branching of these groups and the early Turbellaria neoophora as a whole. If this is the case, Proseriata and Tricladida are not sister groups, while Bothrioplanidae should be regarded as a sister group to the ancestors of Tricladida and, possibly, Neodermata.

Signal evolution can be influenced by a diversity of factors such as biophysical constraints on the emitter, the signalling environment, or selection to avoid heterospecific matings. Furthermore, because signals can be costly to produce, trade-offs may exist between different types of signals. Here, we apply phylogenetic comparative analyses to study the evolution of acoustic and visual signals in Asian barbets, a clade of non-Passerine, forest-dependent birds. Our results suggest that evolution of acoustic and visual signals in barbets is influenced by diverse factors, such as morphology and signalling environment, suggesting a potential effect of sensory drive. We found no trade-offs between visual and acoustic signals. Quite to the contrary, more colourful species sing significantly longer songs. Song characteristics presented distinct patterns of evolution. Song frequency diverged early on and the rate of evolution of this trait appears to be constrained by body size. On the other hand, characteristics associated with length of the song presented evidence for more recent divergence. Finally, our results indicate that there is a spatial component to the evolution of visual signals, and that visual signals are more divergent between closely related taxa than acoustic signals. Hence, visual signals in these species could play a role in speciation or reinforcement of reproductive isolation following secondary contacts.

However, only some general features of external brain morphology are evident from endocasts, and many anatomical details can be difficult or impossible to examine. In this study, we use geometric morphometric techniques to evaluate inter- and intraspecific differences in cerebral morphology in a sample of in vivo magnetic resonance imaging scans of chimpanzees and humans, with special emphasis on the study of asymmetric variation. Our study reveals that chimpanzee-human differences in cerebral morphology are mainly symmetric by contrast, there is continuity in asymmetric variation between species, with humans showing an increased range of variation. Moreover, asymmetric variation does not appear to be the result of allometric scaling at intraspecific levels, whereas symmetric changes exhibit very slight allometric effects within each species. Our results emphasize two key properties of brain evolution in the hominine clade: first, evolution of chimpanzee and human brains (and probably their last common ancestor and related species) is not strongly morphologically constrained, thus making their brains highly evolvable and responsive to selective pressures second, chimpanzee and, especially, human brains show high levels of fluctuating asymmetry indicative of pronounced developmental plasticity. We infer that these two characteristics can have a role in human cognitive evolution.	June 22, 2013Stem cell dynamics in Cnidaria: are there unifying principles?

While Hydra has a number of self-renewing cell types that act much like stem cells-in particular the interstitial cell line-finding cellular homologues outside of the Hydrozoa has been complicated by the morphological simplicity of stem cells and inconclusive gene expression data. In non-hydrozoan cnidarians, an enigmatic cell type known as the amoebocyte might play a similar role to interstitial cells, but there is little evidence that I-cells and amoebocytes are homologous. Instead, self-renewal and transdifferentiation of epithelial cells was probably more important to ancestral cnidarian development than any undifferentiated cell lineage, and only later in evolution did one or more cell types come under the regulation of a stem cell line. Ultimately, this hypothesis and competing ones will need to be tested by expanding genetic and developmental studies on a variety of cnidarian model systems.

Here, we investigate the role of the Y chromosome in phenotypic divergence and reproductive isolation of spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) ecotypes. This species contains six known ecotypes (grouped into four subspecies) that exhibit striking differences in morphology, habitat and mating system, despite having adjacent or overlapping ranges and little genetic divergence at previously studied mtDNA and autosomal Marchkers. We examined the phylogeographic structure for all six ecotypes across the species range (n=261, 17 geographic locations) using DNA sequences from three Y chromosome Marchkers, two maternally inherited mitochondrial (mtDNA) Marchkers, and a biparentally inherited autosomal intron. mtDNA and autosomal analyses revealed low divergence (most phi ST values <0.1) between ecotypes and geographic regions, concordant with previous studies. In contrast, Y intron analyses revealed fixed differences amongst the three most phenotypically divergent groups: S.l.longirostris vs. S.l.roseiventris vs. combined S.l.orientalis/S.l.centroamericana/Tres Marchias ecotypes). Another ecotype (whitebelly), previously postulated to be a hybrid between the two phenotypically most divergent ecotypes, had Y haplotypes from both putative parent ecotypes, supporting a hybrid designation. Reduced introgression of the Y chromosome has previously been observed in other organisms ranging from insects to terrestrial mammals, and here we demonstrate this phenomenon in a Marchine mammal with high dispersal capabilities. These results indicate that reduced introgression of the Y chromosome occurs in a wide taxonomic range of organisms and support the growing body of evidence that rapid evolution of the Y chromosome is important in evolutionary diversification.

Three species are currently recognized: Amahuacatherium peruvium, Cuvieronius hyodon, and Notiomastodon platensis. The former is a late Miocene gomphothere whose validity has been questioned by several authors. The other two, C. hyodon and N. platensis, are Quaternary taxa in South America, and they have distinct biogeographic patterns: Andean and lowland distributions, respectively. South American gomphotheres became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of Proboscidea including the South American Quaternary gomphotheres, which resulted in two most parsimonious trees. Our results support a paraphyletic Gomphotheriidae and a monophyletic South American gomphothere lineage: C. hyodon and N. platensis. The late Miocene gomphothere record in Peru, Amahuacatherium peruvium, seems to be a crucial part of the biogeography and evolution of the South American gomphotheres.

Although this idea is a staple of community ecology, convincing empirical evidence has been scarce. Here we examine 34 subterranean beetle communities in arid inland Australia that share the same habitat type but have evolved in complete isolation over the past 5 million years. Although these communities come from a range of phylogenetic origins, we find that they have almost invariably evolved to share a similar size structure. The relative positions of coexisting species on the body size axis were significantly more regular across communities than would be expected by chance, with a size ratio, on average, of 1.6 between coexisting species. By contrast, species' absolute body sizes varied substantially from one community to the next. This suggests that self-organized spacing according to limiting-similarity theory, as opposed to evolution toward preexisting fixed niches, shaped the communities. Using a model starting from random sets of founder species, we demonstrate that the patterns are indeed consistent with evolutionary self-organization. For less isolated habitats, the same model predicts the coexistence of multiple species in each regularly spaced functional group. Limiting similarity, therefore, may also be compatible with the coexistence of many redundant species.

Such populations are exposed to lower barometric pressures and hence atmospheric partial pressures of oxygen. Such hypobaric hypoxia may limit physical functional capacity, reproductive health, and even survival. As such, selection of genetic variants advantageous to hypoxic adaptation is likely to have occurred. Identifying signatures of such selection is likely to help understanding of hypoxic adaptive processes. Here, we seek evidence of such positive selection using five Ethiopian populations, three of which are from high-altitude areas in Ethiopia. As these populations may have been recipients of Eurasian gene flow, we correct for this admixture. Using single-nucleotide polymorphism genotype data from multiple populations, we find the strongest signal of selection in BHLHE41 (also known as December2 or SHARP1). ReMarchkably, a major role of this gene is regulation of the same hypoxia response pathway on which selection has most strikingly been observed in both Tibetan and Andean populations. Because it is also an important player in the circadian rhythm pathway, BHLHE41 might also provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the recognized impacts of hypoxia on the circadian clock. These results support the view that Ethiopian, Andean, and Tibetan populations living at high altitude have adapted to hypoxia differently, with convergent evolution affecting different genes from the same pathway.

Previous work demonstrated the existence of genetically distinct host races of this ectoparasite, occurring across its current range. The objective of the present study was to examine whether these host races have evolved measurable morphological differences. We measured a set of morphological variables on 255 non-engorged ticks (nymphs and adults) collected from three sympatrically occurring host species in the North Atlantic. Genotyping at eight microsatellite Marchkers enabled us to analyse the relationship between patterns of morphological and neutral genetic variation. Multivariate analyses showed that most morphological variation was associated with size differences among tick individuals. Body size differed among races, but only in adult life stages. A linear discriminant analysis based on shape variation revealed three distinct morphological clusters corresponding to the three tick host races. These results, along with correlated patterns of host-related genetic variation, suggest that differences among host-related groups are not simply the result of phenotypic plasticity or drift, but rather reflect host-associated adaptations. Experimental work and observations across the range of I.?uriae will now be required to test the genetic basis and adaptive nature of morphological differences.

We hypothesized that if the A. thaliana transcriptome is selected for a low nitrogen content, nitrogen-reducing derived alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) should segregate at higher frequencies than nitrogen-increasing alleles. This pattern should be stronger in populations with a larger effective population size (N-e) if natural selection is more efficient in large than in small populations. We analyzed variation in the nitrogen content in the transcriptome of 80 natural accessions of A. thaliana. In contrast to our expectations, derived alleles increase the nitrogen content in all accessions, and there is a positive correlation between nitrogen difference and derived allele frequency, which is strongest with nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs). Also, there is a positive correlation between nitrogen difference and N-e that was mainly caused by nsSNPs. These observations led us to reject the hypothesis that the transcriptome of A. thaliana is currently under selection to reduce nitrogen content. Instead, we show that a change in nitrogen content is a side effect of interacting evolutionary factors that influence base composition and include mutational bias, purifying selection of functionally deleterious alleles, and GC-biased gene conversion. We provide strong evidence that GC-biased gene conversion may play an important role for base composition in the highly selfing plant A. thaliana.

Here, we show that six of the seven sequenced ants have two copies of tra. Surprisingly, the two paralogues are always more similar within species than among species. Comparative sequence analyses indicate that this pattern is owing to the ongoing concerted evolution after an ancestral duplication rather than independent duplications in each of the six species. In particular, there was strong support for inter-locus recombination between the paralogues of the ant Atta cephalotes. In the five species where the location of paralogues is known, they are adjacent to each other in four cases and Septemberarated by only few genes in the fifth case. Because there have been extensive genomic rearrangements in these lineages, this suggests selection acting to conserve their synteny. In three species, we also find a signature of positive selection in one of the paralogues. In three bee species where information is available, the tra gene is also duplicated, the copies are adjacent and in at least one species there was recombination between paralogues. These results suggest that concerted evolution plays an adaptive role in the evolution of this gene family.

Here we present a model inspired by the volvocine green algae that explains the dynamics involved in the unicellular-multicellular transition using life-history theory and allometry. We model the two fitness components (fecundity and viability) and compare the fitness of hypothetical colonies of different sizes with varying degrees of cellular differentiation to understand the general principles that underlie the evolution of multicellularity. We argue that germ-soma Septemberaration may have evolved to counteract the increasing costs and requirements of larger multicellular colonies. The model shows that the cost of investing in soma Decemberreases with size. For lineages such as the Volvocales, as reproduction costs increase with size for undifferentiated colonies, soma specialization benefits the colony indirectly by Decemberreasing such costs and directly by helping reproductive cells acquire resources for their metabolic needs. Germ specialization is favored once soma evolves and takes care of vegetative functions. To illustrate the model, we use some allometric relationships measured in Volvocales. Our analysis shows that the cost of reproducing an increasingly larger group has likely played an important role in the transition to multicellularity and cellular differentiation.

The shape of the transmissionvirulence relationship predicts whether virulence should evolve toward either a maximum or to an intermediate optimum. A positive correlation between each of these traits and within-host growth is often suggested to underlie the relationship between virulence and transmission. There are few experimental tests of this hypothesis this study reports on the first empirical test on a plant pathogen. We infected Brassica rapa plants with nine natural isolates of Cauliflower mosaic virus and then estimated three traits: transmission, virulence, and within-host viral accumulation. As predicted by the trade-off hypothesis, we observed a positive correlation between transmission and virulence, suggestive of the existence of an intermediate optimum. We discovered the unexpected existence of two groups of within-host accumulation, differing by at least an order of magnitude. When accumulation groups were not accounted for, within-host accumulation was correlated neither to virulence nor transmission, although our results suggest that within each group these correlations exist.

Nonetheless, rhacophorid evolution, specially on Borneo, has not been studied within a phylogenetic context. In this study, we examine the phylogenetic relationships of 38 (out of 41) Bornean species of Rhacophoridae, in combination with data from previous phylogenetic studies. In the final super matrix of 91 species, we analyse sequence data from two mitochondria] and three nuclear genes. The resulting trees show the genus Rhacophorus as a paraphyletic assemblage. As a consequence, we transfer Rhacophorus appendiculatus and R. kajau to two other genera and propose the new phylogeny-based combinations- Kurixalus appendiculatus and Feihyla kajau, respectively. Furthermore, we use our phylogenetic hypotheses to reconstruct the evolution of reproductive modes in rhacophorid tree frogs. Direct development to the exclusion of a free larval stage evolved twice independently, once in an ancestor of the Pseudophilautus + Raorchestes clade in India and Sri Lanka, and once within Philautus in Southeast Asia. The deposition of egg clutches covered by a layer of jelly in Feihyla is also present in F. kajau and thus confirms our generic reassignment. The reMarchkably high diversity of rhacophorid tree frogs on Borneo is the outcome of a complex pattern of repeated vicariance and dispersal events caused by past changes in the climatic and geological history of the Sunda shelf. We identified geographic clades of closely related endemic species within Rhacophorus and Philautus, which result from local island radiations on Borneo. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Species extinction and the concomitant loss of branches from the tree-of-life is therefore a major conservation concern. There is increasing evidence indicating that extinction is phylogenetically non-random, such that if one species is vulnerable to extinction so too are its close relatives. However, the impact of non-random extinctions on the tree-of-life has been a matter of recent debate. Here, we combine simulations with empirical data on extinction risk in mammals. We demonstrate that phylogenetically clustered extinction leads to a disproportionate loss of branches from the tree-of-life, but that the loss of their summed lengths is indistinguishable from random extinction. We argue that under a speciational model of evolution, the number of branches lost might be of equal or greater consequences than the loss of summed branch lengths. We therefore suggest that the impact of non-random extinction on the tree-of-life may have been underestimated.

This system is also characterized by parallel de-domestication events, with two genetically distinct weedy rice biotypes in the US derived from the Asian domesticate. One important trait that has been altered by rice domestication and de-domestication is hull colour. The wild progenitors of the two cultivated rice species have predominantly black-coloured hulls, as does one of the two U.S. weed biotypes both cultivated species and one of the US weedy biotypes are characterized by straw-coloured hulls. Using Black hull 4 (Bh4) as a hull colour candidate gene, we examined DNA sequence variation at this locus to study the parallel evolution of hull colour variation in the domesticated and weedy rice system. We find that independent Bh4-coding mutations have arisen in African and Asian rice that are correlated with the straw hull phenotype, suggesting that the same gene is responsible for parallel trait evolution. For the U.S. weeds, Bh4 haplotype sequences support current hypotheses on the phylogenetic relationship between the two biotypes and domesticated Asian rice straw hull weeds are most similar to indica crops, and black hull weeds are most similar to aus crops. Tests for selection indicate that Asian crops and straw hull weeds deviate from neutrality at this gene, suggesting possible selection on Bh4 during both rice domestication and de-domestication.

To understand the evolutionary origin of HSP90A functional diversification, we analyzed the distribution of HSP90A family from 54 species representing the main eukaryotic lineages. Three independent HSP90A duplications led to the paralog subfamilies HSP90AA (heat-stress inducible) and HSP90AB (constitutive) and trace back to key time points during vertebrate, seed plant, and yeast evolution. HSP90AA and HSP90AB present divergent selection pressures, positive selection (PS), and signatures of functional divergence (FD) after duplication. The differential evolutionary patterns support different mechanisms for HSP90A functional diversification in vertebrates and seed plants. Mapping of PS and FD residues onto the HSP90A structure suggests the acquisition of Novemberel and/or specialized client protein and/or cochaperone binding functions. We propose these residues as targets for further experimental studies of HSP90A proteins, reported to be capacitors of rapid evolutionary change, and targets for anticancer therapeutics.

Bacteria release bacteriocins into the environment at a cost to individual cell, but individual bacteriocin-producing cells are unlikely to gain any direct benefit from their own toxin indeed, cell lysis is required in many species. There is a growing body of research describing the ecological conditions that can favour the evolution of bacteriocin production. However, an important aspect of many bacteriocins has yet to be investigated: the ability of bacteriocin-producing cells to neutralize toxin ('soaking') produced by other clonemates. By competing Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriocin-producing wild-type and 'non-soaking' strains against a bacteriocin-susceptible strain, we find that soaking Marchkedly reduces the fitness of a bacteriocin-producing strain at both high and low frequencies.

Studying exceptions to general patterns of dispersal, for example, FBD in mammals, provides a valuable opportunity to test the validity of proposed evolutionary pressures. We used long-term behavioural and genetic data on individually banded Proboscis bats (Rhynchonycteris naso) to show that this species is one of the rare mammalian exceptions with FBD. Our results suggest that all females disperse from their natal colonies prior to first reproduction and that a substantial proportion of males are philopatric and reproduce in their natal colonies, although male immigration has also been detected. The age of females at first conception falls below the tenure of males, suggesting that females disperse to avoid fatherdAugusthter inbreeding. Male philopatry in this species is intriguing because Proboscis bats do not share the usual mammalian correlates (i.e. resource-defence polygyny and/or kin cooperation) of male philopatry. They have a mating strategy based on female defence, where local mate competition between male kin is supposedly severe and should prevent the evolution of male philopatry. However, in contrast to immigrant males, philopatric males may profit from acquaintance with the natal foraging grounds and may be able to attain dominance easier and/or earlier in life. Our results on Proboscis bats lent additional support to the importance of inbreeding avoidance in shaping sex-biased dispersal patterns and suggest that resource defence by males or kin cooperation cannot fully explain the evolution of male philopatry in mammals.

Signal costs may make dishonesty prohibitively expensive, while genetic constraints could make it impossible. We investigated honest signaling using full-sib analysis and parent-offspring regression in the ant Lasius niger, in which queens produce a cuticular hydrocarbon-based pheromone that signals fertility and inhibits worker reproduction and aggression. We found multiple lines of evidence that cuticular hydrocarbon production is genetically correlated with oogenesis and that the queen pheromone 3-methylhentriacontane and other 3-methylalkanes have strong genetic links with fertility relative to other cuticular hydrocarbons. These genetic correlations may maintain honesty in the face of directional selection on signaling and explain the putatively widespread use of cuticular hydrocarbons in fertility signaling across the social insects. We also found evidence for a positive genetic correlation for fertility between the castes that is, the most fertile queens produced especially fertile workers. These results highlight that intercaste genetic correlations could constrain the evolution of queen-worker dimorphism, such that worker reproduction may sometimes reflect a nonadaptive caste load rather than positively selected cheating.

However, our understanding of the molecular changes that accompanied their emergence remains scarce. Here, we describe the evolutionary history of the SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) family, because its vertebrate orthologues are expressed in cartilage, bones and teeth where they have been proposed to bind calcium and act as extracellular collagen chaperones, and because further duplications of specific SPARC members produced the small calcium-binding phosphoproteins (SCPP) family that is crucial for skeletal mineralization to occur. Both phylogeny and synteny conservation analyses reveal that, in the eumetazoan ancestor, a unique ancestral gene duplicated to give rise to SPARC and SPARCB described here for the first time. Independent losses have eliminated one of the two paralogues in cnidarians, protostomes and tetrapods. Hence, only non-tetrapod deuterostomes have conserved both genes. ReMarchkably, SPARC and SPARCB paralogues are still linked in the amphioxus genome. To shed light on the evolution of the SPARC family members in chordates, we performed a comprehensive analysis of their embryonic expression patterns in amphioxus, tunicates, teleosts, amphibians and mammals. Our results show that in the chordate lineage SPARC and SPARCB family members were recurrently recruited in a variety of unrelated tissues expressing collagen genes. We propose that one of the earliest steps of skeletal evolution involved the co-expression of SPARC paralogues with collagenous proteins.

Evidence from the amphibian Decemberlines in Central America	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES	amphibian Decemberlines chytridiomycosis virulence epidemiology hierarchical Bayesian model host-pathogen	BATRACHOCHYTRIUM-DENDROBATIDIS COSTA-RICA POPULATION DecemberLINES CLIMATE-CHANGE SEASONAL-VARIATION TROPICAL MOUNTAIN FUNGAL PATHOGEN RANGE EXPANSION CHYTRID FUNGUS GLOBAL CLIMATE	The virulence of a pathogen can vary strongly through time. While cyclical variation in virulence is regularly observed, directional shifts in virulence are less commonly observed and are typically associated with Decemberreasing virulence of biological control agents through coevolution. It is increasingly appreciated, however, that spatial effects can lead to evolutionary trajectories that differ from standard expectations. One such possibility is that, as a pathogen spreads through a naive host population, its virulence increases on the invasion front. In Central America, there is compelling evidence for the recent spread of pathogenic Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and for its strong impact on amphibian populations. Here, we re-examine data on Bd prevalence and amphibian population Decemberline across 13 sites from southern Mexico through Central America, and show that, in the initial phases of the Bd invasion, amphibian population Decemberline lagged approximately 9 years behind the arrival of the pathogen, but that this lag diminished Marchkedly over time. In total, our analysis suggests an increase in Bd virulence as it spread southwards, a pattern consistent with rapid evolution of increased virulence on Bd's invading front. The impact of Bd on amphibians might therefore be driven by rapid evolution in addition to more proximate environmental drivers.

We used next-generation sequencing to generate mitochondrial genome data comprising 12 protein coding genes for 27 taxa. Together with two published ingroup sequences, (sub)family relationships were assessed with Bayesian and ML searches under various models and partitioning schemes. Forward and reverse strands of the mitochondrial genome differed in nucleotide skew. Consequently synonymous codon usage differed substantially on either strand for each amino acid, whereby codons ending in AT and GC were favored on the forward and reverse strands, respectively. Data partitioning by forward/reverse strand and codon position greatly improved likelihood scores and nodal support, whereas the tree topology was largely stable. The analysis generally supports the basal position of several 'orthocerus' lineages with straight antennae and male genitalia of an ancestral type a paraphyletic mixed group of Heteromorphi exhibiting mixed ancestral and derived antennal and genitalic characters and the derived 'gonathocerous' lineages with kinked antennae corresponding to the strongly supported Curculionidae. The latter did not include the wood boring Platypodinae that was recovered as sister to Dryophthoridae, while the Scolytinae and Cossoninae formed two independent lineages of wood borers within Curculionidae. A basal split in Curculionidae placed the Entiminae and Hyperinae as sister to all other subfamilies with high support, which provides a new ecological concept for structuring the Curculionidae according to the ectophagous larval life style in the former versus endophagous larvae in all others. This basal split is also supported by gene order rearrangements in a tRNA cluster. Recent studies supporting the monophyly of wood boring weevils may be attributable to long-branch attraction, as molecular rates in their mitochondrial genomes were found to be higher than in other lineages, but this did not confound tree searches under combined analysis of mitochondrial protein coding genes.

We collected 4409 bp of DNA from three mitochondrial (cyt-b, ND2, D-loop) and two nuclear (RAG1, RAG2) sequences from 138 individuals representing all but two recognized species of Sturnira and five other phyllostomid bats used as outgroups. The sequence data were subjected to maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference analyses. Results overwhelmingly support the monophyly of the genus Sturnira but not continued recognition of Corvira as a subgenus the two species (bidens and nana) allocated to that group constitute Septemberarate, basal branches on the phylogeny. A total of 21 monophyletic putatively species-level groups were recovered pairs were Septemberarated by an average 7.09% (SD = 1.61) pairwise genetic distance in cyt-b, and three of these groups are apparently unnamed. Several well-supported clades are evident, including a complex of seven species formerly confused with S. lilium, a species that is actually limited to the Brazilian Shield. We used four calibration points to construct a time-tree for Sturnira, using BEAST. Sturnira diverged from other stenodermatines in the mid-Miocene, and by the end of that epoch (5.3 Ma), three basal lineages were present. Most living species belong to one of two clades, A and B, which appeared and diversified shortly afterwards, during the Pliocene. Both parsimony (DIVA) and likelihood (Lagrange) methods for reconstructing ancestral ranges indicate that the radiation of Sturnira is rooted in the Andes all three basal lineages (in order, bidens, nana, and aratathomasi) have strictly or mainly Andean distributions. Only later did Sturnira colonize the Pacific lowlands (Choco) and thence Central America. Sturnira species that are endemic to Central America appeared after the final emergence of the Panamanian landbridge 3 Ma. Despite its ability to fly and to colonize the Antilles overwater, this genus probably accompanied the legions of South American taxa that moved overland during the Great American Biotic Interchange. Its eventual colonization of the Lesser Antilles and the appearance of two endemic lineages there did not take place until the Pleistocene. Because of its continual residence and diversification in South America, Andean assemblages of Sturnira contain both basal and highly derived members of the genus. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Here we present the first data-based model of evolutionary diversification along a continuous environmental gradient. On the basis of genetic analyses, it has been suggested that a pair of coregonid fishes (Coregonus spp.) in a postglacial German lake originated by sympatric speciation. Within this lake, the two species segregate vertically and show metabolic adaptations to, as well as behavioral preferences for, correspondingly different temperatures. We test the plausibility of the hypothesis that this diversifying process has been driven by adaptations to different thermal microhabitats along the lake''s temperature-depth gradient. Using an adaptive-dynamics model that is calibrated with empirical data and allows the gradual evolution of a quantitative trait describing optimal foraging temperature, we show that under the specific environmental conditions in the lake, evolutionary branching of a hypothetical ancestral population into two distinct phenotypes may have occurred. We also show that the resultant evolutionary diversification yields two stably coexisting populations with trait values and depth distributions that are in agreement with those currently observed in the lake. We conclude that divergent thermal adaptations along the temperature-depth gradient might have brought about the two species observed today.

Yet, intraspecific comparisons between selfing and outcrossing populations are few and provide only mixed support for this key evolutionary process. We estimated ID for large-flowered (LF), predominantly outcrossing vs. small-flowered (SF), predominantly selfing populations of the dune endemic Camissoniopsis cheiranthifolia by comparing selfed and crossed progeny in glasshouse environments differing in soil moisture, and by comparing allozyme-based estimates of the proportion of seeds selfed and inbreeding coefficient of mature plants. Based on lifetime measures of dry mass and flower production, ID was stronger in nine LF populations [mean =1(fitness of selfed seed/fitness of outcrossed seed)=0.39] than 16 SF populations (mean =0.03). However, predispersal ID during seed maturation was not stronger for LF populations, and ID was not more pronounced under simulated drought, a pervasive stress in sand dune habitat. Genetic estimates of were also higher for four LF (=1.23) than five SF (=0.66) populations however, broad confidence intervals around these estimates overlapped. These results are consistent with purging, but selective interference among loci may be required to maintain strong ID in partially selfing LF populations, and trade-offs between selfed and outcrossed fitness are likely required to maintain outcrossing in SF populations.

If there is little chance of reproducing again, then males should invest heavily in current offspring, regardless of their share in paternity. We tested this by manipulating male age and paternity assurance in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. We found older males invested more in both mating effort and parental effort than younger males. Furthermore, male age, a component of male state, mediated male response to perceived paternity. Older males provided more prenatal care, whereas younger males provided less prenatal care, when perceived paternity was low. Adjustments in male care, however, did not influence selection acting indirectly on parents, through offspring performance. This is because females adjusted their care in response to the age of their partner, providing less care when paired with older males than younger males. As a result offspring, performance did not differ between treatments. Our study shows, for the first time, that a male state variable is an important modifier of paternity-parental care trade-offs and highlights the importance of social interactions between males and females during care in determining male response to perceived paternity.

Empirical evidence for sex linkage has come largely from crosses and few studies have examined how sexual dimorphism and sex linkage are related within outbred populations. Here, we use data on an array of different traits measured on over 10,000 individuals from two pedigreed populations of birds (collared flycatcher and zebra finch) to estimate the amount of sex-linked genetic variance (h2z). Of 17 traits examined, eight showed a nonzero h2Z estimate but only four were significantly different from zero (wing patch size and tarsus length in collared flycatchers, wing length and beak color in zebra finches). We further tested how sexual dimorphism and the mode of selection operating on the trait relate to the proportion of sex-linked genetic variance. Sexually selected traits did not show higher h2Z than morphological traits and there was only a weak positive relationship between h2Z and sexual dimorphism. However, given the relative scarcity of empirical studies, it is premature to make conclusions about the role of sex chromosome linkage in the evolution of sexual dimorphism.

The stress response has formed as a result of natural selection, improving the capacity of organisms to withstand situations that require action. The ubiquity of the cellular stress response suggests that effective mechanisms to counteract stress emerged early in the history of life, and their commonality proves how vital such mechanisms are to operative evolution. The cellular stress response (CSR) has been identified as a characteristic of cells in all three domains of life and consists of a core 44 proteins that are structurally highly conserved and that have been termed the minimal stress proteome' (MSP). Within the MSP, the most intensely researched proteins are a family of heat-shock proteins known as HSP70. Superficially, correlations between the induction of stress and HSP70 differential expression support the use of HSP70 expression as a nonspecific bioMarchker of stress. However, we argue that too often authors have failed to question exactly what HSP70 differential expression signifies. Herein, we argue that HSP70 up-regulation in response to stressors has been shown to be far more complex than the commonly accepted quasi-linear relationship. In addition, in many instances, the uncertain identity and function of heat-shock proteins and heat-shock cognates has led to difficulties in interpretation of reports of inducible heat-shock proteins and constitutive heat-shock cognates. We caution against the broad application of HSP70 as a bioMarchker of stress in isolation and conclude that the application of HSP70 as a meaningful index of stress requires a higher degree of validation than the majority of research currently undertakes.

We contrast polyploidy with pseudopolyploidy, highlighting when it is crucial to look at genetic vs. genomic levels. We review history of pseudopolyploidy, including recent mechanisms by which chromosomal bifurcation may occur and outline methods for detecting such genomic changes. We then delve into the evolutionary implications, with particular focus on adaptive potential, of these two forms of doubling chromosome numbers. We address the common assertion that polyploidy induces adaptive radiations, which contains three fallacies. First, while polyploidy causes quantum speciation, evolutionary theory implies that these radiations should be non-adaptive. Polyploidy causes reproductive isolation, minute effective population sizes, and increased mutation rates, which all imply a diminished role for selection. Second, due to lack of karyotyping in recent Decemberades and lack of distinction between genomic and genetic effects, it is usually impossible to detect pseudopolyploids. Third, pseudopolyploids lack minority cytotype exclusion because they readily backcross with their progenitors, which thereby means no reproductive isolation for newly formed pseudopolyploids. Pseudopolyploidy will thereby not result in radiations until pseudopolyploid descendants undergo subsequent chromosome rearrangements or grow new centromeres. Pseudopolyploids may have a modest selective advantage over their progenitors due to diminished linkage disequilibrium. Thus, pseudopolyploidy may induce adaptive non-radiations. We encourage a renaissance of karyotyping to distinguish between these two mechanisms and a renaissance in genomic perspectives in evolution. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.) 320B:286-294, 2013.

A number of hypotheses based on the forces of mutation and selection have been proposed to explain this variation. Among such hypotheses, we test three: 1) the longevity-dependent selection', 2) the functional constraints' and 3) the race for replication' hypotheses, using published mtDNA genomic sequences of 47 Nematoda species. We did not find any relationship between body size (used as a proxy for longevity) and genome size or the substitution rate of protein sequences, providing little evidence for the first hypothesis. Parasitic species from different thermal habitats, as determined by their definitive host type (ectothermal vs. endothermal), did not differ in their rates of protein evolution. Therefore, little support was obtained for the second hypothesis. However, we revealed that mitogenomes of parasites of endotherms were significantly smaller than those of parasites of ectotherms, supporting the race for replication hypothesis. As mitochondrial genomes of endothermal animals are usually more compact than those of ectothermal animals, intriguingly, nematode parasites of endotherms and ectotherms exhibit similar patterns of mtDNA length variation to their hosts.

This controversial subject extends to several species of fish. In this study, three species of the Sparidae family (Pagrus pagrus, P. auriga and Diplodus sargus) and an interspecific hybrid (P. pagrus (a (TM) Euro) x P. auriga (a (TM),)) have been studied at both molecular and cytogenetic level, taking three different multigene families (5S rDNA, 45S rDNA and U2 snDNA). Results obtained with the 5S rDNA in P. pagrus and P. auriga are characterized by a considerable degree of conservation at the two levels however, an extraordinary variation was observed in D. sargus at the two levels, which has never been found in other fishes studied to date. As a consequence of this, the evolutionary model of the multigene families is discussed considering the results obtained and others from the bibliography. The result obtained in the hybrid allowed the recombination frequency in each multigene family to be estimated.

Based on univariate measures of adaptive capacity, it has recently been suggested that species may have limited evolutionary potential to extend their upper thermal limits under ramping temperature conditions that better reflect heat stress in nature. To test these findings more broadly, we used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to estimate the multivariate evolutionary potential for upper thermal limits in Drosophila simulans. We assessed heat tolerance using static (basal and hardened) and ramping assays. Our analyses revealed significant evolutionary potential for all three measures of heat tolerance. Additive genetic variances were significantly different from zero for all three traits. Our G matrix analysis revealed that all three traits would contribute to a response to selection for increased heat tolerance. Significant additive genetic covariances and additive genetic correlations between static basal and hardened heat-knockdown time, Marchginally nonsignificant between static basal and ramping heat-knockdown time, indicate that direct and correlated responses to selection for increased upper thermal limits are possible. Thus, combinations of all three traits will contribute to the evolution of upper thermal limits in response to selection imposed by a warming climate. Reliance on univariate estimates of evolutionary potential may not provide accurate insight into the ability of organisms to evolve upper thermal limits in nature.

We investigated 11 subterranean and seven surface populations of Sundathelphusa freshwater crabs on Bohol Island, Philippines, and examined constructive traits associated with improved food finding in darkness (increased leg and setae length) and reductive traits (reduced cornea size and eyestalk length). All changes occurred rapidly, given that the age of the most recent common ancestor was estimated to be 722-271 ka based on three mitochondrial Marchkers. In order to quantify the speed of character change, we correlated the degree of morphological change with genetic distances between surface and subterranean individuals. The temporal pattern of character change following the transition to subterranean life was indistinguishable for constructive and reductive traits, characterized by an immediate onset and rapid evolutionary change. We propose that the evolution of these reductive traits-just like constructive traits-is most likely driven by strong directional selection.

Ascyreia (H. calycinum L.), H. sect. Heterophyllum (H. heterophyllum Vent.), H. Sect. Taeniocarpium (Hypericum confertum Choisy subsp. confertum, H. venustum Fenzl, H. linaroides Bosse), H. sect. Drosocarpium (H. montbretii Spach, H. bithynicum Boiss.), H. sect. Crossophyllum (H. adenotrichum Spach, H. orientale L.), H. sect. Olympia (H. olympicum L. subsp. olympicum), H. sect. Origanifolia (H. origanifolium Willd., H. avicularifolium Jaub and Spach subsp. depilatum (Freyn and Bornm.) Robson var. depilatum, H. avicularifolium Jaub. and Spach subsp. byzantinum) and H. sect. Hypericum (H. tetrapterum Fries, H. perforatum L., H. triquetrifolium Tura). These taxa were studied under light microscope and scanning electron microscope for the first time. Of the taxa studied, H. tetrapterum has the smallest pollen grains (on average 15.85-17.20 x 15.45-16.05 mu m) and H. olympicum subsp. olympicum the largest grains (on average 22.90-23.10 x 21.40-22.10 mu m). The pollen grains of 15 taxa are subprolate and one taxon is prolate-spheroidal. The regular pollen grains of all 16 taxa are 3-zonocolporate. Ornamentation is microreticulate lumina regularly spaced in eight taxa, tectum perforatum tectal perforations regularly spaced in seven taxa and tectum perforatum and tectal perforations grouped together in one taxon. Endoaperture is cruciform porus, with short lateral and meridional extensions in ten taxa, cruciform porus, transversally elongated, with very small lateral extensions in one taxon and lalongate colpus in five taxa. Basic pollen types are ten taxa in type X, five taxa in type IV and one taxon in type II.

Associations are characterized within and between variables such as upper and lower canine height beyond the occlusal plane (canine overlap), maximum jaw gape, and jaw length for 27 adult catarrhine species, including 539 living subjects and 316 museum specimens. The data demonstrate that most adult male catarrhines have relatively larger canine overlap dimensions and gapes than do conspecific females. For example, whereas male baboons open their jaws maximally more than 110% of jaw length, females open about 90%. Humans and hylobatids are the exceptions in that canine overlap is nearly the same in both the sexes and so is relative gape (ca. 65% for humans and 110% for hylobatids). A correlation analysis demonstrates that a large portion of relative gape (maximum gape/projected jaw length) is predicted by relative canine overlap (canine overlap/jaw length). Relative gape is mainly a function of jaw muscle position and/or jaw muscle-fiber length. All things equal, more rostrally positioned jaw muscles and/or shorter muscle fibers Decemberrease gape and increase bite force during the power stroke of mastication, and the net benefit is to increase the mechanical efficiency during chewing. Similarly, more caudally positioned muscles and/or longer muscle fibers increase the amount of gape and Decemberrease bite force. Overall, the data support the hypothesis that canine reduction in early hominins is functionally linked to Decemberreased gape and increased mechanical efficiency of the jaws.

Chromosome location and similarity of exon-intron structures suggest that the family evolved by duplications. The initial duplication of ancestral proto-GTF2IRD1 gene likely occurred in early vertebrates prior to origin of cartilaginous fish and led to formation of GTF2I (> 450 MYA), which was later lost in bony fish but successfully evolved in the land vertebrates. The second duplication event, which created GTF2IRD2, occurred prior to major radiation events of eutherian mammalian evolution (> 100 MYA). During recent steps of primate evolution there was another duplication which led to formation of GTF2IRD2B (< 4 MYA). Two latest duplications were coupled with inversions. Genes belonging to the family have several highly conservative repeats which are implicated in DNA binding. Phylogenetic analysis of the repeats revealed a pattern of intragenic duplications, deletions and substitutions which led to diversification of the genes and proteins. Distribution of statistically rare atypical substitutions (p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.01) sheds some light on structural differentiation of repeats and hence evolution of the genes. The atypical substitutions are often located on secondary structures joining alpha-helices and affect 3D arrangement of the protein globule. Such substitutions are commonly traced at the early stages of evolution in Tetrapoda, Amniota, and Mammalia.	June 22, 2013Natural selection. VI. Partitioning the information in fitness and characters by path analysis	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY	information theory kin selection mathematical models path analysis population genetics	FISHERS FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM KIN SELECTION STRUCTURED POPULATIONS PRICE EQUATION MODEL GENETICS SYMBIOSIS EVOLUTION	Three steps aid in the analysis of selection. First, describe phenotypes by their component causes. Components include genes, maternal effects, symbionts and any other predictors of phenotype that are of interest. Second, describe fitness by its component causes, such as an individual's phenotype, its neighbours' phenotypes, resource availability and so on. Third, put the predictors of phenotype and fitness into an exact equation for evolutionary change, providing a complete expression of selection and other evolutionary processes. The complete expression Septemberarates the distinct causal roles of the various hypothesized components of phenotypes and fitness. Traditionally, those components are given by the covariance, variance and regression terms of evolutionary models. I show how to interpret those statistical expressions with respect to information theory. The resulting interpretation allows one to read the fundamental equations of selection and evolution as sentences that express how various causes lead to the accumulation of information by selection and the Decemberay of information by other evolutionary processes. The interpretation in terms of information leads to a deeper understanding of selection and heritability, and a clearer sense of how to formulate causal hypotheses about evolutionary process. Kin selection appears as a particular type of causal analysis that partitions social effects into meaningful components.

We develop new likelihood-based models to test diversity-dependent evolution in the auks, one of only a few families of seabirds adapted to underwater flight, and which exhibit a large variety of bill sizes and shapes. Consistent with the expectations of adaptive radiation, we find both a Decemberline in rates of cladogenesis (a sixfold Decemberline) and bill shape (a 64-fold Decemberline) evolution as diversity increased. Bill shape diverged into two clades at the basal cladogenesis event with one clade possessing mostly long, narrow bills used to forage priMarchily on fish, and the other with short thick bills used to forage priMarchily on plankton. Following this initial divergence in bill shape, size, a known correlate of both prey size and maximum diving depth, diverged rapidly within each of these clades. These results suggest that adaptive radiation in foraging traits underwent initial divergence in bill shape to occupy different food resources, followed by size differentiation to subdivide each niche along the depth axis of the water column.

Although population differences in timing of maturation have been frequently reported in studies of wild animal populations, little is known about the genetic basis of this differentiation. Here, we investigated population and sex differences in timing of maturation within and between two nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) populations in a laboratory breeding experiment. We found that fish from the high-predation Marchine population matured earlier than fish from the low-predation pond population and males matured earlier than females. Timing of maturation in both reciprocal hybrid crosses between the two populations was similar to that in the Marchine population, suggesting that early timing of maturation is a dominant trait, whereas delayed timing of maturation in the pond is a recessive trait. Thus, the observed population divergence is suggestive of strong natural selection against early maturation in the piscine-predator-free pond population.

But can the biosphere as a whole tip and, if so, how? Past global tipping points were rare and occurred in the coupled planetary-scale dynamics of the Earth system, not in the local-scale dynamics of its weakly interacting component ecosystems. Yet, evolutionary inNovemberations have triggered past global transformations, suggesting that tipping point theory needs to go beyond bifurcations and networks to include evolution.

Our analyses revealed a well-resolved phylogenetic hypothesis, again recovering the six previously recognized families within NOctoberuoidea (i.e. Oenosandridae, Notodontidae, Euteliidae, Erebidae, Nolidae and NOctoberuidae), and monophyly of the quadrifid NOctoberuoidea (i.e. Euteliidae, Erebidae, Nolidae and NOctoberuidae). The family Nolidae is diagnosed and characterized by two synapomorphies from morphology: construction of a ridged boat-shaped cocoon that bears a vertical exit slit at one end and two other morphological character states: elongation of the forewing retinaculum into a bar-like or digitate condition and possession of a postpiracular counter-tympanal hood. We present a new phylogenetic hypothesis for Nolidae consisting of eight strongly supported subfamilies, two of which are erected here: Diphtherinae, Risobinae, Collomeninae subfam. November., Beaninae subfam. November., Eligminae, Westermanniinae, Nolinae and Chloephorinae. Where we are able, each monophyletic lineage is diagnosed by morphological autapomorphies and within each subfamily, monophyletic tribes and subtribes are circumscribed, most of which are also diagnosable by morphological apomorphies. We also describe two new taxa: Gelastocerini trib. November. and Etannina subtrib. November. The Neotropical subfamily Diphtherinae, here newly circumscribed, is considered to be the plesiomorphic sister lineage to the rest of Nolidae. Diphtherinae are characterized by loss of the proximal pair of metatibial spurs in males and by the presence of a frontal tubercle, which is presumably associated with a derived strategy of emergence from the cocoon.

Being based on different approaches, these tests are generally thought to possess quite different statistical performances. In this article, we show that the Blomberg et al. K and K*, the Abouheif index, the Moran's I, and the Mantel correlation are all based on a cross-product statistic, and are thus all related to each other when they are associated to a permutation test of phylogenetic signal. What changes is only the way phylogenetic and trait similarities (or dissimilarities) among the tips of a phylogeny are computed. The definitions of the phylogenetic and trait-based (dis)similarities among tips thus determines the performance of the tests. We shortly discuss the biological and statistical consequences (in terms of power and type I error of the tests) of the observed relatedness among the statistics that allow tests for phylogenetic signal. Blomberg et al. K* statistic appears as one on the most efficient approaches to test for phylogenetic signal. When branch lengths are not available or not accurate, Abouheif's Cmean statistic is a powerful alternative to K*.

In the model, megagametophytes may continue to grow until seed completion or may cease to grow at a certain time and regrow at pollination or fertilization. Autonomous abortion of unpollinated or unfertilized megagametophytes may occur either at pollination or fertilization. Those megagametophytes absorb a certain amount of resources before abortion, due to constraints in the signal process, in addition to the resources absorbed before pollination or fertilization. It was found that both growth habits can be the ESS: megagametophytes continue to grow without cessation and monopolize resources, such as gymnosperms, or cease to grow until fertilization to reduce the loss of resources due to autonomous abortion, such as angiosperms. The former and the latter are the ESS if the time interval between pollination and fertilization is long and short, respectively. Thus, the fertilization interval may be a critical factor selecting for large megagametophytes of gymnosperms or tiny ones of angiosperms.

However, most knowledge of plant-herbivore associations is derived from observations of adults. One reason for this bias is that species identification of immature stages is usually challenging. DNA barcodes can be used to identify immature stages to the species level. This technique compares short sequences of the appropriate DNA barcode loci [e.g. mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene for insects] of an unidentified specimen with a known DNA barcode library. The accuracy of DNA-based identifications depends on the comprehensiveness of the DNA barcode library. We generated a comprehensive DNA barcode library for a community of rolled-leaf beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in a premontane tropical forest in Costa Rica. The DNA barcode COI accurately identified all beetle species included in the study. Using this DNA barcode library, we identified eggs and larvae of Cephaloleia histrionicaBaly with 100% confidence. This new record of C.histrionica is unique in that this species completes its life cycle on a bromeliad, whereas most Cephaloleia species are associated with plants from the order Zingiberales. The life cycle, diet breadth, immature stages, and sexual dimorphism are described for C.histrionica.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 189-198.

Evolutionary signatures of functional shifts could be detected by comparing noncoding regions that are highly conserved across mammals or primates and rapidly accumulated nucleotide substitutions only in the lineage leading to humans. As gene loci densely populated with human-accelerated elements (HAEs) are more likely to have contributed to human-specific Novemberelties, we sought to identify the transcriptional units and genomic 1 Mb intervals of the entire human genome carrying the highest number of HAEs. To this end, we took advantage of four available data sets of human genomic accelerated regions obtained through different comparisons and algorithms and performed a meta-analysis of the combined data. We found that the brain developmental transcription factor neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 3 (NPAS3) contains the largest cluster of noncoding-accelerated regions in the human genome with up to 14 elements that are highly conserved in mammals, including primates, but carry human-specific nucleotide substitutions. We then tested the ability of the 14 HAEs identified at the NPAS3 locus to act as transcriptional regulatory sequences in a reporter expression assay performed in transgenic zebrafish. We found that 11 out of the 14 HAEs present in NPAS3 act as transcriptional enhancers during development, particularly within the nervous system. As NPAS3 is known to play a crucial role during mammalian brain development, our results indicate that the high density of HAEs present in the human NPAS3 locus could have modified the spatiotemporal expression pattern of NPAS3 in the developing human brain and, therefore, contributed to human brain evolution.

Using a quartet-tree framework, we measured the frequency of a rogue taxa effect in three data sets of increasing genetic variability (within viral serotype, between viral serotype, and between viral family) to test whether the rogue taxa was correlated with the mean sequence diversity of the respective data sets. We found a slight increase in the percentage of rogues as nucleotide diversity increased. Even though the number of rogues increased with diversity, the distribution of the types of rogues (friendly, crazy, or evil) did not depend on the diversity and in the case of the order-level data set the net rogue effect was slightly positive. This study, assessing frequency of the rogue taxa effect using biological data, indicated that simulation studies may over-predict the prevalence of the rogue taxa effect. Further investigations are necessary to understand which types of data sets are susceptible to a negative rogue effect and thus merit the removal of taxa from large phylogenetic reconstructions.

Great divergence in the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) with no genetic admixture in nuclear Marchkers indicated that creeping- and jelly-fig wasps are genetically distinct. Compared with creeping-fig wasps, jelly-fig wasps also showed better resistance under cold (20 degrees C) than warm (25 and 30 degrees C) conditions in a survival test, indicating their adaptation to a cold environment, which may have facilitated population expansion during the ice age as shown by a nuclear intron and 10 microsatellite loci. An excess of amino acid divergence and a pattern of too many rare mtCOI variants of jelly-fig wasps as revealed by computer simulations and neutrality tests implied the effect of positive selection, which we hypothesize was associated with the cold-adaptation process. Chloroplast DNA of the two fig plants was completely segregated, with signs of genetic admixture in nuclear Marchkers. As creeping- and jelly-fig wasps can pollinate creeping figs, occasional gene flow between the two figs is thus possible. Therefore, it is suggested that pollinating wasps may be playing an active role in driving introgression between different types of host fig.

Sexual dichromatism was found to be significantly positively associated with female reproductive effort in 21 phylogenetically independent matched-pair comparisons in the subfamily Anatinae, and this result could not be explained by body mass differences alone. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased female reproductive effort increases competition among males for access to females and thus the strength of sexual selection.

Here, we investigate the feeding ecology of the extinct large-bodied ursid Agriotherium africanum, by comparing its root surface areas (reconstructed with the aid of computed tomography and three-dimensional image processing) and bite force estimates, with those of extant carnivorans. Results show that in absolute terms, canine and carnassial bite forces, as well as root surface areas were highest in A. africanum. However, when adjusted for skull size, A. africanum's canine roots were smaller than those of extant solitary predators. With teeth being the limiting factor in the masticatory system, low canine root surface areas suggest that A. africanum would have struggled to bring down large vertebrate prey. Its adjusted carnassial root sizes were found to be smaller than those of extant hard object feeders and the most carnivorous tough object feeders, but larger than those of extant omnivorous ursids and Ursus Marchitimus. This and the fact that it displayed its highest postcanine root surface areas in the carnassial region (rather than the most distal tooth in the tooth row) suggest that A. africanum consumed more vertebrate tissue than extant omnivorous ursids. With an apparent inability to routinely bring down large prey or to consume mechanically demanding skeletal elements, its focus was most likely on tough tissue, which it acquired by actively scavenging the carcasses of freshly dead/freshly killed animals. Mechanically less demanding skeletal elements would have been a secondary food source, ingested and processed mainly in association with muscle and connective tissue.

In this study, we introduce a concise new method that selectively sequences from the 5'-end of mRNA and used it to identify TSS in four Drosophila species, including Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. pseudoobscura. For verification, we compared our results in D. melanogaster with known annotations, published 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends data, and with RNAseq from the same mRNA pool. Then, we paired 2,849 D. melanogaster TSS with its closest equivalent TSS in each species (likely to be its true ortholog) using the available multiple sequence alignments. Most of the D. melanogaster TSSs were successfully paired with an ortholog in each species (83%, 86%, and 55% for D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. pseudoobscura, respectively). On the basis of the number and distribution of reads mapped at each TSS, we also estimated promoter-specific expression (PSE) and TSS peak shape, respectively. Among paired TSS orthologs, the location and promoter activity were largely conserved. TSS location appears important as PSE, and TSS peak shape was more frequently divergent among TSS that had moved. Unpaired TSS were surprisingly common in D. pseudoobscura. An increased mutation rate upstream of TSS might explain this pattern. We found an enrichment of ribosomal protein genes among diverged TSS, suggesting that TSS evolution is not uniform across the genome.

TEs have been particularly effective in colonizing mammalian genomes, and such heavy TE load is expected to have conditioned genome evolution. Indeed, studies conducted both at the gene and genome levels have uncovered TE insertions that seem to have been co-opted-or exapted-by providing transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) that serve as promoters and enhancers, leading to the hypothesis that TE exaptation is a major factor in the evolution of gene regulation. Here, we critically review the evidence for exaptation of TE-derived sequences as TFBSs, promoters, enhancers, and silencers/insulators both at the gene and genome levels. We classify the functional impact attributed to TE insertions into four categories of increasing complexity and argue that so far very few studies have conclusively demonstrated exaptation of TEs as transcriptional regulatory regions. We also contend that many genome-wide studies dealing with TE exaptation in recent lineages of mammals are still inconclusive and that the hypothesis of rapid transcriptional regulatory rewiring mediated by TE mobilization must be taken with caution. Finally, we suggest experimental approaches that may help attributing higher-order functions to candidate exapted TEs.

The overall capacity of such Junek DNA' to induce mutations and foster the reorganization of functional genomes suggests that TE may be of central evolutionary significance. However, to what extent TE dynamics drive and is driven by the evolutionary trajectory of host taxa remains poorly known. Further work addressing the fate of TE insertions in natural populations is necessary to shed light on their impact on microevolutionary processes. Here, we highlight methodological approaches (i.e. transposon displays and high-throughput sequencing), tracking TE insertions across large numbers of individuals and discuss their pitfalls and benefits for molecular ecology surveys.

This study links evidence for treponematosis in skeletons from the 14th16th century AD cemetery of the Augustustinian friary of Hull Magistrates Court, England, with data from stable isotope analysis to test the hypothesis that the people with treponemal disease buried at this site were not locally born and raised. The objective is to explore the potential of using stable isotope data to track the place of origin and extent of mobility of individuals with an infectious disease. Dental enamel samples of 12 skeletons were selected for strontium (87Sr/86Sr ratio) and oxygen (d18O) stable isotope analysis based on the presence (six - diseased) or absence (six - controls) of bone changes associated with treponemal disease. The oxygen isotope ratios of all but three individuals (1047, 1121, 823) overlapped at two standard deviations with the inferred local precipitation range, and only one individual (1216) had a strontium isotope ratio outside the regional range. Two of the four had probable/possible treponemal bone changes. Those with treponemal bone changes were not demonstrably more likely to be migrants than those without such lesions. However, because of extensive documentary evidence for trade with the Baltic Sea area, and for merchants from towns such as Stralsund, Danzig and Elbing being in Hull, it is very plausible that the four migrants came from the Baltic area or even southern Sweden.

Recent advances in the genomics of the causative agents of TB, bacteria known as the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), have allowed a better comprehension of its population structure and provided the foundation for molecular evolution analyses. These studies are crucial for a better understanding of TB, including the variation of vaccine efficacy and disease outcome, together with the emergence of drug resistance. Starting from the analysis of 73 publicly available genomes from all the main MTBC lineages, we have screened for evidences of positive selection, a set of 576 genes previously associated with drug resistance or encoding membrane proteins. As expected, because antibiotics constitute strong selective pressure, some of the codons identified correspond to the position of confirmed drug-resistance-associated substitutions in the genes embB, rpoB, and katG. Furthermore, we identified diversifying selection in specific codons of the genes Rv0176 and Rv1872c coding for MCE1-associated transmembrane protein and a putative l-lactate dehydrogenase, respectively. Amino acid sequence analyses showed that in Rv0176, sites undergoing diversifying selection were in a predicted antigen region that varies between modern lineages and ancient MTBC/BCG strains. In Rv1872c, some of the sites under selection are predicted to impact protein function and thus might result from metabolic adaptation. These results illustrate that diversifying selection in MTBC is happening as a consequence of both antibiotic treatment and other evolutionary pressures.

The metatroch has been reported to have different cellular origins in the molluscs Crepidula fornicata and Ilyanassa obsoleta, as well as in the annelid Polygordius lacteus, consistent with multiple independent origins of the spiralian metatroch. Here, we describe in further detail the cell lineage of the ciliary bands in the gastropod mollusc I. obsoleta using intracellular lineage tracing and the expression of an acetylated tubulin antigen that serves as a Marchker for ciliated cells. We find that the I. obsoleta metatroch is formed priMarchily by third quartet derivatives as well as a small number of second quartet derivatives. These results differ from the described metatrochal lineage in the mollusc C. fornicata that derives solely from the second quartet or the metatrochal lineage in the annelid P. lacteus that derives solely from the third quartet. The present study adds to a growing body of literature concerning the evolution of the metatroch and the plasticity of cell fates in homologous micromeres in spiralian embryos.

This trait significantly influences the ecological and genetic structure of populations, and in consequence the evolution of species. The priMarchy objectives of this study were: to estimate genetic diversity within and among populations of clonal species Goodyera repens from different populations in northeastern Poland, and to amount factors shaping the genetic structure of this orchid. Based on 451 rosettes of G. repens from 11 localities in northeastern Poland, we conducted a genetic population analysis using allozymes. We included information on population size, flowering, fruit set and seed dispersal to elucidate their influences on genetic diversity of this species. Populations differed according to demographic properties. The majority of seeds (86.4-94.8 %) were found at a distance of 0.2 m. We observed a high level of genetic (P (PL) = 50 %, A = 1.68, H (O) = 0.210, H (E) = 0.204) and genotypic diversity (G = 163, G/N (S) = 0.66, G (U) = 30.2 %), and low but statistically significant genetic differentiation among populations (F (ST) = 0.060 P < 0.001). We suggest that the genetic diversity of G. repens is mainly an effect of the abundance of pine and spruce forest communities suitable for this species in NE Poland and the high level of sexual reproduction.

The cytoplasm of some muscle cells contains secretory granules that by sizes and morphology can be classified as formed, mature, and dissolved forms. By the 18th day of incubation the majority of cardiomyocytes is already differentiated, and the amount of their secretory granules increases. Under conditions of hypoxia, after three days, in myoendocrine cells there are noted features of accelerated secretion of the peptides that are synthesized earlier and are accumulate in the granules, while after one weak-features of acceleration of their synthesis. It can be concluded that in chick embryos, at least from the 14th day of incubation, the system of the heart natriuretic peptides participates in regulation of hemodynamics and of water-salt balance and responds to hypoxia.

Here, we used, for the first time, climate-based ecological niche models (ENMs) to test hypotheses about ecological divergence and speciation processes between sister species pairs of lemurs (genus Eulemur) in Madagascar. We produced ENMs for eight species, all of which had significant validation support. Among the four sister species pairs, we found nonequivalent niches between sisters, varying degrees of niche overlap in ecological and geographic space, and support for multiple divergence processes. Specifically, three sister-pair comparisons supported the null model that niches are no more divergent than the available background region. These findings are consistent with an allopatric speciation model, and for two sister pairs (E.collaris-E.cinereiceps and E.rufus-E.rufifrons), a riverine barrier has been previously proposed for driving allopatric speciation. However, for the fourth sister pair E.flavifrons-E.macaco, we found support for significant niche divergence, and consistent with their parapatric distribution on an ecotone and the lack of obvious geographic barriers, these findings most strongly support a parapatric model of speciation. These analyses thus suggest that various speciation processes have led to diversification among closely related Eulemur species.

For instance, epistatic interactions determine the topography of the fitness landscape and affect the dynamics and determinism of adaptation. However, few empirical data are available, and comparing results is complicated by confounding variation in the system and the type of mutations used. Here, we take a systematic approach by quantifying epistasis in two sets of four beneficial mutations in the antibiotic resistance enzyme TEM-1 beta-lactamase. Mutations in these sets have either large or small effects on cefotaxime resistance when present as single mutations. By quantifying the epistasis and ruggedness in both landscapes, we find two general patterns. First, resistance is maximal for combinations of two mutations in both fitness landscapes and Decemberlines when more mutations are added due to abundant sign epistasis and a pattern of diminishing returns with genotype resistance. Second, large-effect mutations interact more strongly than small-effect mutations, suggesting that the effect size of mutations may be an organizing principle in understanding patterns of epistasis. By fitting the data to simple phenotype resistance models, we show that this pattern may be explained by the nonlinear dependence of resistance on enzyme stability and an unknown phenotype when mutations have antagonistically pleiotropic effects. The comparison to a previously published set of mutations in the same gene with a joint benefit further shows that the enzyme's fitness landscape is locally rugged but does contain adaptive pathways that lead to high resistance.

Rugged fitness landscapes and epistasis between beneficial mutations could explain coexistence among emerging lineages. To provide an experimental test of this notion, we investigated epistasis among four pleiotropic mutations in rpoS, mglD, malT, and hfq present in two coexisting lineages that repeatedly fixed in experimental populations of Escherichia coli. The mutations were transferred into the ancestral background individually or in combination of double or triple alleles. The combined competitive fitness of two or three beneficial mutations from the same lineage was consistently lower than the sum of the competitive fitness of single mutantsa clear indication of negative epistasis within lineages. We also found sign epistasis (i.e., the combined fitness of two beneficial mutations lower than the ancestor), not only from two different lineages (i.e., hfq and rpoS) but also from the same lineage (i.e., mglD and malT). The sign epistasis between loci of different lineages indeed indicated a rugged fitness landscape, providing an epistatic explanation for the coexistence of distinct rpoS and hfq lineages in evolving populations. The negative and sign epistasis between beneficial mutations within the same lineage can further explain the order of mutation acquisition.

In this work, we analysed patterns of genetic diversity from several populations of three cichlid species from Lake DNA control region. We sampled populations inhabiting the littoral rocky habitats in both very deep and very shallow areas of the lake. We hypothesized that the former would constitute relatively older, more stable and genetically more diverse populations, because they should have been less severely affected by the well-documented episodes of dramatic water-level fluctuations. In agreement with our predictions, populations of all three species sampled in very shallow shorelines showed traces of stronger population growth than populations of the same species inhabiting deep shorelines. However, contrary to our working hypothesis, we found a significant trend towards increased genetic diversity in the younger, demographically less stable populations inhabiting shallow areas, in comparison with the older and more stable populations inhabiting the deep shorelines. We interpret this finding as the result of the establishment of metapopulation dynamics in the former shorelines, by the frequent perturbation and reshuffling of individuals between populations due to the lake-level fluctuations.

Despite its applicability to questions of paleontological interest, there are few studies on integration in fossil vertebrates. In this study, we examine limb integration in the Lower Jurassic ichthyosaur Stenopterygius quadriscissus, with the aim of examining the effect of ontogeny and anagenetic changes over short geological time spans on metrics of limb integration. Both ontogenetic and stratigraphic effects had a significant influence on measured values of integration, the identity of strongly integrated elements, and some common ratio values such as the relative integration of the forelimb to the hind limb, or within-limb to between-limb integration. Ontogenetic effects were relatively greater, although this could be linked to sample size. Although adults showed the lowest levels of overall integration, they possessed high levels of integration between serially homologous elements, something that was unexpected due to strong divergence in limb size and perhaps functional differences in derived ichthyosaurs. Ontogenetic differences in the relative integration of the forelimb to the hind limb are probably related to early locomotor demands on the forelimb. We conclude that if samples are pooled, the resulting pattern of integration may not reflect any one subsample but will be a composite created through the superposition of several variables. Pooling data in paleontological studies of integration has a non-trivial effect on the results obtained.

In dinosaurs, ontogenetic studies have nearly exclusively focused on changes in the cranial and post-cranial skeleton, whereas ontogenetic changes in the endocranium have received little attention. Here, we present digital reconstructions of the brain and inner ear anatomy of two ontogenetic stages of the Jurassic ornithischian dinosaur Dysalotosaurus lettowvorbecki. Results show that the endocranial anatomy underwent considerable changes during growth, including a rostrocaudal elongation of the olfactory apparatus, a reduction in the cephalic and pontine flexure and an increase in cerebellum size. Functional elements, such as the cerebral hemispheres and the inner ear, were already well developed in early ontogenetic stages, indicating a large degree of precociality. The anisotropic pattern of size and shape changes in the endocranium further indicates that ontogenetic trajectories may be controlled by functional and environmental demands in the different growth stages in Dysalotosaurus lettowvorbecki. The occurrence of similar ontogenetic patterns in the endocranial anatomy of derived ornithopod dinosaurs suggests a more widespread distribution of this growth trajectory.

Stream impoundments (reservoirs) alter riverine ecosystems worldwide, exposing stream fishes to uncommon selective pressures. Assessing phenotypic trait divergence in reservoir habitats will be a first step in identifying the potential evolutionary and ecological consequences of stream impoundments. We tested for body shape divergence in four stream-adapted fishes found in both habitats within three Septemberarate basins. Shape variation among fishes was partitioned into shared (exhibited by all species) and unique (species-specific) responses to reservoir habitats. All fishes demonstrated consistent significant shared and unique morphological responses to reservoir habitats. Shared responses were linked to fin positioning, Decemberreased body depths and larger caudal areas traits likely related to locomotion. Unique responses were linked to head shape, suggesting species-specific responses to abiotic conditions or changes to their trophic ecology in reservoirs. Our results high-light how human-altered habitats can simultaneously drive similar and unique trait divergence in native populations.

The New Zealand freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum is ideally suited to address this knowledge gap because obligately sexual individuals often coexist with multiple independently derived obligately asexual lineages. This unusual situation allows direct comparisons both between sexual and asexual P. antipodarum and across populations that differ in the relative frequency of sexual individuals. As such, P. antipodarum has received a great deal of attention as a model system for the maintenance of sex in nature and is also used as a model for environmental toxicology and biological invasions. Molecular genetic resources for P. antipodarum will thus be useful to investigators in a variety of biological fields. We used 454 sequencing of cDNA libraries to generate transcriptomes from two sexual and two asexual P. antipodarum lineages. A de Novembero assembly of 116.7Mb of sequence reads produced 41396 contigs, and sequence similarity-based Gene Ontology annotations were obtained for 3740 contigs. We detected 408315 SNP loci and 7315 microsatellite loci, which together represent the first genome-scale resource available for P. antipodarum. Raw 454 read sequences, contig sequences, annotation data and polymorphism data are publicly available in a searchable online database and for download at http://www.biology.uiowa.edu/neiman/transcriptome.php.

Although the monophyly and interrelationships among the three principal groupsthe chordates, the echinoderms, and the hemichordatesare well established, as are the internal relationships among the echinoderm and chordate taxa, the interrelationships among the principal groups of hemichordatesthe harrimaniid enteropneusts, the ptychoderid enteropneusts, and the pterobranchsremain unresolved. Depending on the study some find enteropneusts paraphyletic with pterobranchs (e.g., Cephalodiscus) more closely related to the harrimaniid enteropneusts (e.g., Saccoglossus) than either are to the ptychoderid enteropneusts (e.g., Ptychodera), whereas other studies support a monophyletic Enteropneusta. To try and resolve between these two competing hypotheses, we turned to microRNAs, small approximate to 22 nt non-coding RNA genes that have been shown to shed insight into particularly difficult phylogenetic questions. Using deep sequencing we characterized the small RNA repertoires of two hemichordate species, Cephalodiscus hodgsoni and Ptychodera flava, and the crinoid echinoderm Antedon mediterranea, and combined our results with the described complements of the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii, the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and the starfish Patiria miniata. Our data unambiguously support the monophyly of Enteropneusts as S. kowalevskii shares 12 miRNA sequences with P. flava that are not present in the C. hodgsoni or A. mediterranea libraries, and have never been reported from another metazoan taxon. Thus, these data resolve the phylogenetic position of pterobranchs, ultimately allowing for a better understanding of body plan evolution throughout the deuterostomes. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev.

This subject has attracted substantial attention for more than a century and recently fueled a burst of modern phylogenetic studies. Conflicting scenarios from different studies and incongruent results from nuclear versus mitochondrial Marchkers challenge current molecular phylogenetic approaches. Here we analyze the presently most comprehensive data sets of mitochondrial genomes from non-bilaterian animals to illuminate the phylogenetic relationships among early branching metazoan phyla. The results of our analyses illustrate the value of mitogenomics and support previously known topologies between animal phyla but also identify several problematic taxa, which are sensitive to long branch artifacts or missing data.

The good news is that only three possibilities are seriously considered. The bad news is that all three possibilities are seriously considered. Paleontologists favor a root anchored by Xenarthra (e.g., sloths and anteater), whereas molecular evolutionists have favored the two other possible roots: Afrotheria (e.g., elephants, hyraxes, and tenrecs) and Atlantogenata (Afrotheria + Xenarthra). Now, two groups of researchers have scrutinized the largest available genomic data sets bearing on the question and have come to opposite conclusions, as reported in this issue of Molecular Biology and Evolution. Needless to say, more research is needed.

The formation of these wrinkles is known to be an active process, controlled by the autonomic nervous system. Such an active control suggests that these wrinkles may have an important function, but this function has not been clear. In this study, we show that submerged objects are handled more quickly with wrinkled fingers than with unwrinkled fingers, whereas wrinkles make no difference to manipulating dry objects. These findings support the hypothesis that water-induced finger wrinkles improve handling submerged objects and suggest that they may be an adaptation for handling objects in wet conditions.

We show that the total selection acting on an allele can be divided into a component deriving from adaptation of the trait mean, a component of canalizing selection favoring alleles that epistatically reduce the effects of other allele substitutions, and a component of conservative selection disfavoring rare alleles. While canalizing selection operates in both stable and fluctuating environments, it may not typically maximize canalization, because it gets less efficient with increasing canalization, and reaches a balance with drift, mutation and indirect selection. Fluctuating selection leads to less canalized equilibria than stabilizing selection of comparable strength, because canalization then becomes influenced by erratic correlated responses to shifting trait adaptation. We conclude that epistatic systems under bounded fluctuating selection will become less canalized than under stabilizing selection and may support moderately increased evolvability if the amplitude of fluctuations is large, but canalization is still stronger and evolvability lower than expected under neutral evolution or under patterns of selection that shift the trait in directions of positive (reinforcing) epistasis.

Four measurements were taken and combined into principal components by means of a principal components analysis. Akaike's information criterion models indicated that skull size of the red fox and the Eurasian badger is positively related to the year of collection and negatively to altitude but not to latitude or longitude. However, for the Eurasian badger, the relationship between skull size and year is only on the verge of significance. We suggest that the increase in skull size with year is a result of improved food availability during the 20th Century from man-made resources such as agricultural produce and garbage, and the Decemberrease in skull size with altitude is possibly the result of a parallel Decemberrease in priMarchy productivity.(c) 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 108, 579-585.

We divided and sampled the eggs in five zones, 1 through 5 from blunt top to more pointed bottom. A geometric model composed of a hemisphere, cone, and paraboloid was used to estimate total and zonal volumes and surface areas. The 138 x 67 mm idealized Troodon egg has a volume, surface area, and mass of 296.4 cm(3), 239.23 cm(2), and 314.2 g, respectively. Zonal surface areas and volumes highlight the strongly asymmetric and elongate form of the Troodon egg. Geometric modeling provides better estimates of volume and surface area where egg shape diverges Marchkedly from that of a typical bird egg. Porosity varies significantly across both Troodon eggs, with zones 2 and 3 having the largest pores and a majority (70-78%) of total conductance, whereas zone 5 has very low conductance. Total water vapor conductance in the two eggs are 31.85 and 40.62 mg H2O day(-) Torr(-), values 76% and 97% of those predicted for an avian egg of similar size. Low total conductance compares favorably to values in extant birds and non-avian reptiles that incubate in open nests, arguing against full burial incubation. Together with nesting site evidence, low conductance values favor partial burial and incubation by a Troodon adult. Asymmetric egg shape concentrates volume, surface area, and conductance near or at the point of subaerial exposure. Among non-avian dinosaurs, the eggs of Troodon and troodontids are most similar to those of modern birds in having an asymmetric shape, low porosity, no ornamentation, and three structural eggshell layers.

AMERICAN NATURALIST	climate model niche conservatism niche evolution speciation theory	ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION PROMOTE SPECIATION NICHE CONSERVATISM HYBRID STERILITY POLYGENIC TRAITS EVOLUTION BIRDS INCOMPATIBILITY	Variation in climatic conditions over space and time is thought to be an important driver of speciation. However, the role of climate has not been explored in the theoretical literature on speciation, and the theory underlying empirical studies of climate and speciation has come largely from informal, verbal models. In this study, we develop a quantitative model to test a relatively new but theoretically untested model of speciation (speciation via niche conservatism) and to examine the climatic conditions under which speciation via niche conservatism and speciation via niche divergence are most plausible. Our results have three broad implications for the study of speciation: (1) ecological similarity over time (niche conservatism) can be an important part of speciation, despite the traditional emphasis on ecological divergence, (2) long-term directional climate change promotes speciation via niche conservatism for species with low climatic-niche lability, whereas climatic oscillations promote speciation via niche divergence for species with high climatic-niche lability, and (3) population extinction can be a key component of speciation.

However, in many cases, the consequences of regulatory mutations on patterns of gene expression and ultimately phenotypic differences remain elusive. A standard way to study the genetic architecture of expression variation in model systems has been to map gene expression variation to genetic loci (Fig.1a). At the same time, in many nonmodel species, especially for long-lived organisms, controlled crosses are not feasible. If we are to expand our understanding of the role of regulatory mutations on phenotypes, we need to develop new methodologies to study species under ecologically relevant conditions. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Verta etal. () present a new approach to analyse gene expression variation and regulatory networks in gymnosperms (Fig.1b). They capitalized on the fact that gymnosperm seeds contain an energy storage tissue (the megagametophyte) that is directly derived from a single haploid cell (the megaspore). The authors identified over 800 genes for which expression segregated in this maternally inherited haploid tissue. Based on the observed segregation patterns, these genes (Mendelian Expression Traits) are most probably controlled by biallelic variants at a single locus. Most of these genes also belonged to different regulatory networks, except for one large group of 180 genes under the control of a putative trans-acting factor. In addition, the approach developed here may also help to uncover the effect of rare recessive mutations, which usually remain hidden in a heterozygous state in diploid individuals. The appeal of the work by Verta etal. () to study gene expression variation is in its simplicity, which circumvents several of the hurdles behind traditional expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, and could potentially be applied to a large number of species.

Whereas rampant intra-generic DNA transfers were recently shown to have a pivotal role in the evolution of the most common of these endosymbionts, Wolbachia, the present study show that inter-generic DNA transfers also commonly take place, constituting a potent source of rapid genomic change. Bioinformatic, molecular and phylogenetic data provide evidence that a selfish genetic element, the insertion sequence ISRpe1, is widespread in the Wolbachia, Cardinium and Rickettsia endosymbionts and experiences recent (and likely ongoing) transfers over long evolutionary distances. Although many ISRpe1 copies were clearly expanding and leading to rapid endosymbiont diversification, degraded copies are also frequently found, constituting an unusual genomic fossil record suggestive of ancient ISRpe1 expansions. Overall, the present data highlight how ecological connections within the arthropod intracellular environment facilitate lateral DNA transfers between distantly related bacterial lineages.

While many studies have focused on mechanisms that pattern the jaw skeleton, much remains to be understood about the origins of Novemberelty and diversity in the closely associated musculature. To address this issue, we focused on parrots, which have acquired two anatomically unique jaw muscles: the ethmomandibular and the pseudomasseter. In parrot embryos, we observe distinct and highly derived expression patterns for Scx, Bmp4, Tgf beta 2 and Six2 in neural crest-derived mesenchyme destined to form jaw muscle connective tissues. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis reveals that cell proliferation is more active in the cells within the jaw muscle than in surrounding connective tissue cells. This biased and differentially regulated mode of cell proliferation in cranial musculoskeletal tissues may allow these unusual jaw muscles to extend towards their new attachment sites. We conclude that the alteration of neural crest-derived connective tissue distribution during development may underlie the spatial changes in jaw musculoskeletal architecture found only in parrots. Thus, parrots provide valuable insights into molecular and cellular mechanisms that may generate evolutionary Novemberelties with functionally adaptive significance.

It has been hypothesized that VSRs are engaged in a molecular 'arms race' with RNAi pathway genes. Two lines of evidence support this. First, VSRs from plant viruses display high sequence diversity, and are frequently gained and lost over evolutionary time scales. Second, Drosophila antiviral RNAi genes show high rates of adaptive evolution. Here, we investigate whether VSRs diversify faster than other genes and, if so, whether this is a result of positive selection, as might be expected in an arms race. By analysis of 12 plant RNA viruses, we show that the relative rate of protein evolution is higher for VSRs than for other genes, but that this is not attributable to pervasive positive selection. We argue that, because evolutionary time scales are extremely different for viruses and eukaryotes, it is improbable that viral adaptation (as measured by the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous change) will be dominated by one-to-one coevolution with eukaryotes. Instead, for plant virus VSRs, we find strong evidence of episodic selection-diversifying selection that acts on a subset of lineages-which might be attributable to frequent shifts between different host genotypes or species.

We used population genetic approaches to gain insights into the genetic diversity, patterns of evolutionary differentiation and to Decemberipher the taxonomic status of some of the controversial taxa within the genus Vitis. The distance- and model-based analyses were used to examine the phylogenetic structure within the genus Vitis using simple sequence repeat (SSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) Marchkers. The results closely matched the current classification, but some discrepancies in the identity of taxa at the specific and subspecific levels were still evident. The East Asia and the North American Vitis exhibited strong divergence and each group showed further differentiation into several subgroups with North American subgroups roughly matching the described series. The model based cluster analysis indicated 14 clusters as optimum to explain the genetic structure within the genus Vitis with most clusters containing a moderate frequency of admixed genotypes suggesting interspecific gene flow within the subgenus Vitis. Hierarchical partitioning of molecular variation indicated that a significant amount of the total variation (similar to 74 % and similar to 69 % for SSRs and AFLPs, respectively) is accounted for by intraspecific variation as compared to the levels due to genetic differentiation among species within series (similar to 17 % and similar to 20 % for SSRs and AFLPs, respectively) and among series within the genus Vitis (similar to 9 % and similar to 10 % for SSRs and AFLPs, respectively). Overall, Vitis possesses mild genetic structure characterized by reticulation and incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms.

Sexual selection and individual or group recognition have been identified as major forces in its evolution. While important in the development of vocal displays, vocal learning also allows signal copying in social interactions. Such copying can function in addressing or labelling selected conspecifics. Most examples of addressing in non-humans come from bird song, where matching occurs in an aggressive context. However, in other animals, addressing with learned signals is very much an affiliative signal. We studied the function of vocal copying in a mammal that shows vocal learning as well as complex cognitive and social behaviour, the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). Copying occurred almost exclusively between close associates such as mother-calf pairs and male alliances during Septemberaration and was not followed by aggression. All copies were clearly recognizable as such because copiers consistently modified some acoustic parameters of a signal when copying it. We found no evidence for the use of copying in aggression or Decembereption. This use of vocal copying is similar to its use in human language, where the maintenance of social bonds appears to be more important than the immediate defence of resources.

The consequence is a population of pink salmon that is segmented into spawning groups that use the same limited habitat. We synthesize published observations with results of new analyses to demonstrate that genetic variation of these traits results in survival differentials related to that variation, and that density-dependent embryo mortality and seasonally variable juvenile mortality are a mechanism of selection. Most examples of local adaptation in natural systems depend on observed correlations between environments and fitness traits, but do not fully demonstrate local adaptation: that the trait is genetically determined, exhibits different fitness in common environments or across different environments, and its variation is mechanistically connected to fitness differences. The geographic or temporal scales of local adaptation often remain obscure. Here, we show that heritable, fine-scale differences of timing of reproductive migration in a pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) resulted in temporal structure that persisted several generations the differences enable a density-dependent population to pack more spawners into limited spawning habitat, that is, enhance its fitness. A balanced trade-off of survivals results because embryos from early-migrating fish have a lower freshwater survival (harsh early physical conditions and disturbance by late spawners), but emigrant fry from late-migrating fish have lower Marchine survivals (timing of their vernal emergence into the estuarine environment). Such fine-scale local adaptations increase the genetic portfolio of the populations and may provide a buffer against the impacts of climate change.

Our main result is to show that the portion of the opportunity for selection that is caused by variation for any trait is equal to the product of its selection gradient and its selection differential. This relationship is a corollary of the first and second fundamental theorems of natural selection, and it permits one to investigate the portions of the total opportunity for selection that are involved in directional selection, stabilizing (and diversifying) selection, and correlational selection, which is important to morphological integration. It also allows one to determine the fraction of fitness variation not explained by variation in measured phenotypes and therefore attributable to random (or, at least, unknown) influences. We apply our methods to a human data set to show how sex-specific mating success as a component of fitness variance can be Decemberoupled from that owing to prereproductive mortality. By quantifying linear sources of sexual selection and quadratic sources of sexual selection, we illustrate that the former is stronger in males, while the latter is stronger in females.

We examined the genetic variability (13 microsatellite loci) in 869 out-migrating smolt and post-spawning kelt samples, collected from 1985 to 2011 for a total of 22 annual collections and a 30year span of assigned cohorts. We estimated the annual effective number of breeders (Nb) and the generational effective population size (Ne) through genetic methods and demographically using the adult sex ratio. Comparisons between genetic and demographic estimates show that the adult spawners inadequately explain the observed Ne estimates, suggesting that mature male parr are significantly increasing Nb and Ne over the study period. Spawning as parr appears to be a viable and important strategy in the near absence of adult males.

This type of data is commonly collected during viral epidemics and is sometimes available from different species in ancient DNA studies. We derive the distribution of ages of nodes in the tree under a birth death-sequential-sampling (BDSS) model and use it as the prior for divergence times in the dating analysis. We implement the prior in the MCMCtree program in the PAML package for divergence dating. The BDSS prior is very flexible and, with different parameters, can generate trees of very different shapes, suitable for examining the sensitivity of posterior time estimates. We apply the method to a data set of SIV/HIV-2 genes in comparison with a likelihood-based dating method, and to a data set of influenza Hi genes from different hosts in comparison with the Bayesian program BEAST. We examined the impact of tree topology on time estimates and suggest that multifurcating consensus trees should be avoided in dating analysis. We found posterior time estimates for old nodes to be sensitive to the priors on times and rates and suggest that previous Bayesian dating studies may have produced overconfident estimates.

Both rDNA families are organized within several rDNA loci within all three subgenomes of the allohexaploid species. Both families have undergone different patterns of evolution. The 45S rDNA family has evolved in a concerted manner: internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences residing within the arrays of two subgenomes out of three got homogenized toward one major ribotype, whereas the third subgenome contained a minor proportion of distinct unhomogenized copies. Homogenization mechanisms such as unequal crossover and/or gene conversion were coupled with the loss of certain 45S rDNA loci. Unlike in the 45S family, the data suggest that neither interlocus homogenization among homeologous chromosomes nor locus loss occurred in 5S rDNA. Consistently with other Triticeae, the 5S rDNA family in intermediate wheatgrass comprised two distinct array types-the long- and short-spacer unit classes. Within the long and short units, we distinguished five and three different types, respectively, likely representing homeologous unit classes donated by putative parental species. Although the major ITS ribotype corresponds in our phylogenetic analysis to the E-genome species, the minor ribotype corresponds to Dasypyrum. 5S sequences suggested the contributions from Pseudoroegneria, Dasypyrum, and Aegilops. The contribution from Aegilops to the intermediate wheatgrass' genome is a new finding with implications in wheat improvement. We discuss rDNA evolution and potential origin of intermediate wheatgrass.

Full-sib families of progeny of wild polymorphic charr from two lakes where morphs vary in their degree of phenotypic and ecological divergence were split, with half of the offspring reared on a benthic and half on a limnetic type of diet to estimate family norms of reaction. We focused on variation in craniofacial traits because they are probably functionally related to diet and complement a previous study of body shape in these charr. A hierarchical analysis of phenotypic variation between lakes, pairs of morphs within each lake, and two families within each morph found that phenotypic variation partitioned between families relative to morphs was reduced in the more ecologically diversified population, which is consistent with adaptive diversification. The effect size of plastic responses between lake populations was similar, suggesting little difference in the degree of canalization in contrast to a previous analysis of body form plasticity. Thus, the role that plastic morphological responses play in the adaptive diversification of morphs and different lake populations of Arctic charr may depend on the trait.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 108, 702-714.

In this sample, four composite measures of phenotypic traits showed significant differences along the 18-km geographical cline extending from lowlands to highlands. Compared with lowland birds, highland birds had larger and more pointed beaks, and thicker tarsi, but smaller feet and claws. Finches in an intervening agricultural zone had predominantly intermediate trait values. In a second, Marchk-recapture study we analyse selection on morphological traits among birds recaptured across years (2000-2005) in lowland and highland habitats. Birds were more likely to survive in the highlands and during the wet season, as well as if they had large beaks and bodies. In addition, highland birds exhibited higher survival rates if they had small feet and pointed beaks - attributes common to highland birds as a whole. Lowland birds were more likely to survive if they possessed the opposite traits. Selection therefore reinforced existing morphological divergence, which appears to reflect local adaptation to differing resources during the predominantly drought-ridden conditions that characterized the 5-year study. Alternative explanations - including genetic drift, matching habitat choice, deformation by parasites, and the effects of wear - received little or no support.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 45-59.

Six had already used been for teleost phylogeny (IRBP, MC1R, MLL4, Pkd1, Rhodopsin, and RNF213) at other scales, and one (MLL2) is new. The results corroborate the composition of Serraniformes described in previous publications (some Gasterosteiformes, Perciformes and Scorpaeniformes). Within the clade, Notothenioidei and Zoarcoidei are each monophyletic. Cottoidei was not monophyletic due to placement of the genus Ebinania (Psychrolutidae). Our independent data confirm the sister-group relationship of Percophidae and Notothenioidei as well as the division of Platycephaloidei in four different groups (Bembridae, Platycephalidae, Hoplichthyidae and Peristediidae with Triglidae). Within Cottoidei, Liparidae and Cyclopteridae formed a clade associated with Cottidae, the genus Cottunculus (Psychrolutidae), and Agonidae. Serranidae and Scorpaenidae are not monophyletic, with the Serranidae divided in two clades (Serraninae and Epinephelinae/Anthiinae) and Scorpaenidae including Caracanthidae and the genus Ebinania (Psychrolutidae). We discuss some morphological characters supporting clades within the Scorpaenidae. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The linkage map, which is based priMarchily on amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and genes, consists of 31 linkage groups (LGs consistent with the karyotype). Comparison with the evolutionarily distant Bombyx mori suggests that the gene content of chromosomes is highly conserved. Gene order is conserved on the autosomes, but noticeably less so on the Z chromosome, as confirmed by physical mapping using bacterial artificial chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization (BAC-FISH). Synteny mapping identified three pairs of B. betularia LGs (11/29, 23/30 and 24/31) as being orthologous to three B. mori chromosomes (11, 23 and 24, respectively). A similar finding in an outgroup moth (Plutella xylostella) indicates that the B. mori karyotype (n=28) is a phylogenetically derived state resulting from three chromosome fusions. As with other Lepidoptera, the B. betularia W chromosome consists largely of repetitive sequence, but exceptionally we found a W homolog of a Z-linked gene (laminin A), possibly resulting from ectopic recombination between the sex chromosomes. The B. betularia linkage map, featuring the network of known melanization genes, serves as a resource for melanisnn research in Lepidoptera. Moreover, its close resemblance to the ancestral lepidopteran karyotype (n=31) makes it a useful reference point for reconstructing chromosome dynamic events and ancestral genome architectures. Our study highlights the unusual evolutionary stability of lepidopteran autosomes in contrast, higher rates of intrachromosomal rearrangements support a special role of the Z chromosome in adaptive evolution and speciation.

In particular, we have analyzed the site-specific rate variation across the two priMarchy structural partitions, transmembrane (TM) and extramembrane (EM), of these membrane proteins. We find that TM domains evolve more slowly than do EM domains, though TM domains display increased rate heterogeneity relative to their EM counterparts. Although the majority of residues across GPCRs experience strong to weak purifying selection, many GPCRs experience positive selection at both TM and EM residues, albeit with a slight bias towards the EM. Further, a subset of GPCRs, chemosensory receptors (including olfactory and taste receptors), exhibit increased rates of evolution relative to other GPCRs, an effect which is more pronounced in their TM spans. Although it has been previously suggested that the TM's low evolutionary rate is caused by their high percentage of buried residues, we show that their attenuated rate seems to stem from the strong biophysical constraints of the membrane itself, or by functional requirements. In spite of the strong evolutionary constraints acting on the TM spans of GPCRs, positive selection and high levels of evolutionary rate variability are common. Thus, biophysical constraints should not be presumed to preclude a protein's ability to evolve.

Relative exchange rates and base composition frequencies among amino-acids were calculated using a Marchkov-chain Monte Carlo analysis on a combined data set of 34 proteins sampled among 27 taxa of green plants. The gcpREV model is a better fit than the commonly-used cpREV model to five previously published chloroplast protein test data sets of green plants, but is not a better fit to test data consisting mostly of non-green plant chloroplasts. Consequently, our analyses suggest a degree of specificity of the new model to green plant chloroplast data. The new model is implemented in the software P4, and model description files are available for other popular phylogenetic analysis software. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DNA sequence data of four gene regions (nuclear: 28S, Actin 5C mitochondria]: 16S-ND1, COI) were collected from 263 jumping spider species. The molecular phylogeny obtained by Bayesian, likelihood and parsimony methods strongly supports the monophyly of a Euophryinae re-delimited to include 85 genera. Diolenius and its relatives are shown to be euophryines. Euophryines from different continental regions generally form Septemberarate clades on the phylogeny, with few cases of mixture. Known fossils of jumping spiders were used to calibrate a divergence time analysis, which suggests most divergences of euophryines were after the Eocene. Given the divergence times, several intercontinental dispersal events are required to explain the distribution of euophryines. Early transitions of continental distribution between the Old and New World may have been facilitated by the Antarctic land bridge, which euophryines may have been uniquely able to exploit because of their apparent cold tolerance. Two hot-spots of diversity of euophryines are discovered: New Guinea and the Caribbean Islands. Implications of the molecular phylogeny on the taxonomy of euophryines, and on the evolution of unusual genitalic forms and myrmecophagy, are also briefly discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Although sulfide spring fish convergently evolved divergent phenotypes, it was unclear if mechanisms of reproductive isolation also evolved convergently. Using microsatellites, we found strongly reduced gene flow between adjacent populations from different habitat types, suggesting that local adaptation to sulfidic habitats repeatedly caused the emergence of reproductive isolation. Reciprocal translocation experiments indicate strong selection against immigrants into sulfidic waters, but also variation among drainages in the strength of selection against immigrants into nonsulfidic waters. Mate choice experiments revealed the evolution of assortative mating preferences in females from nonsulfidic but not from sulfidic habitats. The inferred strength of sexual selection against immigrants (RIs) was negatively correlated with the strength of natural selection (RIm), a pattern that could be attributed to reinforcement, whereby natural selection strengthens behavioral isolation due to reduced hybrid fitness. Overall, reproductive isolation and genetic differentiation appear to be replicated and direct consequences of local adaptation to sulfide spring environments, but the relative contributions of different mechanisms of reproductive isolation vary across these evolutionarily independent replicates, highlighting both convergent and nonconvergent evolutionary trajectories of populations in each drainage.

By resequencing evolved genomes, we identified parallel changes in genes encoding transcription regulators within and between environments. Depending on both the environment and the altered gene, genetic parallelism at the gene level involved mutations that affected identical codons, protein domains or were widely distributed across the gene. Evolved clones were characterized by parallel phenotypic changes in their respective evolution environments but also in the three alternative environments. Phenotypic parallelism was high for clones that evolved in the same environment, even in the absence of genetic parallelism. By contrast, clones that evolved in different environments revealed a higher parallelism in correlated responses when they shared mutated genes. Altogether, this work shows that after an environmental change or the colonization of a new habitat, similar ecological performance might be expected from individuals that share mutated genes or that experienced similar past selective pressures.

Microorganisms dominate in terms of numbers of lineages, numbers of organisms, biomass and evolutionary inNovemberations. Yet much remains to be learned about our microbial neighbours. We have gotten to know a few species that have been transformed into laboratory rats (i.e. model organisms), but even here our understanding of the natural history of these lineages remains inadequate as there are few data from populations living in natural habitats. Zufall et al. (2013) move beyond this trend by providing insights into the natural history of Tetrahymena thermophila, a ciliate that has been used in many studies of cellular and molecular biology. Characterization of T. thermophila sampled from numerous ponds across this ciliate's range in Eastern North America reveals the following: (i) considerable differentiation among isolates, with the greatest diversity among lineages in New England, and (ii) a relatively small effective population size for this model ciliate. Such population data are fundamental for inferences about the origins of the numerous reMarchkable features of T. thermophila.

We describe and analyze the simplest case: by adding a third taxon into the normal procedure of QTL mapping between pairs of taxa, such inferences can be made along lineages to a presumed common ancestor. Although comparisons of QTL maps among species can identify homology of QTLs by apparent co-location, lineage-specific mapping of QTL can classify homology into (1) orthology (shared origin of QTL) versus (2) paralogy (independent origin of QTL within resolution of map distance). In this light, we present a graphical method that identifies six modes of QTL evolution in a three taxon comparison. We then apply our model to map lineage-specific QTLs for inbreeding among three taxa of yellow monkey-flower: Mimulus guttatus and two inbreeders M. platycalyx and M. micranthus, but critically assuming outcrossing was the ancestral state. The two most common modes of homology across traits were orthologous (shared ancestry of mutation for QTL alleles). The outbreeder M. guttatus had the fewest lineage-specific QTL, in accordance with the presumed ancestry of outbreeding. Extensions of lineage-specific QTL mapping to other types of data and crosses, and to inference of ancestral QTL state, are discussed.

The nucleotide data set was recovered using a pre-existing amino acid data set of almost 48 000 aligned sites as a backbone for tBLASTn searches against NCBI. In addition, orthology determinations of the loci in the original amino acid data set were scrutinized using an All vs All Reciprocal Best Hit approach, employing BLASTp, and examining for statistical interdependency among the loci. This approach revealed considerable sequence redundancy among the loci in the original data set and a new data set was compiled, with the redundancy removed. The newly compiled nucleotide data set, the original amino acid data set, and the new reduced amino acid data set were subjected to parsimony analyses and two forms of bootstrap resampling. The last-named data set also was analysed using a maximum-likelihood approach. There were two main objectives to these analyses: (i) to examine the general topology, including support, resulting from the analyses of the new data sets and (ii) to assess the consistency of the branching patterns across optimality criteria by comparison with previous probabilistic approaches. The phylogenetic hypotheses resulting from analyses of the three data sets are largely unsupported, reflecting the continued difficulty of finding numerous, reliable, and suitable loci for a group as ancient as Annelida. Resulting parsimonious hypotheses disagree, in some respects, with the previous probabilistic approaches Sedentaria and, in most cases, Errantia are not supported as monophyletic groups but Pleistoannelida is recovered as a (unsupported) monophyletic group in one of the three parsimony analyses as well as the likelihood analysis. In addition, we performed missing data titration studies to estimate the impact of missing data on overall support and support for specific clades. (C) The Willi Hennig Society 2013.

We recover two major acanthurid clades, Nasinae and Acanthurinae, and infer a much more recent Nasinae crown age (17 Ma) compared to a previous dating study for Naso. The Acanthurinae represent an older group that originated similar to 42 Ma, with most diversification occurring since the Early Miocene (beginning similar to 21 Ma). Our results strongly support a paraphyletic Acanthurus and Ctenochaetus, with multiple analyses recovering a clade grouping Ctenochaetus, A. nubilus and A. pyroferus. Contrary to previous studies, we also provide strong evidence that thick-walled, gizzard-like stomachs evolved only once within Acanthurus and that this morphology has a common origin in Acanthurus and Ctenochaetus. Based on our molecular analyses, in conJunection with the large body of morphological evidence, we recommend dissolving the genus Ctenochaetus into the genus Acanthurus. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The dehiscent fruits of Hydatellaceae are unique among angiosperms. Earlier studies suggested the follicle as a primitive type of dehiscent angiosperm fruit, developing from a conduplicate carpel. In contrast with follicles, the single-seeded apocarpous (or unicarpellate) dehiscent fruits of Hydatellaceae dehisce by three equally spaced valves Septemberarating from three fruit ribs. There is no evidence of pseudo-monomery. In mature fruits, all cell layers except the outer epidermis of the ovary are obliterated, so that only one pericarp layer (the exocarp) remains, except in the regions around the vascular bundles and at the fruit apex and base. Morphological cladistic analyses reveal data incongruence between characters describing fruit morphology and other morphological features of Hydatellaceae, including those linked with dioecy/monoecy. As a result, strict consensus trees inferred from maximum parsimony analyses based on each of the two sub-sets of morphological data are more resolved than ones inferred from the analysis of the entire morphological dataset. Fruit characters correspond closely with the recently published molecular phylogeny of the sole genus, Trithuria. The occurrence of an apparently rudimentary mechanical tissue at the fruit apex of most Hydatellaceae with indehiscent fruits suggests that the stem group of Hydatellaceae was characterized by dehiscent fruits with lignified endocarp fibres. The occurrence of Strelitzia-type surface waxes characteristic of Trithuria sect. Trithuria provides further evidence of the homoplasy of this epicuticular wax type at the scale of seed plants.

We show that the standard way of setting up Bayes factor tests of the monophyly of a group, or the placement of a sample sequence in a known reference tree, can be misleading. The reason for this is related to the well-known dependency of Bayes factors on model-specific priors. Specifically, when testing tree hypotheses it is important that each hypothesis is associated with an appropriate tree space in the prior. This can be achieved by using appropriately constrained searches or by filtering trees in the posterior sample, but in a more elaborate way than typically implemented. If it is difficult to find the appropriate tree sets to be contrasted, then the posterior model odds may be more informative than the Bayes factor. We illustrate the recommended techniques using an empirical test case addressing the issue of whether two genera of diving beetles (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae), Suphrodytes and Hydroporus, should be synonymized. Our refined Bayes factor tests, in contrast to standard analyses, show that there is strong support for Suphrodytes nesting inside Hydroporus, and the genera are therefore synonymized.

Departing from an infinitesimal model, we perform an asymptotic limit to derive the system introduced in Kirkpatrick and Barton (1997). We then perform a further simplification to obtain a simple model. Thanks to this simpler equation, we can describe rigorously the dynamics of the population. In particular, we provide an explicit estimate of the invasion speed, or extinction speed of the species. Numerical computations show that this simple model provides a good approximation of the original infinitesimal model, and in particular describes quite well the evolution of the species' range.

We assembled excerpted 94-residue Urgenes for class I tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) and class II Histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS) from a diverse group of species, by identifying and catenating three blocks coding for secondary structures that position the most highly conserved, active-site residues. The codon middle-base pairing frequency was 0.35 +/- 0.0002 in all-by-all sense/antisense alignments for 211 TrpRS and 207 HisRS sequences, compared with frequencies between 0.22 +/- 0.0009 and 0.27 +/- 0.0005 for eight different representations of the null hypothesis. Clustering algorithms demonstrate further that profiles of middle-base pairing in the synthetase antisense alignments are correlated along the sequences from one species-pair to another, whereas this is not the case for similar operations on sets representing the null hypothesis. Most probable reconstructed sequences for ancestral nodes of maximum likelihood trees show that middle-base pairing frequency increases to approximately 0.42 +/- 0.002 as bacterial trees approach their roots ancestral nodes from trees including archaeal sequences show a less pronounced increase. Thus, contemporary and reconstructed sequences all validate important bioinformatic predictions based on descent from opposite strands of the same ancestral gene. They further provide Novemberel evidence for the hypothesis that bacteria lie closer than archaea to the origin of translation. Moreover, the inverse polarity of genetic coding, together with a priori alpha-helix propensities suggest that in-frame coding on opposite strands leads to similar secondary structures with opposite polarity, as observed in TrpRS and HisRS crystal structures.

The new form constitutes the oldest unequivocal representative of this extant ophiuroid family, significantly extending its stratigraphical range. The first cladistic analysis of the Ophiacanthidae including all extant genera suggests L. gracilispina holds a basal, but not the basalmost, position within the family, forming a sister group with the extant Ophiomedea and Ophiopristis to the other ophiacanthids except for Ophiologimus, which itself is sister to all other ophiacanthids. These results imply that ophiacanthids originated in the pre-Carnian. A critical re-evaluation of the ophiacanthid fossil record reveals that the vast majority of records consist of dissociated lateral arm plates, which provide no insights into divergence times of the lineages. Among the few records of articulated specimens, only Inexpectacantha acrobatica from the Pliensbachian of France proved sufficiently well-known to yield phylogenetically relevant information. Its position within the ophiacanthid clade indicates that more than half of the extant ophiacanthid lineages, in particular the former ophiacanthinids and ophiotominids, must have diverged by the Pliensbachian.

Population structure delays fixation, and so weakens the effect of a selective sweep. However, favourable alleles spread through a spatially continuous population behind a narrow wavefront ancestral lineages are confined at the tip of this front, and so coalesce rapidly. In extremely dense populations, coalescence is dominated by rare fluctuations ahead of the front. However, we show that for moderate densities, a simple quasi-deterministic approximation applies: the rate of coalescence within the front is lambda similar to 2g(eta)/(rho l), where rho is the population density and l = sigma root 2/s is the characteristic scale of the wavefront g(eta) depends only on the strength of random drift, eta = rho sigma root 2/s. The net effect of a sweep on coalescence also depends crucially on whether two lineages are ever both within the wavefront at the same time: even in the extreme case when coalescence within the front is instantaneous, the net rate of coalescence may be lower than in a single panmictic population. Sweeps can also have a substantial impact on the rate of gene flow. A single lineage will jump to a new location when it is hit by a sweep, with mean square displacement sigma(2)(eff)/sigma(2) = (8/3)(L/l)(Lambda/R) this can be substantial if the species' range, L, is large, even if the species-wide rate of sweeps per map length, Lambda/R, is small. This effect is half as strong in two dimensions. In contrast, the rate of coalescence between lineages, at random locations in space and on the genetic map, is proportional to (c/L)(Lambda/R), where c is the wavespeed: thus, on average, one-dimensional structure is likely to reduce coalescence due to sweeps, relative to panmixis. In two dimensions, genes must move along the front before they can coalesce this process is rapid, being dominated by rare fluctuations. This leads to a dramatically higher rate of coalescence within the wavefront than if lineages simply diffused along the front. Nevertheless, the net rate of coalescence due to a sweep through a two-dimensional population is likely to be lower than it would be with panmixis. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the evolutionary consequences of introgression of domesticated genes back into the wild are poorly understood. By combining high-throughput genotyping with 25 years of long-term ecological field data, we describe the occurrence and consequences of admixture between a primitive sheep breed, the free-living Soay sheep of St Kilda, and more modern breeds. Utilizing data from a 50 K ovine SNP chip, together with forward simulations of demographic scenarios, we show that admixture occurred between Soay sheep and a more modern breed, consistent with historical accounts, approximately 150 years ago. Haplotype-sharing analyses with other breeds revealed that polymorphisms in coat colour and pattern in Soay sheep arose as a result of introgression of genetic variants favoured by artificial selection. Because the haplotypes carrying the causative mutations are known to be under natural selection in freeliving Soay sheep, the admixture event created an opportunity to observe the outcome of a 'natural laboratory' experiment where ancestral and domesticated genes competed with each other. The haplotype carrying the domesticated light coat colour allele was favoured by natural selection, while the haplotype associated with the domesticated self coat pattern allele was associated with Decemberreased survival. Therefore, we demonstrate that introgression of domesticated alleles into wild populations can provide a Novemberel source of variation capable of generating rapid evolutionary changes.

A confirmed hybrid zone for the closely related Neotropical primates Alouatta palliata and A. pigra has provided a unique opportunity to study primate hybrid morphological variation. Here we used molecular evidence based on mitochondrial, Y-chromosome, and autosomal data to assess hybrid ancestry. We conducted univariate and multivariate statistical comparisons of morphometric data collected from individuals both outside and within the hybrid zone in Tabasco, Mexico. Our results show that of all the hybrids detected (N = 128), only 12% of them were approximately genetically intermediate, and none of them were first generation hybrids. Univariate pairwise comparisons among parental individuals, multigenerational backcrossed hybrids, and intermediate hybrids showed that overall, multigenerational backcrossed hybrids resemble the parental species with which they share most of their alleles. Conversely, intermediates were highly variable. Similarly, principal component analysis depicts an overlap between the parental species and their backcrosses when considering overall morphological differences. Finally, discriminant function analysis of the morphological variables was overall unreliable for classifying individuals into their assigned genotypic classes. Taken together, our results suggest that primate natural hybridization studies should incorporate molecular methods for determining ancestry, because morphology may not always be a reliable indicator of hybrid status. Hybrid zones could comprise a large number of multigenerational backcrossed hybrids that are indistinguishable from the parental species. The implications for studying hybridization in the primate fossil record are discussed. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

While physiological stress responses play a crucial role in preparing escape responses, the increased metabolic rates and shunting of energy away from other body functions, including antioxidant defence, may generate costs in terms of increased oxidative stress. Here, we test whether predation risk increases oxidative damage in Enallagma cyathigerum damselfly larvae. Under predation risk, larvae showed higher lipid peroxidation, which was associated with lower levels of superoxide dismutase, a major antioxidant enzyme in insects, and higher superoxide anion concentrations, a potent reactive oxygen species. The mechanisms underlying oxidative damage are likely to be due to the shunting of energy away from antioxidant defence and to an increased metabolic rate, suggesting that the observed increased oxidative damage under predation risk may be widespread. Given the potentially severe fitness consequences of oxidative damage, this largely overlooked non-consumptive effect of predators may be contributing significantly to prey population dynamics.

Most of the proposed advantages of sex rely on the benefits obtained from recombination. However, it is still unclear whether the conditions under which these recombinatorial benefits would be sufficient to maintain sex in the short term are met in nature. Our study addresses a largely overlooked hypothesis, proposing that sex could be maintained in the short term by advantages due to functions linked with sex, but not related to recombination. These advantages would be so essential that sex could not be lost in the short term. Here, we used the fungus Aspergillus nidulans to experimentally test predictions of this hypothesis. Specifically, we were interested in (i) the short-term deleterious effects of recombination, (ii) possible nonrecombinatorial advantages of sex particularly through the elimination of mutations and (iii) the outcrossing rate under choice conditions in a haploid fungus able to reproduce by both outcrossing and haploid selfing. Our results were consistent with our hypotheses: we found that (i) recombination can be strongly deleterious in the short term, (ii) sexual reproduction between individuals derived from the same clonal lineage provided nonrecombinatorial advantages, likely through a selection arena mechanism, and (iii) under choice conditions, outcrossing occurs in a homothallic species, although at low rates.

But still, the phylogenetic relationships among the orders and infraorders remain a matter of discussion. The rapidly increasing mitochondrial genome sequences from diverse insect species provide the opportunity to explore miscellaneous evolutionary questions in the superclass Hexapoda. A combined priMarchy sequence analyses of the complete available data set has not yet been performed. Until now phylogenetic analyses of subsets of selected taxa resulted to strong supported topologies showing in some instances discrepancies between morphological and nuclear data. This circumstance started the discussion about the limits of complete mitochondrial genomes for inferring deep hexapod relationships. By using the hitherto densest taxon sampling of Hexapoda our analyses resulted in discrepancies to the current phylogenetic hypotheses based on morphological and nuclear data, e.g. monophyly of hexapods and some hexapods orders, e.g. Diptera, Hemiptera and Orthoptera. Nonetheless, compared to previously published studies that strongly support systematically erroneous groups using a sparse taxon sampling, our analyses had no support for theses discrepancies. Consequently, we highly recommend interpreting mt-genome based phylogenies with incomplete representation of major orders/taxa particularly for hexapods with cautions although the inferred relationships are highly supported.

Here I present evidence for the abscission of penultimate branch systems within early so-called walchian conifers-trees with a plagiotropic branching pattern. The specimens studied originate from a middle Early Permian gymnosperm-dominated flora within the middle Clear Fork Group of north-central Texas. Complete branch systems of three walchian conifer morphotypes are preserved all have pronounced swellings and smooth Septemberaration faces at their bases. The source plants grew in a streamside habitat under seasonally dry climatic conditions. The evolution of active branch abscission appears to correspond to an increase in the size of conifers, and this combination potentially contributed to the restructuring of conifer-rich late Paleozoic landscapes. Moreover, trees shedding branch systems and producing abundant litter have the potential to affect the fire regime, which is a factor of evolutionary importance because wildfires must have been a source of frequent biotic disturbance throughout the hyperoxic Early Permian.

In endangered species, adaptive potential may be eroded by Decemberreased population sizes and processes that further reduce gene flow such as philopatry and local adaptations. Here, we focused on the philopatric and endangered loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nesting in Cape Verde as a model system to investigate the link between adaptive potential and philopatry. We produced a dataset of three complementary genomic regions to investigate female philopatric behaviour (mitochondrial DNA), male-mediated gene flow (microsatellites) and adaptive potential (major histocompatibility complex, MHC). Results revealed genetically distinct nesting colonies, indicating reMarchkably small-scale philopatric behaviour of females. Furthermore, these colonies also harboured local pools of MHC alleles, especially at the Marchgins of the population's distribution, which are therefore important reserves of additional diversity for the population. Meanwhile, directional male-mediated gene flow from the Marchgins of distribution sustains the adaptive potential for the entire rookery. We therefore present the first evidence for a positive association between philopatry and locally adapted genomic regions. Contrary to expectation, we propose that philopatry conserves a high adaptive potential at the Marchgins of a distribution, while asymmetric gene flow maintains genetic connectivity with the rest of the population.

Y-linked modifiers that restore a normal sex ratio might be abundant and favored when a X-linked distorter is present. Here we investigated natural variation of Y-linked suppressors of sex-ratio in the Winters systems and the ability of these chromosomes to modulate gene expression in Drosophila simulans. Seventy-eight Y chromosomes of worldwide origin were assayed for their resistance to the X-linked sex-ratio distorter gene Dox. Y chromosome diversity caused males to sire similar to 63% to similar to 98% female progeny. Genome-wide gene expression analysis revealed hundreds of genes differentially expressed between isogenic males with sensitive (high sex ratio) and resistant (low sex ratio) Y chromosomes from the same population. Although the expression of about 75% of all testis-specific genes remained unchanged across Y chromosomes, a subset of post-meiotic genes was upregulated by resistant Y chromosomes. Conversely, a set of accessory gland-specific genes and mitochondrial genes were downregulated in males with resistant Y chromosomes. The D. simulans Y chromosome also modulated gene expression in XXY females in which the Y-linked protein-coding genes are not transcribed. The data suggest that the Y chromosome might exert its regulatory functions through epigenetic mechanisms that do not require the expression of protein-coding genes. The gene network that modulates sex ratio distortion by the Y chromosome is poorly understood, other than that it might include interactions with mitochondria and enriched for genes expressed in post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis.

We identified human X-linked genes whose gametologs have been pseudogenized or completely lost from the Y chromosome and inferred which evolutionary forces may be acting to retain genes on the Y. Although gene loss appears to be largely correlated with the suppression of recombination, we observe that X-linked genes with functional Y homologs evolve under stronger purifying selection and are expressed at higher levels than X-linked genes with nonfunctional Y homologs. Additionally, we support and expand upon the hypothesis that X inactivation is priMarchily driven by gene loss on the Y. Using linear discriminant analysis, we show that X-inactivation status can successfully classify 90% of X-linked genes into those with functional or nonfunctional Y homologs.

(2012). Evaluating molecular support for and against the monophyly of the Peritrichia and phylogenetic relationships within the Mobilida (Ciliophora, Oligohymenophorea). Zoologica Scripta,00, 000000. An ongoing debate in ciliate molecular phylogenetic analyses is whether the Peritrichia composed of the Sessilida and the Mobilida are monophyletic. To further investigate this group, here we increase taxon sampling with four further mobilids: Trichodinella sp., Trichodina pectenis, Urceolaria serpularum and Urceolaria korschelti. Results show that support for and against monophyly of the peritrichs depends on different methods of alignment, and different methods of masking ambiguously aligned nucleotide positions. Results from constrained analyses also are dependent on different alignment and masking methods. We propose that there is no well-supported SSU-rDNA evidence supporting for and against the removal of the mobilids from the peritrichs. Within the Mobilida, we find that Trichodinella nest within Trichodina, Urceolaria branch basally, and Trichodina are non-monophyletic, and suggest that Leiotrocha be formally transferred into Urceolaria. In addition, the data support that Urceolaria-like denticles and Urceolaria-/Trichodina-like adoral ciliary spiral are plesiomorphic conditions within the mobilids.

The phylogenetic position of Z. shennongensis is determined using DNA sequences of nuclear ribosomal ITS and three plastid regions (rbcL, psbA-trnH, trnL-F). Zhengyia shennongensis is readily distinguished from the related genera Urtica, Hesperocnide, and Laportea in the tribe Urticeae by its seed (oblong-globose or subglobose and not compressed achenes, surface densely covered with nipple-shaped protuberances) and stipule morphology (large leaf-like stipules with auriculate and amplexicaulous base and united with stem). Phylogenetic evidence indicates that Zhengyia is a distinct group related to Urtica (including Hesperocnide) species and Laportea cuspidata in tribe Urticeae. The bulbiliferous species of the tribe (L. bulbifera, L. cztspidata, Z. shennongensis) do not form a clade. This result indicates that the bulbil trait evolved in parallel within Urticeae. Our findings highlight the importance of shady and moist habitats in promoting species diversification and the parallel evolution of morphological traits that are likely to be adaptive.

The bacterium Campylobacter jeJunei is a widespread zoonotic multihost pathogen, which frequently causes gastroenteritis in humans. Poultry products are important transmission vehicles to humans, but the bacterium is common in other domestic and wild animals, particularly birds, which are a potential infection source. Population genetic studies of C. jeJunei have mainly investigated isolates from humans and domestic animals, so to assess C. jeJunei population structure more broadly and investigate host adaptation, 928 wild bird isolates from Europe and Australia were genotyped by multilocus sequencing and compared to the genotypes recovered from 1366 domestic animal and human isolates. Campylobacter jeJunei populations from different wild bird species were distinct from each other and from those from domestic animals and humans, and the host species of wild bird was the major determinant of C. jeJunei genotype, while geographic origin was of little importance. By comparison, C. jeJunei differentiation was restricted between more phylogenetically diverse farm animals, indicating that domesticated animals may represent a Novemberel niche for C. jeJunei and thereby driving the evolution of those bacteria as they exploit this niche. Human disease is dominated by isolates from this Novemberel domesticated animal niche.

Its closely related sister species Z. pseudotritici and Z. ardabiliae infect wild grasses in the same region. This recently emerged host-pathogen system provides a rare opportunity to investigate the evolutionary processes shaping the genome of an emerging pathogen. Here, we investigate genetic signatures in plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) that are likely affected by or driving coevolution in plant-pathogen systems. We hypothesize four main evolutionary scenarios and combine comparative genomics, transcriptomics, and selection analyses to assign the majority of PCWDEs in Z. tritici to one of these scenarios. We found widespread differential transcription among different members of the same gene family, challenging the idea of functional redundancy and suggesting instead that specialized enzymatic activity occurs during different stages of the pathogen life cycle. We also find that natural selection has significantly affected at least 19 of the 48 identified PCWDEs. The majority of genes showed signatures of purifying selection, typical for the scenario of conserved substrate optimization. However, six genes showed diversifying selection that could be attributed to either host adaptation or host evasion. This study provides a powerful framework to better understand the roles played by different members of multigene families and to determine which genes are the most appropriate targets for wet laboratory experimentation, for example, to elucidate enzymatic function during relevant phases of a pathogen's life cycle.
